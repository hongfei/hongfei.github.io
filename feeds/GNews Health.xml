I am in a suburban shopping complex on a Tuesday afternoon, getting a massage from an Aescape robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aescape &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/about" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; itself as a “pioneering lifestyle robotics company” that is “revolutionizing the wellness industry by introducing exceptional massage experiences”. Put simply, they make robot masseuses: cushioned tables with two large, white, robotic arms that rub your body based on your preferences and preselected programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I love massages – I am never happier than when the profane flesh sack I call my body is being kneaded like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WHs7CLJErmQ" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Wagyu beef&lt;/a&gt;. So I opt for a 30-minute “Power Up”, which costs $60 and promises to leave me feeling “invigorated and alert”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ccording to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/benefits-of-massage-therapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mayo Clinic Health System&lt;/a&gt;, massage therapy can help with a number of conditions including anxiety, depression, sports injuries, digestive disorders, headaches and soft tissue sprains. It can also improve circulation, strengthen the body’s immune response, lower stress levels and increase energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But is a massage from a machine as good as a massage from a person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2cd87f66-3485-4c1b-aab5-b832a3d228c2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is lymphatic drainage massage and why do celebrities love it?","elementId":"2cd87f66-3485-4c1b-aab5-b832a3d228c2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/feb/22/what-is-lymphatic-drainage-massage-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There are so many contraptions out there. My mom has a massage chair and I use a Theragun at home,” says Crista de la Garza, a board-certified massage therapist in Colorado. While there can be value in these tools, De la Garza says she is not worried about a robot coming for her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;First, there are real physical benefits to being touched by a person. During the early pandemic, for example, when people were isolating and social distancing, many reported feeling “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/28/the-power-of-touch-is-this-the-sense-we-have-missed-most" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;skin hunger&lt;/a&gt;” – a sense of deprivation and abandonment that comes from not getting enough physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A 2024 paper in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01841-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; said that receiving touch was “of critical importance” and found that touch interventions helped reduce pain and feelings of depression and anxiety in adults. The paper also found that touch interventions from objects or robots “resulted in similar physical benefits, but lower mental health benefits”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is a powerful thing to be touched safely and appropriately and therapeutically,” says De la Garza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In fairness, Aescape’s &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/faqs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; says it “is not about replacing therapists”. Instead, “it’s about enhancing their work and addressing the industry’s labor shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="937245ad-92c8-4a5f-85cf-95756c168898" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A robot masseuse made by Aescape.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Aescape&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nothing can replace a human,” the efficient, blond receptionist tells me when I arrive for my appointment. I’m late because of parking woes, but the machine doesn’t care. It’s a regular spa, with manicures, pedicures, human massages and crystals for sale at the front desk. On our way to the robot’s chamber, she says the Aescape has been popular, especially with clients who “aren’t comfortable being touched by a stranger”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inside, she hands me a high-compression, Aescape-branded top and leggings to &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/news/what-to-wear-to-a-massage" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wear&lt;/a&gt; during my treatment. Apparently, they help enhance the machine’s “body detection”. I lie down on the table and hold very still while the Aescape scans my body. She shows me the screen controls and an emergency button that I can press if anything goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What kind of music would I like to listen to? Lo-fi ambient jazz, classic rock or a playlist called “brat”? I can view an unsettlingly detailed outline of my body – they didn’t need to depict my saddle bags so clearly – or soothing videos of the ocean, a snowy mountain or a rainy forest. I can adjust the height of my headrest and change the pressure of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the things that makes De la Garza skeptical about robot massage is that it “makes you think too much”. Getting massaged by a person involves more surrender – the therapist controls most of the experience, she says, and the client can turn off their brain: “The client’s job is to breathe, communicate as needed, and simply be in a relaxed state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Indeed, I find myself distracted by the urge to tweak the music and scenery. Do I like looking at snow? It’s OK. Can I relax to the “brat” playlist? No – back to ambient lo-fi. Is that really what my butt looks like?

What if the powerful robotic arms skewered my soft flesh like a pile of antipasti? I, on the other hand, was more worried it wouldn’t be strong enough, and that my knots of tension would remain coiled and tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the massage is enjoyable. The robot’s blunt, plastic hands are gently warmed. They can’t knead and poke as precisely as human fingertips, but their ministrations feel pleasant. Actually, the hands are more like knobs, roughly the size and shape of small Dutch clogs. It feels a little like someone pressing their fist into your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the end of my session, I feel looser and more relaxed than I had at the beginning. I don’t feel invigorated, exactly, but I do think I could drop into a deep, dreamless sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is certainly no substitute for a real massage. I like the surrender and precision of a normal massage, and the Aescape can’t massage the head, hands or feet. But if I can see myself going again if I feel particularly sore after a workout, or if I find myself roaming around a suburban shopping center with 30 minutes to kill. It’s relatively cheap, and you don’t have to tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 16:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQOU5SWDNlSEFvOGw4TEZ1RlN3aEdzMkxRdk5aZnlXVGZEVThBY2ZMZW5Lb2JFcG1QWWh5RXBZYlMxZVp5RG1JSWJLMnlDM2FEX3Fvdi1pdFBHSE83ZTZidjBCLVN4aUFsUEZBRzRwcm0zV0dvd2dvbjFJUHNsSFI1ZC0wVXJKbHN0</guid></item><item><title>南美锥虫病或致命的接吻虫病已在美国蔓延。-哥伦比亚广播公司新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chagas-disease-deadly-kissing-bug-spread-us/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;

Labeling the United States as non-Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting," the report noted, adding the insect has been reported in 32 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states with human cases include California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report notes that data is "inadequate" to prove that the insects are increasing in geographic distribution or abundance. But it also says that the bugs are "increasingly recognized" because of frequent encounters with humans and due to more research attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Invasion into homes, human bites, subsequent allergic reactions or exposure to T. cruzi parasites, and increasing frequency of canine diagnoses have led to growing public awareness," it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes Chagas disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites found in triatomine or "kissing" bugs, which can pass the disease to other animals and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/chagas-disease-which-can-be-deadly-now-considered-endemic-us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, the insect's nickname comes from the bug often biting people on the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 8 million people globally and 280,000 in the United States have the disease, often without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People might scratch or rub bug feces into a bite wound, their eyes, or mouth without realizing it, which allows the parasite to enter their body," the CDC says, adding bugs pass the parasite in their droppings after biting a person or animal. "If these droppings get into someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease does not spread from person to person like a cold, nor does it spread through casual contact with those infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without treatment, the condition can be life-threatening, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the acute phase, which happens shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Romaña's sign may appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This happens when the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite gets into the eyelid, usually by accidentally rubbing the bug feces into your eye or into a bug bite near your eye," the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other acute signs may include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may experience symptoms for years or a lifetime, which is known as the chronic phase of infection, and can include heart and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"(The disease) can destroy the nerves that feed the various parts of your body — so your heart, your esophagus, your colon," infectious disease physician Tom Moore &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/chagas-disease-kissing-bug-north-delaware-valley-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told CBS News Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2019 as cases made their way north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both stages, some people might not feel sick while others can have serious health problems, the CDC adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to avoid kissing bugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease at this time, according to the CDC, so it's important to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention methods include staying in well-built places if traveling, using insecticides and bug spray, wearing clothes that cover your skin and not eating raw fruits and vegetables, as the infection can also be acquired orally or through the mouth via contaminated food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also previously told CBS News Philadelphia that homeowners can seal windows and keep trash, piles of wood and rocks away from their homes to reduce risk. &lt;/p&gt;

Our team found COVID-19 booster shots available at many locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, multiple pharmacy employees said the vaccines could only be administered with a prescription to people who are either 65 or older or have underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those rules could change after the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy (ACIP) meets later this month to discuss recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has been reevaluating decades of U.S. vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP recommendations on COVID-19 boosters could impact the price and availability of the vaccine in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could be a lot easier, or a lot more difficult, to get this vaccine than it is today," said Will Humble, executive director of the AZ Public Health Association, "and it could also change whether your health insurance plan is going to pay for it or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several governors are not waiting for the CDC committee to act. They are making their own state recommendations to ensure the immunizations will be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, was still weighing her options this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm certainly concerned about new guidance coming out around protections for COVID," Hobbs told reporters on Wednesday. "We're going to look at the options we have to keep Arizonans safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can reach ABC15 Senior Investigator Melissa Blasius by email at &lt;u&gt;melissa.blasius@abc15.com&lt;/u&gt; or call 602-803-2506.

      &lt;p&gt;Pneumonia struck first. Then tonsillitis spiraled into sepsis. Malaria battered him next, and after treatment, the other illnesses flared back up again. This unvaccinated 2-year-old boy is trapped in a relentless cycle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very sad. I knew these things could be prevented by vaccines," his mother Alzhraa Fadul says through an interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I feel guilty that I can't do anything to help my son," the 26-year-old adds. "I'm worried about my son every day. I should've gotten vaccines for my son."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there was nowhere for Fadul to get them. Her family lives in an abandoned classroom with 10 strangers in Kosti, Sudan, where vaccination campaigns were once &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/ar/sdn/sudan-news/sudan-launches-yellow-fever-vaccination-campaign-among-ethiopian-refugees-and-host-communities.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hailed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a "remarkable achievement" and &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/sdn/sudan-news/sudan-kicks-off-november-subnational-polio-immunization-campaign-to-vaccinate-45-million-children.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the country a coveted polio-free status one decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That all changed in April 2023 when civil war &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/27/1172123699/sudan-conflict-explained" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;broke out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sudan rapidly rose to the top of the list of countries with the highest proportions of unvaccinated newborns — claiming an unwanted leading position last year, with more than half of its babies missing all immunizations. Fadul's son is &lt;a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/" target="_blank"&gt;one of the 14 million kids&lt;/a&gt; worldwide who don't receive any vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're really in the eye of the storm here," &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/sudan/unicef-representative-sudan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sheldon Yett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says. Yett, who is UNICEF's representative in the country, adds that &lt;a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/no-end-sight-sudans-two-years-war" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 70%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the country's health facilities in conflict-affected areas are in "ruins." "Children who would have otherwise been able to brave the many things that Sudan throws at children are far more vulnerable. Life is pretty grim."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea and Yemen join Sudan among the hardest-hit countries with immunization programs in dire straits. Two of those countries — Sudan and Yemen — &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/11/26/247297862/violence-increases-in-central-african-republic" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2024/whats-happening-in-the-central-african-republic" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;active&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2023/06/21/1183192685/yemeni-civil-war-frontline-photos" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;war zones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In all, &lt;a href="https://prezly.msf.org.uk/a-shot-at-life-how-to-reach-more-children-in-humanitarian-settings-with-lifesaving-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 55%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of unvaccinated kids live in conflict-affected areas. "Being a child growing up in those contexts, you've got the odds stacked up against you," says &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/events/detail/2025/06/03/south-east-asia-events/webinar-on-immunization-and-vaccine-research-area-prioritization-for-the-who-south-east-asia-region" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Naor Bar-Zeev&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While vaccine experts note that vaccine hesitancy &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/1/6" target="_blank"&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt; in these regions, they say that's not the main reason that children &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09169-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;miss vaccinations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In most cases, it's either lack of awareness among caregivers or lack of access to health facilities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It wasn't my choice not to vaccinate my child. It was war that prevented me," Fadul explains. "I would sell everything I have to get a vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The leading causes of infection among unvaccinated kids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The things we actually worry about are the horses rather than the zebras," &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/staff/conway-james/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. James Conway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says. Conway, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, uses this metaphor to explain that while rare complications — zebras — can occur, it's important for physicians to first focus on preventing the most common causes of serious illness — the horses. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," Conway adds, noting this cliché is truer than ever in countries like Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210065" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Two of those&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "horses" are pneumococcal disease and rotavirus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal disease often causes pneumonia, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-204247" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide for all children under 5, with an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;annual toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of about 700,000.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rotavirus is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciad060" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most common culprit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for diarrhea in that same under age 5 group in lower resource countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Conway says both are especially dangerous for kids living in crowded environments because those infections are more likely to spread and become dangerous once a child is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Overcrowding enhances the transmission of respiratory infections like pneumococcal pneumonia because tight living conditions increase the frequency of person-to-person interactions. Densely populated areas often also have limited access to clean water and sanitation, which facilitates the spread of diarrheal diseases through contaminated water, food and surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's sort of like a bucket of gasoline just waiting for somebody to throw a match in," Conway explains. "All it takes is the introduction of one of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccines have been available for decades to prevent both pneumococcal disease and rotavirus. In many parts of the Global South, vaccination campaigns target both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in low-resource settings, "access to even basic medical care can be really compromised" because of conflict and other factors, Conway notes. And that would have an impact on vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other factors that worsen outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The millions of children who don't get vaccines may face other formidable challenges if they fall ill. Malnutrition &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-062122-014910" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the production of cells used by the immune system to fight off infections, increasing the risk of disease. Various micronutrient deficiencies can also worsen outcomes. For instance, vitamin A deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the risk of severe complications and death from measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As that battle rages, malnourished kids don't develop an appropriate immune response," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once infected, the body demands even more energy to fend off infection, leading to a vicious cycle. "These infections can progress rather quickly, especially in small babies," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pneumonia kills nearly three-quarters of a million kids a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cough and difficulty breathing are usually the &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.9039" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first signs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once the microbe hijacks the body, it damages the lung tissue, making breathing more difficult. It's almost like trying to breathe through a sponge soaked with water.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the lungs lose their ability to exchange gases, organs receive less oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Eventually, you succumb to the inability to breathe properly and oxygenate your blood," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the infection &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccc.2017.08.005" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;overwhelms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the body, severe drops in blood pressure further starve vital organs of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2308.151550" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that some children die of pneumonia in as few as two days. "These things can progress rather, rather quickly," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The danger doesn't end with pneumonia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Looming over unvaccinated children is yet another deadly threat: diarrhea. It comes from many sources, but many kids get immunized against rotavirus — the leading cause of diarrhea in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In high-income countries, diarrhea is fairly common but rarely life-threatening because of widespread access to clean water and sanitation, rehydration therapy and adequate nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The data look starker for children in the Global South. That's because patients with diarrhea are treated with oral rehydration. Conway says, "Oral rehydration is something that we take for granted, but it's really not readily available in a lot of these settings."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As with other infections, malnutrition worsens outcomes for kids with diarrhea. A large study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001256" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that children with malnutrition and diarrhea were four times more likely to die compared with those with diarrhea and sufficient nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30230-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Unreliable access&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to life-saving treatment and poor rotavirus vaccine coverage create a deadly combination. Diarrhea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30114-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;accounts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for about one in 10 deaths among children under 5 in low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ongoing diarrhea and vomiting can rapidly lead to dehydration. "We've all been dehydrated out hiking or doing something on a hot day, and you get a headache. Gradually, that transitions to being just more and more lethargic, where these kids just don't have the energy to move and do anything," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If dehydration isn't treated, circulating blood volume and blood pressure plummet. As in pneumonia, the blood pressure drop deprives vital organs of oxygen. The body's balance of salts, acids and blood sugar is also disrupted, causing damage to organs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once multiple organs cease to function, death is imminent. Depending on the child's health before the illness, death can occur "within a few days" or take a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While the body will do everything possible to maintain blood flow and perfusion of the brain, that's the last thing that starts to suffer," Conway says. "This lethargy then goes into being unresponsive and can progress gradually to coma and then death."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lingering long-term side effects even after survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When resources like antibiotics and oral rehydration are available, some children will recover from vaccine-preventable diseases. But that doesn't mean a child will survive unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As these viruses run throughout the body, any organ can suffer," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles, mumps and other vaccine-preventable diseases can cause debilitating and permanent damage. Conway says it's not the organism itself causing the damage, but rather the immune response to the microbe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is one of the most devastating consequences of measles and mumps, causing deafness in &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 to 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of cases. The complication is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.je20200233" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rarer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with mumps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are quite a few nerves in the body that are quite fine fibers and very susceptible to damage," Conway explains. "Oftentimes, the most vulnerable nerves are the ones that take a hit, and the nerves that impact hearing are really, really vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other complications &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; infertility and blindness. Conway added that intellectual disability is another risk because these infections attack the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nerves are one of the parts of the body that don't recover quickly," Conway says. "You can rebuild lung tissue over time if you survive one of these infections, but nerve tissue just doesn't regrow and replace itself, so many kids do end up with neurologic deficits."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some kids get vaccine-preventable diseases even before they're born&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Newborns can also suffer if their mother isn't immunized against diseases like measles, mumps and rubella. Ideally, pregnant people should receive all recommended vaccines — but there may not be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.039" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for adult immunization. "This idea of immunizing adolescents and adults is just not as common in the Global South," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if the pregnant person does not have immunity to a virus like &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/clinical/files/committee-opinion/articles/2019/01/prepregnancy-counseling.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they're at risk of getting infected. That can lead to miscarriage, fetal death or stillbirth&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another harmful pathogen is rubella — an infection that has some symptoms in common with measles but is generally less severe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the fetus survives an early rubella infection, some babies are born with a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome, which can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12264" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deafness, cataracts, congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental impairment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The birthing process also poses dangers. Pregnant people &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/clinical/files/committee-opinion/articles/2017/09/update-on-immunization-and-pregnancy-tetanus-diphtheria-and-pertussis-vaccination.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;should receive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a dose of the tetanus vaccine during each pregnancy. But if the person giving birth doesn't have immunity to tetanus, non-sterile delivery practices can result in neonatal tetanus. From 2000 to 2020, cases &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7111a2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decreased&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 88% worldwide, with 2,229 being reported in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Neonatal tetanus is heartbreaking," Conway notes. "These babies are incapable of doing anything on their own. They're incapable of breathing on their own because all the muscles in their body are contracted."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emotional toll of missing vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A shadow of guilt follows Fadul, the mother from Sudan. Despite the ongoing war making vaccines scarce, she blames herself for not being able to protect her son.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was sad because I knew we would never get a vaccine," she recounts. "There was no light at the end of the tunnel."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the stress &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228435" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experienced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by parents comes from seeing the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable diseases in their communities, and sometimes in their own children, as with Fadul.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There is this sense of complacency in the U.S.," Conway says. "Once the system is sort of humming along and working well, a lot of these diseases do fade into the background. When you go into lower-resourced areas, there's still familiarity with these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is still an appreciation of vaccines. People not only welcome them, but they demand that their kids get immunized," Conway explains. "Parents, especially mothers, are very wired toward being protective. There's a natural, expected stress that happens when you can't provide whatever it is that your kid needs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Conway thinks that sense of maternal stress is valid. The first 1,000 days of a child's life — a term &lt;a href="https://thousanddays.org/about/our-story/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;popularized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the early 2010s to describe the importance of the first two years of life — are some of the most vulnerable periods for growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first 1,000 days are really, in many ways, going to determine sort of who and what you are," Conway says. "That's part of the reason that I think the support of aid agencies is so critical in these disrupted situations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cuts in U.S. funds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for programs like Gavi, the Vaccine alliance, paint an unclear picture of how Sudan and other countries will handle the many obstacles being thrown their way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fadul's son is now weakened by infection and hunger, though still alive, but she fears he can slip over the edge at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents in America have never seen what I have. I've seen kids die in front of me," Fadul says tearfully. "I don't want another child right now. This would mean two unvaccinated kids. I want to have another child when I know they'll be safe. But life is not stopping in Sudan. Every hour, women are still giving birth. These children will face the same problem my son faced. I hope that one day these children will no longer suffer."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

About 2,500 students attend the school in grades nine through 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials in Wake County, the county in which the school is located, said the person, who was not publicly identified, was present at the school sometime last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Division of Public Health said it is working with Wake County Schools to identify and notify anyone who may have had close contact with the person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-ec98b1f0-8cb3-11f0-91c6-31447f8d929e" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers tuberculosis to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14540025/Woman-contracts-deadliest-virus-wrong-vaccine.html"&gt;deadliest disease in the world&lt;/a&gt; because it kills the most people of any disease, claiming about 1.25million lives every year, mostly in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Announcement of the North Carolina comes just a few days after &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-ec99ea70-8cb3-11f0-91c6-31447f8d929e"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; officials reported three people in the state tested positive for TB. There was no connection between the patients, suggesting each was infected by a different source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were located in the Greater Portland area, officials said, and work is now underway to identify and isolate their close contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There has been a recent uptick in TB cases in the US, with America reporting 10,347 infections in 2024, the most recent year available, up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011 when there were 10,471 cases recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An active case of tuberculosis was reported in someone at Leesville High School in Raleigh, North Carolina (pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The names and ages of the patients have not been revealed. The above shows a chest X-ray of a person with tuberculosis (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say the risk to the public is low, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's CBS17 reported that parents of students in the high school received a notice from the Wake County Health Department’s Communicable Disease division informing them of 'a situation affecting our school.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice did not reveal the 'situation' was a case of TB, but said anyone exposed would be contacted by county officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB was confirmed on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A county spokesperson said in an email to CBS 17: 'We have been notified that an individual with active tuberculosis was present at Leesville [Road] High School last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are working with Wake County Public School System to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with this person. Those individuals will be contacted directly with instructions for tuberculosis testing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, there were 215 TB cases in the state in 2023, the latest confirmed data available. This was an increase from 164 cases in 2022 and the highest in nearly a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preliminary CDC data recorded 250 TB cases in North Carolina last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far in 2025, there have been 128 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB has a high fatality rate, killing up to half of patients if left untreated or unvaccinated. That's far above the fatality rate for Covid, below one percent, measles, 10 percent for untreated patients, and Legionnaire's disease, also around 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis was effectively a death sentence in the 18th and 19th centuries when there was no cure, although it can now be prevented by vaccines and treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis killed more than 16,000 people in the US every year in the 1950s, but deaths have now dropped 28-fold to around 550 people annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tuberculosis infections are on the rise in the US, and nationwide have now reached their highest tally since 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most tuberculosis cases in the US are imported or due to migration into the country, the CDC says, with most patients coming from outside America's borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further details on the North Carolina and Maine cases, including names, ages and exact locations were not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth, warned that tuberculosis could only be passed on if someone was in 'close, prolonged contact' with an infectious person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the Portland Press Herald: 'The vast majority of people do not need to worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not spread through casual contact like shaking hands or sharing a towel. It's much less contagious than influenza or Covid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can take days for the disease to infect a healthy person who lives in the same home as a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine has already reported 28 cases of tuberculosis so far this year, figures show, just 11 cases below the 39 recorded in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children, older adults and those with weaker immune systems are more vulnerable to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms of the disease include a persistent and unexplained cough and sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties, extensive lung damage and the infection may spread to other organs like the liver or back, causing pain in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients die from the disease due to respiratory failure, or when damage to the lungs means they can no longer get enough oxygen into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors can treat the disease with antibiotics and can vaccinate against the disease using a shot called the BCG vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not routinely offered in the US, because the disease is not common, but can be requested for children, and leaves a small circular scar on the arm, a normal response and sign that the vaccine was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also be given to adults, but it is less effective in this group and may lead to someone falsely testing positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In developing countries, the vaccine is administered to children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She has struggled with frequent illness ever since first contracting Covid in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Ever since then, I just catch everything,” she said. Though she expressed her frustrations with a weakened immune system, she had her doubts that she would qualify for vaccine coverage under the new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her immediate worry is simple: not being bedridden on the day she says “I do”. “Weddings are expensive, and I don’t want to be sick that day if I can prevent it, and so I just want to get the vaccine,” she said. “I’ve gotten my booster every year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the new rules have complicated what was once routine. Instead of stopping by CVS, as she has in past years, Heckle found herself on the phone with her insurer, navigating coverage questions and learning she’d need to go to a different pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I just am really hoping that I don’t have to risk being sick on my wedding day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Though she was relieved to find out her vaccine would still be covered in some capacity, she’s still worried that her wedding – attended by people of all age groups – will likely host a significant number of guests who won’t be vaccinated. She doesn’t want anyone to get sick because they were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know how many of the people who will be at my wedding are trying to get vaccinated, or how many qualify,” she said. “It just feels like it’s so much more complicated than it’s ever been before to get a vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For 18-year-old student Zeke Fraser-Plant, the new guidelines heightened concerns he already carries daily. His parents and a close friend continue to live with long-term effects from contracting Covid: “My father has a lot of problems with brain fog. My mother loses her sense of smell completely. It comes back off and on.” His friend, who caught Covid as a teenager, struggles with memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fraser-Plant’s his biggest fear has just been made stronger. “I’m absolutely terrified that I might kill somebody I know by bringing it home to them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Unlike Heckle, Fraser-Plant does not automatically qualify for coverage. He and his family are prepared to pay out of pocket, even considering travel abroad. “It’s also a possibility that we might go out of the country to get the vaccine, if that becomes necessary,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But cost is only part of the concern. As he prepares to enter community college after a year of service with the Washington Conservation Corps, he worries about being surrounded by classmates who are now less likely to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With community college, I mean, it’s a total crapshoot,” he said. “I don’t think most people are going to take it well, if you just walk up and ask them about their vaccination status or how seriously they take Covid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His unease is understandable: his grandmother recently survived cancer, leaving her immune system fragile. He takes every precaution he can – masking, boosters, vigilance – but fears that there’s only so much he can do with an increasingly unvaccinated public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With the way vaccination rates are going, it’s just terrifying,” he said. “I just don’t know why more people don’t take these kinds of things seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Haley, a 40-year-old hairstylist from Portland, Oregon, is anxious about her job as someone who interacts with several people each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I am a person in a public job that would prefer to be vaccinated to protect myself and others, and I don’t know if I’ll qualify now,” she said, adding that she feels that the current administration’s views on vaccines are “very, very dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Roger, an emergency room physician from Alaska, said that healthcare decisions “should be based on scientific evidence, and not based on pseudoscientific ideology”. He says that he still witnesses many people die or become permanently disabled from Covid, and he’s afraid that those numbers are about to soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I fear that as an emergency physician, I will see more unfortunate children and adults becoming ill and dying due to the lies propagated by this administration,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Elena, who is retired and living in Los Angeles, currently has stage 4 cancer and is on chemotherapy. Though she still qualifies for the vaccine, her 59-year-old husband apparently will not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Would my vaccination protect me if the person I live with gets sick? Possibly not,” she said. “And my chemo is incompatible with the only available treatment for Covid. It seems obvious that household members of immune-suppressed patients should also be eligible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Tammy Hansen, a 61-year-old librarian from Illinois, shares similar concerns of infecting a vulnerable loved one with the virus. She is about to become the caretaker for her 85-year-old mother following a major cancer surgery and ongoing chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I want the vaccine so I can double protect her from getting Covid,” Hansen said. “My husband is 79 and I also worry about transmitting Covid to him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “I swear if I get Covid and give it to my mom and she dies, I’ll be taking some kind of action. These fuckers are nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOZFlHaVBFdG9KVzRzVkdPcHNsbWFvWC1BckozSnZkMzFnajg4ZV9BWnhib25EdmE0YXkweENxNVRfT0Frel85Slc3b3dWdDJRVGM0Zm4wR3JiRTNHZUp1LWZ0WTV2U1hURjdVbHZZRnlNVXN2Mzc5LTVmVk9EZ0RyM2U1ZkR3Nk0</guid></item><item><title>“打涂鸦”过程：如何接种流感和新冠疫苗- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/covid-19-flu-vaccine-explainer-21033342.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Still, it has sidelined many who came down with COVID-19 and has some health officials concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five things to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-we-are-not-out-of-the-woods-yet" class="subhead"&gt;1) We are not out of the woods yet.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data released Friday, there are now 14 states with “very high” levels of coronavirus detected in their wastewater — California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Connecticut, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID-19 lab tests are confirming infection also continues to rise statewide and in the Los Angeles area. For the week that ended Aug. 30, California’s COVID test positivity rate was 12.83%, up from 7.05% for the week that ended Aug. 2. In L.A. County, the positive test rate was 14.83%, up from 9.33%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in the sewage of Northern California’s most populous county, Santa Clara, were still considered “high” as of Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-but-there-may-be-signs-were-reaching-the-peak" class="subhead"&gt;2) But there may be signs we’re reaching the peak.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Orange County, the COVID-19 positive test rate was 13.1%. That’s below the prior week’s rate of 18% but still higher than the rate for the week that ended Aug. 2, which was 10.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, the test positivity rate was 8.1% for the week that ended Aug. 30. That’s down from the prior week’s figure of 8.7% but higher than the 5.8% reported for the week that ended Aug. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, wastewater data in L.A. County show that coronavirus levels declined slightly from the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-overall-the-summer-spike-has-been-generally-mild" class="subhead"&gt;3) Overall, the summer spike has been generally mild.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a new variant, there hasn’t been much severe disease from COVID-19 this summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID hospital admissions in California have been increasing — with the latest rate of 3.93 admissions per 100,000 residents for the week ending Aug. 30, up from 2.38, from the week ending Aug. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they remain relatively low statewide and in L.A. County. The number of L.A. County residents seeking care for COVID-related illness, or who have been hospitalized, “is quite a bit lower than during summer surges in 2023 and 2024,” the county’s Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this summer hasn’t seen COVID activity to the extent of a year ago, when the state experienced its worst summer wave since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-but-the-fall-and-winter-are-an-open-question" class="subhead"&gt;4) But the fall and winter are an open question.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mild summer wave could create conditions for problems later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-28/covid-rising-in-california-how-bad-will-this-summer-be"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the state Department of Public Health said that scientists anticipated California would see either a stronger summer COVID wave or a more significant winter wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-there-is-still-massive-confusion-over-the-future-of-covid-vaccines" class="subhead"&gt;5) There is still massive confusion over the future of COVID vaccines.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vaccine skeptic — federal agencies have in effect made it more difficult to get vaccinated against COVID-19 this year. The Food and Drug Administration has “approved” COVID-19 vaccines only for those 65 and older, as well as younger people with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means, across the country, people younger than 65 interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine must now either consult with a healthcare provider or “attest” to a pharmacy that they have an underlying &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;health condition&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a potential hurdle that can make getting the vaccine more difficult and, some health experts worry, prompt even more Americans to eschew getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Hawaii joined California, Washington and Oregon in launching the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/04/hawaii-to-join-west-coast-health-alliance-with-california-oregon-and-washington/" target="_blank"&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt;: an interstate compact meant to provide science-based immunization guidance as an alternative to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear, however, whether the formation of the West Coast Health Alliance would make it easier for people to get COVID-19 vaccines at the nation’s largest pharmacy retailers, where many people get their shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical groups, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, are offering their own recommendations to advise individuals and families on what vaccines they should get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQMjVJaTVDek9JUDVXN2Y5LXY5dzFhQXFoemN1OUFrT0RydW91OE4zVDhEcnJrNVJXQkx2LXhldVpDY0hvemYzX18zWGdXLUw3LWxfd2pveFpOTldSZzMtRWNFS0lPRUZ0dHBGZUpMU21YcTVHYjY1X2NZNzVpd2VjZnRXZnVITGpxQlFfZWtZQ09aakVqREtNY2RXbUFfcmV3dFVyb2lINVllYjd2NW5SM0dtb2VFbWdr</guid></item><item><title>“真正的逆转” ：科学家发现导致大脑衰老的蛋白质，并学习如何阻止它- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/truly-a-reversal-scientists-find-protein-that-causes-brain-aging-and-learn-how-to-stop-it-80715</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;A protein that’s central to brain aging has been discovered by scientists, who’ve gone the extra mile by also finding out how it can be stopped. FTL1, as it’s called, is a key mediator of aging in the hippocampus – a part of the brain that’s particularly badly affected as the years roll by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as people have tried – and boy, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/that-millionaire-who-is-trying-to-de-age-himself-is-now-starting-penis-rejuvenation-therapy-70538" target="_blank"&gt;have they tried&lt;/a&gt; – there is as yet no way to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/putin-and-xi-want-to-achieve-immortality-with-organ-transplants-could-they-80670" target="_blank"&gt;halt&lt;/a&gt; the inexorable march of time and its effects on the human body. In order to tackle aging, scientists first have to understand exactly how it works – what proteins and genes are involved, and how they impact different organs and systems in the body. This new study helps answer some of those long-standing questions as they apply to the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/artificial-sweeteners-like-aspartame-linked-to-16-years-of-extra-brain-aging-in-8-year-study-80669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging,” said senior author Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the Bakar Aging Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, in a &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s study compared old and young male mice. In mouse terms, “old” means 18-22 months of age, and “young”, 2-3 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing in on the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/neurogenesis-confirmed-adult-brains-really-do-make-new-hippocampal-neurons-79875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; – the seahorse-shaped (if you squint) structure at the heart of the brain’s limbic system with vital roles in learning and memory – the team looked for any proteins that differed between the old and young mice. Helpfully, there was just one: FTL1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferritin light chain 1, to give it its full name, is involved in the long-term storage of iron, a vital nutrient. The team saw that its levels were increased in the aged brains, which they suggest in their paper is “likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that extra FTL1 could also negatively affect the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/mitochondria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, each cell’s own mini power station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their observations, they artificially increased levels of FTL1 in the brains of the young mice. Sure enough, their brains &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-is-the-age-when-your-brain-starts-aging-faster-and-it-starts-a-critical-window-78620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;began to appear older&lt;/a&gt;, and they exhibited behavioral signs consistent with advancing age on tests such as navigating a maze and recognizing objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did the same with mouse neuronal cells grown in Petri dishes. Those that had been engineered to produce lots of FTL1 had many fewer branches, or neurites, coming off them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, the opposite was also true. When the FTL1 was artificially decreased in the brains of the older mice, their nerves began making lots of connections again, and they performed better on the cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments,” said Villeda. “It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge, the team hopes to set the stage for new, targeted &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/anti-aging-breakthrough-as-scientists-reverse-aging-with-simple-drug-cocktail-69812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;anti-aging drugs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age,” said Villeda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as helping stave off the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/more-evidence-that-a-daily-multivitamin-could-help-slow-cognitive-decline-in-old-age-72597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cognitive impacts&lt;/a&gt; of aging, they believe there could be more far-reaching consequences. Rare mutations in the &lt;em&gt;Ftl1 &lt;/em&gt;gene in humans cause a disease called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/neuroferritinopathy" target="_blank"&gt;neuroferritinopathy&lt;/a&gt;, where iron buildup in the brain causes progressive difficulties with movement, swallowing, and speaking. There’s also some evidence that iron metabolism is altered in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/alzheimer-s-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team concludes, “[O]ur data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 09:58:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNd09uaE4xU1FGTVF0OTlMTTV0RFJ5T25hMFA0THl2aExuWkhhUnRQOUphY0hSLXBJalI1aDFwenUyTXBHSUtUYUIyRHdDYjdiQ19vbkdCZW5sRlpIbDZhY25UWG9fUUVRNTZTVXQxbU5IMEhVSmFBTUpTRDBfcnZrNktZY3JXUVlsRHRZNm9jNzhtM2VfSW1aaHg5aUNyQlFwU2RuZGo4ZmR2cmQwVF9GWHlabHEzdXRCc3lmMFN2NA</guid></item><item><title>什么样的乳制品对身体有益？科学正在更新答案：疫苗-健康新闻- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5528747/what-kind-of-dairy-does-a-body-good-science-is-updating-the-answer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When new dietary guidelines are unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/31/nx-s1-5519288/the-federal-government-will-issue-new-dietary-guidelines-heres-what-to-expect" target="_blank"&gt;later this month&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration is expected to upend long-held advice on whole milk and its full-fat friends in the dairy aisle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For decades, the American public has been advised to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy options, largely out of concern for limiting the intake of saturated fat in these foods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the public doesn't necessarily follow this advice — cheese is the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724000423?via%3Dihub#sec0007" target="_blank"&gt;leading source&lt;/a&gt; of saturated fat in our diet — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-makes-major-announcement-with-fda-and-international-dairy-foods-association" target="_blank"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; to end the "attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt" and give these foods new prominence in the forthcoming guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, what's the case for ditching skim milk and other low-fat alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehe.osu.edu/human-sciences/directory?id=bruno.27" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human nutrition at the Ohio State University, says the field of nutrition has wrestled over this question for many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of controversy," says Bruno, who has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38669850/" target="_blank"&gt;authored&lt;/a&gt; numerous studies on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Views have evolved in recent years as researchers have started to learn "the saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that saturated fat is linked to heart disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because dairy is such a broad category — and fat content varies widely between foods like milk, yogurt and cheese — it's challenging to make sweeping statements. Yet, Bruno and others in the field say once you dig into the data, the rationale for an across-the-board recommendation to favor skim milk and low-fat dairy quickly falls away.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we are saying that low fat is better than high fat, we should have studies demonstrating that, black and white, because guidelines should be evidence-based," says &lt;a href="https://iid.ulaval.ca/en/members/benoit-lamarche/" target="_blank"&gt;Benoît Lamarche&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec and is a professor at Université Laval.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's why Lamarche &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525001376?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;pulled together&lt;/a&gt; leaders in the field of nutrition last year, including several who had worked on dietary guidelines, to pour over the evidence on dairy fat and its link to cardiometabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The evidence is showing that they have the same effect and the evidence is of low quality and there's just a few studies that have looked at that," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lamarche says the argument against full-fat dairy is largely "circumstantial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier research showed people who were at a higher risk of heart disease tended to have a dietary pattern that included more full-fat dairy, but there were other factors — and foods in their diet— that could explain this finding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't have the strict and rigorous evidence opposing the two types of dairy and their effect on health," he says. "We need to stop distracting people with this recommendation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some recent studies have even signaled that consuming higher-fat dairy is not only neutral, but, in some cases, &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; also carry benefits beyond low-fat options, at least when part of a healthy eating pattern.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523121368?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;small trial&lt;/a&gt; found that participants who followed the "&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" target="_blank"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt;" diet — developed by scientists at the National Institutes of Health to lower hypertension — and substituted high-fat dairy had comparable improvements in blood pressure as those who ate low-fat dairy and better blood lipid levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another study that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-017-0042-5" target="_blank"&gt;followed 18 adults&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for three weeks found drinking whole milk actually outperformed skim milk when it comes to raising HDL, or "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bruno says the hypothesis is that certain bioactive components in the milk fat membrane like phospholipids "alleviate any putative risks that would be associated with that higher intake of saturated fat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key, he says, seems to be how the dairy fat is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22030228/" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; butter — also derived from dairy but primarily composed of fat and water — has the predicted negative consequences on cholesterol; however, that's not true when people consume the same amount of saturated fat in the form of cheese, which comes with calcium, protein, minerals and other components.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Lamarche notes there's &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11704150/" target="_blank"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; from observational studies that cheese is associated with a lower risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Is this real or confounded by something else?" he says. "We don't know, but the data is quite consistent on this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Likewise, there's a well-documented link between yogurt and the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, which led the Food and Drug Administration to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-announces-qualified-health-claim-yogurt-and-reduced-risk-type-2-diabetes" target="_blank"&gt;issue a health claim&lt;/a&gt; on those products (though, of course, the universe of yogurt encompasses everything from whole milk Greek yogurt to sugar-loaded nonfat varieties).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724000423?via%3Dihub#sec0011" target="_blank"&gt;some recent trials&lt;/a&gt; examining higher-fat dairy products show promise, Bruno believes it's "premature to have a one-size-fits-all recommendation that consumers should favor full fat versus nonfat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even when it comes to milk, the evidence is slim in either direction, and Lamarche argues that guidance in the U.S. and Canada should be agnostic on the question for now, until there's better data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its reports, the scientific advisory committee that provides guidance for the federal government on the 2025 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Part%2520A_ExecutiveSummary_FINAL_508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;decided not to change the existing recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in support of low-fat milk because it "could not draw a conclusion about the relationship between consumption of milk with different fat content" — advice that Kennedy may very well ignore given his public comments disparaging the scientific report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/frank-b-hu/" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Hu&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees there still aren't clear answers, meaning there's no reason to start promoting full-fat dairy as superior, especially since a glass of whole milk and cheese comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In his mind though, the much bigger problem is that Americans are mostly consuming dairy products in the form of pizza, burgers, sandwiches and other foods that are "loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In that context, it probably doesn't make much difference if the cheese you are eating is low fat or high fat. On the other hand, it's relatively easy to "incorporate a moderate amount of dairy into your overall diet whether it's full fat or low fat," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're replacing your carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates and sugar, with dairy products, even some full-fat dairy products, that's probably a good thing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The connection between sleep posture and brain health centres around a system that most people have never heard of: the glymphatic system. This network of vessels acts like a nighttime cleaning crew for your brain, flushing out toxic proteins that accumulate during waking hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lev Fomchenkov, CEO of &lt;a href="https://cosmicnootropic.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cosmic Nootropic&lt;/a&gt;, said: “During sleep, the space between your brain cells expands by about 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flow more freely and wash away metabolic waste. This includes proteins like beta-amyloid and tau, which are linked to Alzheimer’s disease when they build up over time.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The position you choose for sleep appears to influence how effectively this cleaning process works significantly, potentially affecting your long-term cognitive health and memory preservation. The glymphatic system operates most efficiently when cerebrospinal fluid can flow freely through the brain's channels. Side-sleeping (specifically lying on your left or right side) appears to allow for better fluid movement compared to back or stomach sleeping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you sleep on your side, gravity actually helps the cerebrospinal fluid circulate more effectively through your brain tissue,” said Fomchenkov. “This improved flow means better clearance of those harmful proteins that can accumulate and contribute to cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference seems significant. Side-sleepers may clear beta-amyloid proteins more efficiently than those who sleep on their backs or stomachs. Back-sleeping can compress certain brain regions, while stomach-sleeping often restricts proper spinal alignment, both of which can impede the glymphatic system's function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Connection Between Toxin Build-Up and Memory Loss&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When your brain can't effectively clear these waste proteins during sleep, they begin to accumulate in areas responsible for memory formation and retention. Beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, don't appear overnight. They build up gradually over years or even decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Think of it like not taking out your trash for weeks,” says Fomchenkov. “Eventually, the accumulation becomes problematic. In the brain, this toxic buildup interferes with neural communication and can lead to the memory problems we associate with ageing and dementia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poor sleep quality or ineffective toxin clearance not only affects older adults, as even younger people who consistently experience disrupted glymphatic function may be setting themselves up for cognitive issues later in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Four Ways to Optimise Your Sleep Position for Brain Health&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Train Yourself to Side-Sleep Gradually&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're a habitual back or stomach sleeper, don't expect to change overnight. Start by placing a pillow behind your back when lying on your side to prevent rolling. After a week or two, your body will begin to adapt to the new position naturally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Use Proper Pillow Support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Side-sleeping requires the right pillow height to maintain spinal alignment. Your pillow should fill the space between your shoulder and neck without tilting your head too far up or down. A pillow that's too high or too low can strain your neck and disrupt sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Add a Knee Pillow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Placing a small pillow between your knees while side-sleeping helps maintain proper hip and spine alignment. This simple adjustment can prevent the lower back strain that often causes people to abandon side-sleeping attempts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Choose the Right Mattress Firmness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Side-sleepers need a mattress that contours to their body while providing adequate support. A mattress that's too firm can create pressure points at the hips and shoulders, while one that's too soft won't provide enough spinal support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The goal is to wake up feeling rested, not stiff or sore,” notes Fomchenkov. “If your sleep position is causing discomfort, your brain won't get the deep, restorative sleep it needs for optimal detoxification.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fomchenkov said: “Most people think about sleep in terms of duration, i.e., getting those recommended eight hours. However, position may also play an important role in brain health. Your sleep posture can influence how effectively your brain performs its nightly maintenance routine. When the glymphatic system can't function properly, you're essentially allowing toxic proteins to accumulate that could affect your memory and cognitive function years down the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What's particularly concerning is that many people dismiss minor sleep discomforts or assume that waking up with a stiff neck is just part of ageing. In reality, these could be signs that your sleep position isn't supporting optimal brain detoxification. Making simple adjustments to how you sleep tonight could be one of the most important investments you make in your long-term cognitive health. The brain's ability to clear waste during sleep is something we should all be paying attention to, especially as we learn more about its connection to neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 07:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNOEpNLXNOWk05MXFOTDZNX1lPbUJVaGJnRUJ2ZzFRRXBRbzBHZmZIcVk5VEt0YzRxTlNqY3doWVNQLWJVS1dES08zOU9GQUdOdjlRZ2w5SE9QMVJyS3RsUzJQNDZLUzFRNk1rc1ktTDUtc3RHa1NST0JybTNYQWoxd1dLZmRrSWtsdnhFbNIBkgFBVV95cUxNM0pCbWtkQ3IzZ0tQT3VRMVhwRHBVMUxLQ09BbDFmRGNnTlRMQlZOTFRPeG0yWDFUZDZCT2xxaGJ3bWN1T1hmaEQwOXBqOXlfVVY0bWJUWENEZW1pckdjSmNVTzRkdmFMNFVla3FtZjMxcFhrdFdUU1YtSHJHdjhWeVh0X1NqS3V2dFZCeDEwbzBMQQ</guid></item><item><title>行人被SF Muni有轨电车撞伤- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/sf-pedestrian-struck-injured-by-muni-streetcar-21036045.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person was involved in a collision with a downtown streetcar in San Francisco on Sunday afternoon, according to the Fire Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First responders arrived at 1129 Market St. just after 4:30 p.m. on a report of a Muni streetcar versus a pedestrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Fire Department, when they arrived the person had "self extricated" and no heavy rescue was required.

When your vitamin D levels are low, it can affect multiple systems in your body, often in subtle ways that are easy to overlook. Deficiency can result from limited sun exposure, poor dietary intake, or medical conditions that impair absorption. Symptoms may include fatigue, frequent illness, muscle weakness, or even mood changes. Recognising these early signs and addressing the deficiency through diet, supplements, or sunlight can help prevent long-term health complications and improve overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when your vitamin D is low: 10 signs to watch&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatigue and tiredness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest signs of low vitamin D is persistent fatigue. Vitamin D helps your body maintain energy by supporting muscle function and overall cellular activity. When levels are insufficient, cells may not function optimally, leading to feelings of tiredness even after adequate sleep. Correcting the deficiency through supplements or sunlight exposure can often help restore energy levels. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912284/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in the Journal Nutrients found that individuals with low vitamin D levels reported higher levels of fatigue and poorer sleep quality. Supplementation with vitamin D improved energy levels and sleep patterns in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequent illness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for a strong immune system. Low levels can weaken your body’s ability to fight infections, making you more prone to colds, flu, or respiratory illnesses. Sunlight exposure, dietary sources like fatty fish, and supplements are common ways to maintain healthy levels. Regular testing and personalized supplementation are important, especially for people living in areas with limited sunlight or those with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to higher disease severity in intensive care patients and increased susceptibility to viral infections like COVID-19. Ensuring adequate vitamin D helps your immune cells respond effectively to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Muscle weakness and pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D plays a vital role in muscle strength and coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in StatPearls notes that insufficient vitamin D levels may lead to muscle weakness, increasing the risk of falls, especially in older adults. Without enough of it, muscles may feel weak or sore, and you could experience cramps or difficulty performing everyday activities. This is because vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphorus in muscle tissues, which are essential for contraction and repair. Low levels also increase the risk of falls, particularly in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Back pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic back pain can be linked to low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D deficiency can weaken bones and muscles, placing extra strain on the spine. Low bone density increases the risk of spinal stress and micro-fractures, especially in the lower back. Supplementing vitamin D in deficient individuals has been shown to help reduce pain in some cases, particularly when combined with calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bone fractures and osteoporosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption and maintaining bone density. Deficiency can lead to soft bones (osteomalacia) and contribute to osteoporosis, which increases fracture risk. Adults with low vitamin D may experience unexpected fractures even from minor falls or bumps. Maintaining adequate levels strengthens bones and reduces the likelihood of injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hair loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D influences hair follicle health and the hair growth cycle. Low vitamin D can slow hair regeneration, leading to thinning or hair loss. Conditions like alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder, are associated with low vitamin D levels, and treatments that include supplementation have shown improvement in hair regrowth. Adequate vitamin D ensures proper follicle function and healthy hair growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Depression and mood changes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D affects brain function and the regulation of neurotransmitters, which influence mood. Deficiency has been linked to a higher risk of depression and mood swings. Low levels can affect serotonin production, which may lead to feelings of sadness or lethargy. Restoring vitamin D levels may support emotional well-being alongside other therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D is associated with increased fat storage. Vitamin D is stored in fat cells, which can prevent it from circulating in the blood efficiently. People with obesity are more likely to have low blood levels of vitamin D. This deficiency can affect metabolism, potentially making weight management more challenging and contributing to further fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eczema and skin issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supports skin barrier function and immune response. A deficiency can worsen chronic skin conditions like eczema, leading to irritation, inflammation, and flare-ups. Adequate vitamin D helps regulate immune responses in the skin and improves its ability to repair and protect itself against environmental triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also see: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/too-little-or-too-much-of-this-common-vitamin-may-raise-cancer-risk-experts-find/articleshow/123658338.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Too little or too much of THIS common vitamin may raise cancer risk, experts find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slow wound healing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D plays a role in tissue repair and immunity. Low levels can delay the healing process for cuts, scrapes, or surgical wounds. Without sufficient vitamin D, immune cells are less effective at controlling infection and supporting tissue regeneration, making recovery slower and increasing the risk of complications. Adequate vitamin D intake also supports collagen formation, reduces inflammation, promotes faster wound closure, and enhances overall skin health, ensuring the body recovers efficiently from injuries while maintaining stronger immunity against pathogens. Vitamin D helps regulate calcium balance, supports cellular communication, and works synergistically with other nutrients like vitamin K to optimise healing and bone recovery. Regular sun exposure, fortified foods, and supplements can further boost vitamin D levels, enhancing recovery, preventing deficiencies, and supporting overall musculoskeletal and immune health. low vitamin D can also worsen chronic conditions, impact mood, weaken bones, and impair the body's ability to fight off everyday infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The rising number of people affected by this condition leads to multiple false beliefs about it which create confusion and potentially dangerous misunderstandings. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, recently took to his IG handle to bust 3 major myths about the condition. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 1: Fatty liver is caused by eating fat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People frequently believe that fatty liver disease develops because of consuming excessive fat in their diet. This is not true. Dr Sethi says that the main risk factors for developing fatty liver disease stem from consuming excessive amounts of sugary foods containing high fructose content, and unhealthy oils instead of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical research together with expert doctors demonstrate that the liver benefits from fats, which come from sources like extra virgin olive oil, avocados and nuts. The main reason liver fat accumulation occurs, is because of consuming excessive amounts of processed sugars together with unhealthy oils instead of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevention of sugar-rich foods and unhealthy oils takes precedence over fat avoidance in your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet that includes healthy fats serves as a method to support liver operation and maintain overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver diet: Best and worst foods for your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatty liver is harmless&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief that fatty liver disease presents no risk to health and does not need medical attention is completely incorrect. This is false. According to Dr Sethi, the progression of fatty liver disease remains hidden until it causes severe damage to the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive liver fat accumulation above 5% of liver weight, results in inflammation and scarring that can progress to liver failure when left untreated. The progression of NAFLD through NASH to fibrosis and cirrhosis, represents three dangerous stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of symptoms in people with fatty liver disease makes it difficult to detect the condition at an early stage. Research demonstrates that untreated fatty liver disease raises the chances of developing liver cancer and fatal liver disease stages. The detection of fatty liver disease at an early stage, requires immediate attention to diet and exercise for proper management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: Supplements serve as essential treatment for fatty liver&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi says that many people think supplements play a vital role in treating fatty liver disease, but this belief holds some inaccuracies. The primary treatment for fatty liver disease consists of diet and exercise, although some supplements including milk thistle, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E and N-acetylcysteine, show potential benefits for liver &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://liver.org.au/your-liver/liver-diseases/fatty-liver-disease/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that eating unprocessed foods and cutting back on sugary foods and unhealthy oils, leads to substantial liver health improvements. Physical exercise combined with weight reduction, helps patients eliminate liver fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements function best when used as part of a complete treatment plan, but they do not function as standalone solutions for fatty liver disease. Medical supervision becomes necessary when using supplements, because they can produce adverse effects and interact with prescribed medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention of fatty liver disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People

data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Healthy eating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet that includes

class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing a significant amount of weight can often seem like an overwhelming challenge, especially for busy professionals juggling demanding careers and personal commitments. Dr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sudhir-kumar" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sudhir Kumar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a neurologist from Hyderabad, experienced this struggle firsthand when his weight reached 100 kilograms. However, through steady, practical lifestyle changes, he managed to shed 30 kilograms over two years — a transformation that not only changed his physical appearance but also his overall health and confidence. Dr. Kumar’s journey, shared openly on social media, offers valuable insights and inspiration for anyone hoping to make lasting changes without resorting to extreme diets or grueling exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="4470428" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-journey" source="Orion"&gt;fitness journey&lt;/keyword&gt;: Overcoming &lt;keyword id="28749874" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-struggles" source="Orion"&gt;weight struggles&lt;/keyword&gt; amid a busy schedule revealed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting his fitness journey in late 2020, Dr. Kumar found himself trapped in a cycle that many people struggling with weight can relate to. His work as a neurologist demanded 16 to 17-hour days, leaving very little time for self-care. The long hours meant he often slept just 4 to 5 hours a night, which severely impacted his energy levels and metabolism. On top of this, his diet was far from ideal — frequent overeating, regular consumption of junk food, sugary snacks, and soft drinks added fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physically, the consequences were evident. Walking even five kilometers was a major challenge for him, and he experienced difficulty with stamina and endurance. It was clear that drastic changes were needed, but they had to fit into the reality of a busy medical professional’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How limiting work hours enabled Dr. Kumar to focus on &lt;keyword id="865258" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-and-nutrition" source="Orion"&gt;fitness and nutrition&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important changes Dr. Kumar made was to significantly reduce his working hours. By limiting his workday to 8-9 hours, he was able to reclaim precious time to focus on his health and well-being. This shift was crucial because it not only reduced stress but also allowed him to prioritize exercise and proper meal preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people underestimate the impact of work-life balance on health. Dr. Kumar’s example highlights how setting boundaries around work can directly contribute to better physical and mental wellness, making it easier to adopt and maintain healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How better sleep helped Dr. Kumar regulate appetite and boost metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cornerstone of Dr. Kumar’s transformation was improving his sleep quality. Increasing his nightly sleep to 7-8 hours was a game changer. Sleep plays a vital role in regulating the hormones that control hunger and fullness. Without adequate rest, the body tends to produce more ghrelin (which increases appetite) and less leptin (which signals fullness), making it harder to avoid overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sleep supports metabolic health, aids muscle recovery, and boosts mental clarity — all of which are essential for maintaining an active lifestyle and making good dietary choices. By prioritizing sleep, Dr. Kumar laid a solid foundation for sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How cutting refined carbs and increasing protein aids lasting weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to nutrition, Dr. Kumar took a balanced and realistic approach. He stopped drinking soft drinks altogether and cut down drastically on junk food and sugary treats, which are often major contributors to unwanted weight gain. Instead of following a fad diet, he focused on reducing his carbohydrate intake — especially refined carbs — while increasing the amount of protein he consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is known to help keep you feeling full longer and helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss. This thoughtful adjustment in his diet allowed Dr. Kumar to shed pounds without feeling deprived or hungry, making the changes sustainable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How consistent running helped him lose weight and improve his health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kumar didn’t rush into intense exercise. He started slow, walking five kilometers even though it was difficult at first. Over the course of several weeks, he gradually increased his distance to 10 kilometers, building endurance at a comfortable pace. Eventually, he transitioned into slow jogging and then running, focusing more on how long he stayed active rather than how fast he went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach helped him avoid injury and burnout. Later, in December 2022, he added strength training sessions three times a week, which helped build muscle, improve metabolism, and further enhance his body composition. The combination of aerobic activity and resistance training proved to be a winning formula for his sustained weight loss. Over time, Dr. Kumar’s dedication to running became apparent through the impressive distances he covered. In 2021, he averaged 15 kilometers per day, completed 339 runs of 10 kilometers or more, ran 69 half marathons, and even completed a full marathon. The following year, while slightly reducing his daily average to 12.6 kilometers, he still managed 304 runs of 10 kilometers or more, along with 43 half marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical transformation was impressive, but Dr. Kumar experienced benefits far beyond the number on the scale. Losing 30 kilograms brought a remarkable increase in energy and stamina. He reported feeling more focused and productive in both his professional and personal life. Alongside these changes, his self-confidence soared, reflecting the powerful impact of improved health on mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical tests showed improvements across the board. His resting heart rate dropped from 72 to an impressively low 40-42 beats per minute, indicating better cardiovascular fitness. Key health markers such as blood sugar levels (HbA1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure all improved, lowering his risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips from Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="2835833" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-loss-journey" source="Orion"&gt;weight loss journey&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Dr. Kumar stresses the importance of consistency. Showing up to exercise regularly matters more than pushing yourself to run faster or harder every day. He encourages people to focus on enjoying the activity and listening to their bodies instead of chasing personal bests or competing with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also highlights the value of cross-training — incorporating various forms of exercise to keep workouts interesting and reduce injury risk. Diet-wise, he advises mindful eating, suggesting that reducing overall calorie intake and possibly experimenting with time-restricted eating can be beneficial, though it should be tailored to individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he underlines the non-negotiable role of good sleep in any fitness journey, reminding us that 7-8 hours per night is essential for optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The information shared in this article is based on Dr. Sudhir Kumar’s personal health journey and is intended for informational and inspirational purposes only.

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of scientific investigations have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="173272" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may not be merely a condition of an aging brain, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;but the product of infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly emergence&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stomach-ulcer-bacteria-could-be-a-surprise-ally-against-alzheimers"&gt;Stomach Ulcer Bacteria Could Be a Surprise Ally Against Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing," &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324298"&gt;Dominy said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's important, because while &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg" alt="dentist checking x rays" class="wp-image-152675 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene?

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;An advocacy group known as Apex Citizens has called on Ghanaian authorities, particularly the Ministry of Communications, Digital Technology and Innovations, to take immediate action against “hookup apps.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The group alleges that these applications are being used by foreigners to expand the commercial sex trade within the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Peter Donkor, the group’s Public Relations Officer, stated that the influx of foreigners has not only affected local retail activities but has also led to a significant increase in prostitution. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He lamented that many of these foreigners are engaged in commercial sex work through these apps and urged authorities to act immediately.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Appearing on Rainbow Radio 87.5FM’s Frontline, Donkor directly appealed to the Ministry of Communications to address the issue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“These hookups are dangerous,” he said. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“They are being used to expand the sex trade in Ghana, especially by foreigners living here illegally.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He claimed that the apps are a major factor contributing to a surge in new HIV infections and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The use of technology has increased prostitution,” he asserted. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“The level of prostitution through these hookup apps is alarming and scarier than street prostitution.”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Donkor also called on landlords to be more vigilant and conduct thorough investigations before renting apartments to foreigners, many of whom he alleged are undocumented and engaging in criminal activities while living in Ghana.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“We cannot allow foreigners to destroy our country. Other countries have allowed foreigners to destroy theirs, but as Ghanaians, we cannot allow that to happen. While our focus is not only on Nigerians, they are the majority of foreigners here in Ghana,” he told host Kwabena Agyapong.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Carlos Akowah, the group’s Assistant Public Relations Officer, who accompanied M Donkor, added that foreigners who wish to reside in Ghana must follow established legal processes and obtain the necessary documentation. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He also reiterated that foreigners are restricted to wholesale trade and are not permitted to engage in retail activities.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Take a look at the arrests of suspected criminals paraded on TV and in the media and check the names. How many Ghanaians are involved in these crimes? The majority of them are foreigners. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
"They engage in robbery, kidnapping, scamming and killing residents. We are appealing to the Ghana Immigration Service to take immediate action and deport all undocumented foreigners,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But until scientists can deliver its gene-editing machinery safely and efficiently into relevant cells and tissues, that promise will remain out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Northwestern University chemists have unveiled a new type of nanostructure that dramatically improves CRISPR delivery and potentially extends its scope of utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called lipid nanoparticle spherical nucleic acids (LNP-SNAs), these tiny structures carry the full set of CRISPR editing tools -- Cas9 enzymes, guide RNA and a DNA repair template -- wrapped in a dense, protective shell of DNA. Not only does this DNA coating shield its cargo, but it also dictates which organs and tissues the LNP-SNAs travel to and makes it easier for them to enter cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lab tests across various human and animal cell types, the LNP-SNAs entered cells up to three times more effectively than the standard lipid particle delivery systems used for COVID-19 vaccines, caused far less toxicity and boosted gene-editing efficiency threefold. The new nanostructures also improved the success rate of precise DNA repairs by more than 60% compared to current methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published on Sept. 5 in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study paves the way for safer, more reliable genetic medicines and underscores the importance of how a nanomaterial's structure -- rather than its ingredients alone -- can determine its potency. This principle underlies structural nanomedicine, an emerging field pioneered by Northwestern's Chad A. Mirkin and his colleagues and pursued by hundreds of researchers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CRISPR is an incredibly powerful tool that could correct defects in genes to decrease susceptibility to disease and even eliminate disease itself," said Mirkin, who led the new study. "But it's difficult to get CRISPR into the cells and tissues that matter. Reaching and entering the right cells -- and the right places within those cells -- requires a minor miracle. By using SNAs to deliver the machinery required for gene editing, we aimed to maximize CRISPR's efficiency and expand the number of cell and tissue types that we can deliver it to."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nanotechnology and nanomedicine pioneer, Mirkin is the George B. Rathmann Professor of Chemistry at Northwestern's Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences; professor of chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering at the McCormick School of Engineering; professor of medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine; executive director of the International Institute for Nanotechnology; and a member of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR needs a ride&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CRISPR machinery reaches its target inside a cell, it can disable genes, fix mutations, add new functions and more. But CRISPR machinery cannot enter cells by itself. It always needs a delivery vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, scientists typically use viral vectors and lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to perform this function. Naturally good at sneaking into cells, viruses are efficient, but they can cause the human body to mount an immune response, leading to painful or even dangerous side effects. LNPs, on the other hand, are safer but inefficient. They tend to get stuck in endosomes, or compartments within the cell, where they cannot release their cargo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Only a fraction of the CRISPR machinery actually makes it into the cell and even a smaller fraction makes it all the way into the nucleus," Mirkin said. "Another strategy is to remove cells from the body, inject the CRISPR components and then put the cells back in. As you can imagine, that's extremely inefficient and impractical."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A DNA-wrapped taxi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome this barrier, Mirkin's team turned to SNAs, which are globular -- rather than linear -- forms of DNA and RNA previously invented in Mirkin's lab at Northwestern. The spherical genetic material surrounds a nanoparticle core, which can be packed with cargo. Roughly 50 nanometers in diameter, the tiny structures possess a proven ability to enter cells for targeted delivery. Seven SNA-based therapies are already in human clinical trials, including a Phase 2 clinical trial for Merkel cell carcinoma being developed by Flashpoint Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotechnology startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Mirkin's team started with an LNP core carrying the CRISPR machinery inside. Then, they decorated the particle's surface with a dense layer of short strands of DNA. Because the DNA can interact with a cell's surface receptors, cells easily absorb SNAs. The DNA also can be engineered with sequences that target specific cell types, making delivery more selective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Simple changes to the particle's structure can dramatically change how well a cell takes it up," Mirkin said. "The SNA architecture is recognized by almost all cell types, so cells actively take up the SNAs and rapidly internalize them."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boosted performance across the board&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After successfully synthesizing LNP-SNAs with CRISPR cargo, Mirkin and his team added them to cellular cultures, which included skin cells, white blood cells, human bone marrow stem cells and human kidney cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the team observed and measured several key factors: how efficiently the cells internalized the particles, whether the particles were toxic to cells and if the particles successfully delivered a gene. They also analyzed the cells' DNA to determine if CRISPR had made the desired gene edits. In every category, the system demonstrated its ability to successfully deliver CRISPR machinery and enable complex genetic modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Mirkin plans to further validate the system in multiple in vivo disease models. Because the platform is modular, researchers can adapt it for a wide range of systems and therapeutic applications. Northwestern biotechnology spin-out Flashpoint Therapeutics is commercializing the technology with the goal of rapidly moving it toward clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CRISPR could change the whole field of medicine," Mirkin said. "But how we design the delivery vehicle is just as important as the genetic tools themselves. By marrying two powerful biotechnologies -- CRISPR and SNAs -- we have created a strategy that could unlock CRISPR's full therapeutic potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, "A general genome editing strategy using CRISPR lipid nanoparticle spherical nucleic acids," was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (award number FA9550-22-1-0300), the National Science Foundation (award number DMR-2428112) and Edgar H. Bachrach through the Bachrach Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

The effect was particularly strong in people with diabetes and those under 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sweeteners, like aspartame and saccharin, were strongly associated with decline, while tagatose was not. While the study does not prove causation, it raises concerns about long-term brain health risks from common sugar substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Decline:&lt;/strong&gt; High sweetener consumers showed a 62% faster drop in cognition, equal to 1.6 years of aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diabetes Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were more pronounced in people with diabetes, who often use sweeteners as sugar alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not All Equal:&lt;/strong&gt; Tagatose showed no link, unlike other sweeteners tested.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some sugar substitutes may come with unexpected consequences for long-term brain health, according to a study published in the September 3, 2025, issue of &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined seven low- and no-calorie sweeteners and found that people who consumed the highest amounts experienced faster declines in thinking and memory skills compared to those who consumed the lowest amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link was even stronger in people with diabetes. While the study showed a link between the use of some artificial sweeteners and cognitive decline, it did not prove that they were a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artificial sweeteners examined in the study were aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame-K, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol and tagatose. These are mainly found in ultra-processed foods like flavored water, soda, energy drinks, yogurt and low-calorie desserts. Some are also used as a standalone sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Low- and no-calorie sweeteners are often seen as a healthy alternative to sugar, however our findings suggest certain sweeteners may have negative effects on brain health over time,” said study author Claudia Kimie Suemoto, MD, PhD, of the University of São Paulo in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 12,772 adults from across Brazil. The average age was 52, and participants were followed for an average of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed questionnaires about diet at the start of the study, detailing what they ate and drank over the past year. Researchers divided them into three groups based on the total amount of artificial sweeteners they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest group consumed an average of 20 milligrams per day (mg/day) and the highest group consumed an average of 191 mg/day. For aspartame, this amount is equivalent to one can of diet soda. Sorbitol had the highest consumption, with an average of 64 mg/day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were given cognitive tests at the start, middle and end of the study to track memory, language and thinking skills over time. The tests assessed areas such as verbal fluency, working memory, word recall and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for factors such as age, sex, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease, researchers found people who consumed the highest amount of sweeteners showed faster declines in overall thinking and memory skills than those who consumed the lowest amount, with a decline that was 62% faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the equivalent of about 1.6 years of aging. Those in the middle group had a decline that was 35% faster than the lowest group, equivalent to about 1.3 years of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers broke the results down by age, they found that people under the age of 60 who consumed the highest amounts of sweeteners showed faster declines in verbal fluency and overall cognition when compared to those who consumed the lowest amounts. They did not find links in people over 60. They also found that the link to faster cognitive decline was stronger in participants with diabetes than in those without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at individual sweeteners, consuming aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame-k, erythritol, sorbitol and xylitol was associated with a faster decline in overall cognition, particularly in memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found no link between the consumption of tagatose and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we found links to cognitive decline for middle-aged people both with and without diabetes, people with diabetes are more likely to use artificial sweeteners as sugar substitutes,” Suemoto said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed to confirm our findings and to investigate if other refined sugar alternatives, such as applesauce, honey, maple syrup or coconut sugar, may be effective alternatives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A limitation of the study was that not all artificial sweeteners were included. Also, diet information was reported by the participants, who may not have remembered accurately everything they ate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation, and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this cognitive decline and diet research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c4b6b0a1b7b7a9a5aa84a5a5aaeaa7aba9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Renee Tessman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aan.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Renee Tessman – AAN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Association Between Consumption of Low- and No-Calorie Artificial Sweeteners and Cognitive Decline: An 8-Year Prospective Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Claudia Kimie Suemoto et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Association Between Consumption of Low- and No-Calorie Artificial Sweeteners and Cognitive Decline: An 8-Year Prospective Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of low- and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCSs) has been associated with adverse health outcomes. However, little is known about the association between consumption of LNCSs and cognition. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between consumption of LNCSs and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a longitudinal observational study using data from civil servants aged 35+ years at baseline who were enrolled in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health and evaluated across 3 study waves (2008–10, 2012–14, and 2017–19).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with incomplete dietary data, extreme caloric intake (&amp;lt;1st percentile or &amp;gt;99th percentile), and incomplete data for cognitive tests and covariates at baseline were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to calculate combined and individual consumption of 7 LNCSs (aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame k, erythritol, xylitol, sorbitol, and tagatose). We estimated &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;-scores across 6 cognitive tests. The association of LNCSs with cognitive decline was evaluated using linear mixed-effects models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 12,772 participants (mean age 51.9 ± 9.0 years, 54.8% women, 43.2% Black/mixed race), the mean consumption of LNCSs was 92.1 ± 90.1 mg/d.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants aged younger than 60 years, consumption of combined LNCSs in the highest tertiles was associated with a faster decline in verbal fluency (second tertile: β = −0.016, 95% CI −0.040 to −0.008; third tertile: β = −0.040, 95% CI −0.064 to −0.016) and global cognition (second tertile: β = −0.008, 95% CI −0.024 to 0.008; third tertile: β = −0.024, 95% CI −0.040 to −0.008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no association between tertiles of LNCSs and cognitive decline in participants aged 60+ years. Consumption of aspartame, saccharin, acesulfame k, erythritol, sorbitol, and xylitol was associated with a faster decline in global cognition, particularly in memory and verbal fluency domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of combined LNCSs in the highest tertiles was associated with a faster decline in verbal fluency and global cognition in participants without diabetes and faster decline in memory and global cognition in participants with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumption of LNCSs was associated with an accelerated rate of cognitive decline during 8 years of follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest the possibility of long-term harm from LNCS consumption, particularly artificial LNCSs and sugar alcohols, on cognitive function. Study limitations include self-reported dietary data, selection bias from attrition, and residual confounding from co-occurring health behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 20:12:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPVDZldlFmWnFQT0ZmbDFXWU9JQlNYamxMNUJaXzhPNGxabXMwdkVoTlphNWMtRlFGajlqS294WWxnd0tqNm9ldDVva2R6REFBN0s4M3hLdTN6NDJ5QmktZjVDRDNDb09FV053TnA2T2hKbFViWGM2ZmtFT2x4QkxSbA</guid></item><item><title>欢快的音乐可以帮助人们克服车祸，新的研究节目-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheerful-music-could-help-people-get-over-car-sickness-new-study-shows/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to happy tunes helped study participants with motion sickness get over their predisposition and recover better, according to new research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motion sickness is a common condition that happens when you’re moving while sitting still, such as riding in a car. It occurs when our eyes, inner ear and body send conflicting messages to the brain, resulting in nausea, headaches, or breaking out in a cold sweat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Chinese scientists studying ways for improving the condition have &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1636109/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published a study in&lt;/a&gt; the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience showing that playing different types of music may help people recover more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a specially calibrated driving simulator, they induced car sickness in participants and then played different types of music while they tried to recover. Soft and joyful music produced the best recovery effects, while sad tunes were even less effective than doing nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Motion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,” &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/news/2025/09/03/happy-music-could-help-you-recover-from-motion-sickness-frontiers-human-neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said study author&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Qizong Yue of Southwest University in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Music represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers explained that feeling tense in anticipation of possible car sickness can trigger a physical reaction, bringing sickness on more quickly. Because music can be used to alleviate tension, Dr Yue and his team wondered if it could help people who get carsick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team began by developing a model to induce motion sickness. They recruited 40 participants to screen routes on a driving simulator and chose the most effective route for making people feel carsick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 people who reported moderate levels of previous carsickness then wore electroencephalogram (EEG) caps, to try to identify quantifiable signals of carsickness in the brain’s activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED SCIENCE&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Just 1-Minute Daily Exposure to Specific Sound Frequency Can Alleviate Motion Sickness: New Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/just-1-minute-daily-exposure-to-specific-sound-frequency-can-alleviate-motion-sickness/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Just 1-Minute Daily Exposure to Specific Sound Frequency Can Alleviate Motion Sickness: New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were divided into six groups – four that received a music intervention, one that received no music, and one whose simulators were stopped when they started to report that they might feel slightly carsick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last group acted as a comparative sample for the EEG data. They had received the same stimuli as the other 25 participants, but weren’t allowed to become nauseous, so the difference between their brain activity and the other participants’ would help identify signals characteristic of carsickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, the participants sat still in the simulator for a few minutes to capture EEG signals from their brains. Then they performed a driving task and reported their level of carsickness to the research team. Once they stopped driving, the participants in the music groups were played tunes for 60 seconds, and then asked to report how sick they felt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joyful music alleviated carsickness by 57%&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that joyful music alleviated carsickness the most, reducing it by 57.3%—followed very closely by soft music, at 56.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passionate music reduced motion sickness by 48.3%, while playing sad music turned out to be slightly worse than doing nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The control group reported a reduction of carsickness symptoms by 43.3% after their rest, while those who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOLISTIC SOLUTION TO MOTION SICKNESS:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="Woman Makes Drug-free Patches That Treat Nausea, Cramps, Vertigo, Hangovers – And Even Car Sick Pets" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/gopatch-drug-free-patches-for-nausea-and-cramps/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Woman Makes Drug-free Patches That Treat Nausea, Cramps, Vertigo, Hangovers – And Even Car Sick Pets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EEG data showed that participants’ brain activity in the occipital lobe changed when they reported carsickness, measureing less complex activity in this brain region when participants said they felt quite sick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better the said they felt as they recovered, the more the activity measured by the EEG returned to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Joyful or soft music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe it’s possible that soft music relaxes people, relieving the tension that exacerbates carsickness, while joyful music might distract people by activating brain reward systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sad music could have the opposite effect, by amplifying negative emotions and increasing overall discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KINDNESS IN THE END&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Caring Ambulance Workers Take Detour to Grant Dying Man’s Simple Ice Cream Wish" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/aussie-ambulance-workers-grant-dying-mans-ice-cream-wish/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Caring Ambulance Workers Take Detour to Grant Dying Man’s Simple Ice Cream Wish&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say further work with a larger sample size is needed to confirm the results. They plan to follow up the experiments with investigations of different forms of travel-sickness and the role played by personal musical taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,” said Dr. Yue, who believes the findings of this study would “likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel,” as well.&lt;/p&gt;

And managing those family bonds required more brainpower, which may have led to greater intelligence and teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some other animals couple up in similar ways to humans, most don’t, so love may be one of the missing links that helped us evolve from apes to us. But in order to persuade our less-evolved ancestors to share responsibilities (and food) with another person, love had to have some pretty huge benefits — like the nine listed here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;If two people are truly in love, they'll unlock these pretty awesome health perks:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.
