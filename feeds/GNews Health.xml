A 2025 clinical trial of over 20,000 participants found that people treated with another antiviral, molnupiravir, felt better, had fewer and milder symptoms, and took less time off work six months after infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AGI65XJZKNFCJOLGSKVF4FFI3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, once long covid has developed, antivirals have not been effective, with &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00073-8/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2819901" target="_blank"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; large randomized clinical trials finding no differences in outcomes compared with placebos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BOOA7CI55VEQ3GGVJWLL4YAV6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Instead, the strategy is to manage the symptoms — variable as they are — in each patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2YCXUO45Q5ERDMBNQMH4XL6XW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There is no “cookie-cutter protocol” for treating long covid, Ely said. “The best clinicians evaluate them head to toe and see what their story is and how they’re suffering.

            You’ve probably heard the stories: For every man who has cut carbs from his diet and dropped 10 pounds, there’s a woman who’s done exactly the same thing and lost 2. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40100584/" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; backs up this frustrating fact. Diet and exercise tend to benefit men much more than women when it comes to losing weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00042e6adrvw10y4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why the results of recent clinical trials were surprising — and welcome — for some: In study after study, injected GLP-1 weight loss medications appear to work better on average for women than they do for men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc8d3n00033b6mqsm17tl1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s not clear is why. And researchers say it’s important to understand so doctors can optimize the use of these powerful drugs for everyone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00052e6ao7pvpjeg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2416394" target="_blank"&gt;latest study&lt;/a&gt; to see this effect was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the European Congress on Obesity and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoi2h7600063b6m32il0nu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It was the first head-to-head comparison of the injectable GLP-1 medications semaglutide and tirzepatide, which are sold under the brand names Wegovy and Zepbound for weight loss. Roughly 750 people with obesity were randomly split into two groups. Half were assigned to get the maximum dose of Wegovy they could tolerate; the other half used the maximum dose of Zepbound.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc9zb900053b6mer5ijmoq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Zepbound is newer medication than Wegovy. It stimulates two different gut hormones that affect appetite and blood sugar, while Wegovy primarily affects the action of one.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00072e6ab9a92eds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors have observed that Zepbound seems to be a more powerful medication than Wegovy, so it was not surprising when this trial – which was sponsored by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of Zepbound – arrived at the same conclusion. People in the study who were using Zepbound lost about 50% more weight those who got Wegovy, making it the superior drug&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in terms of weight loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00082e6aadopkslk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One curious thing about the study was that all the participants lost a little bit less weight, on average, than has been measured with the same medications in other trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn00092e6af9vua676@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers say that result was driven by men, who lost about 6% less weight than women. About 35% of participants in this study were men, while 20% to 25% of participants in previous trials have been male.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000a2e6alfszdy69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Why this works better in women, I can’t honestly tell you, but it’s great,” said Dr. Louis Aronne, who directs the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine and who led the study. “It has been seen again and again.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000b2e6ay99ex51q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11271387/" target="_blank"&gt;long-term follow up&lt;/a&gt; of a trial that compared semaglutide to a placebo, women using semaglutide for two years lost an average of 11% of their starting weight, while men using the drug lost an average of 8%. Across &lt;a href="https://www.easd.org/media-centre/#!resources/b-body-weight-reduction-with-tirzepatide-by-sex-a-subgroup-analysis-of-the-surmount-clinical-trials-b-8475ab5a-d4b6-4545-b9c5-ad8b1c8a266e" target="_blank"&gt;trials of tirzepatide&lt;/a&gt; that compared it to a placebo, women on the drug lost up to 28% of their starting weight, while men lost up to 19% of their weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000c2e6abpypxpyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There could be a host of reasons for this, spanning numerous aspects of biology and culture, said Dr. Melanie Jay, an obesity expert and professor of medicine at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fnn000d2e6abzz464bd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first has to do with drug dosing. Women tend to weigh a little bit less than men but are prescribed the same doses, so it may be that they’re getting more for their size. “So maybe they’re getting a higher dose,” Jay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000e2e6avz82zumq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It might also have something to do with where women store fat. Jay said women tend to have more cutaneous fat, or fat under their skin, than visceral fat, or fat that’s packed around the internal organs like the liver. Perhaps the drugs are more effective on one type of fat than the other.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000f2e6abhrg32iw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Women also face more societal pressure to be thin, Jay said, and this could lead to greater motivation to stay on the medications, which aren’t always easy to take.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000g2e6af62rvj44@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jay said she’s seen this in her own practice. Women seem to be more willing to tolerate and work through the significant side effects of the drugs, which can include regular nausea, vomiting and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000h2e6aqjn0s081@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I have had a few more men be like, ‘I can’t take the constipation or the nausea,’ whereas the women usually figure out how to get through it,” Jay said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000i2e6aypgrg267@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the side effects tend to get better over time, as people learn how to eat differently and start to exercise more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000j2e6ajgnrgifu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the most intriguing clues to explain why women benefit more from the GLP-1 medications has to do with the hormone estrogen, which women have in higher amounts than men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000k2e6atiqif4hl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Karolina Skibicka is a professor of molecular medicine at the University of Gothenberg in Sweden and has a lab in the nutrition department at Penn State University. “Overall, I’m a neuroscientist interested in gut-brain communication,” which is how she began studying GLP-1, a gut hormone that also works in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000m2e6amvr8j3ui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Skibicka says scientists have known that estrogen plays a role in metabolism for about 30 years, but they didn’t really understand how. Her research in rats has shown that estrogen directly interacts with GLP-1 and other gut hormones, making them more potent in the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000o2e6au3wxlyj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several studies have shown that if you inject rats with GLP-1 and estrogen together, “you will see a very enhanced effect sort of across the board, on feeding behavior, motivated behavior, various other aspects of GLP-1 actions,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000p2e6acu65yl4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You can test this interaction in a another way, she said. If you block the action of estrogen with a chemical inhibitor, it turns down the effect of GLP-1, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000q2e6ai9ybkbr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If we take it away, the effect is reduced, so the animals will eat a little bit more now, or GLP-1 is just not as effective as suppressing feeding or suppressing food reward behavior, maybe more specifically, when we take away estrogen,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000r2e6abnybakm9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Estrogen appears to amplify the effects of GLP-1 by increasing the number of receptors — think of them as boat docks — on the surface of cells where this gut hormone can attach. In many tissues, she says, cells have receptors for both estrogen and GLP-1. “So then you sort of have an amplified effect inside the cell as well.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000s2e6acvyfg7bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although all of these theories are interesting, they are just educated guesses at this point.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000u2e6avg8bm40p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re really dealing with paucity of data compared to just sort of the baseline data that you have about what GLP-1 does,” Skibicka said. “Clinical studies don’t really ask and don’t really confirm why they see a difference.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000t2e6ay7od5e29@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Jay and Skibicka said sex differences typically go unexplored when it comes to drugs, and the GLP-1 medications are no exception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000v2e6ankn3wycf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In studies that do report data by sex, women may lose 50% to 90% more weight than men, but they also seem to report more GI side effects, Skibicka said. Men seem to get more cardiovascular benefits from the medications than women.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000w2e6a82emqtbw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although most studies don’t find that GLP-1 medications negatively affect mood,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;some have shown that this may differ by sex, with women being more likely to experience depression on the medications than men.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaoc5ikw00003b6mpf97ludf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Understanding the impacts of these sex differences could be important for all patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000x2e6aahuuph1n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If estrogen affects how strongly the medications work, that may have implications for the treatment of women before or after menopause&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;since estrogen levels fall in women as they age. It may also impact how well GLP-1 medications work for women on hormone-blocking therapies after breast cancer, for example. It may lead to strategies that help nonresponders, the people who don’t seem to lose weight on the drugs, and people who stop losing weight before they reach their weight loss goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000y2e6aqugxjdzo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Jay said that understanding the mechanisms behind the sex differences could help with adherence to the medications, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmao49fno000z2e6ajpbhma2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think those things are really important to know, because maybe there’s something else that we could give men alongside it that could enhance it … or we could change the dosing,” Jay said. “Men and women have different biologies, and we can’t treat them always the same.”

The scientific review analyzed data from 8,286,940 adults across 41 studies that looked at the link between ultra-processed foods and health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The researchers found a link between ultra-processed foods and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19177307/what-is-considered-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19177307/what-is-considered-high-blood-pressure/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="high blood pressure" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular events (like a heart attack), cancer, digestive diseases, and dying from any cause. Each extra 100 grams (3.5 ounces) a day  of ultra-processed foods was linked with a 14.5 percent higher risk of high blood pressure, 5.9 percent increased risk of cardiovascular events, 1.2 percent increased risk of cancer, 19.5 percent higher risk of digestive diseases and 2.6 percent higher risk of dying from any cause, according to the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There was also a link between eating ultra-processed foods and an increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and depression or anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Reducing ultra-processed foods intake, even modestly, may offer measurable health benefits,” study co-author Xiao Liu, MD, a cardiologist at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, China, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2025/05/08/14/10/Eating-Ultra-Processed-Foods-May-Harm-Your-Health" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.acc.org/About-ACC/Press-Releases/2025/05/08/14/10/Eating-Ultra-Processed-Foods-May-Harm-Your-Health" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="statement" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-did-the-brain-degeneration-study-find" data-node-id="13" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="13.0"&gt;What did the brain degeneration study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This study was published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="14.1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213562" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213562" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neurology" data-node-id="14.1.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and analyzed data from nearly 43,000 people with an average age of 48 who didn’t have Parkinson’s disease at the start of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The participants were followed for 26 years, during which time they completed regular medical exams, filled out food diaries, and answered health questionnaires. The researchers divided the participants into five groups based on how much ultra-processed foods they ate per day. They discovered that people who ate 11 or more servings of ultra-processed foods a day had a 2.5 times higher risk of having three or more early signs of Parkinson’s disease than those who had less than three servings a day. (Those early signs included things like rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, constipation, depressive symptoms, body pain, impaired color vision, excessive daytime sleepiness, and a reduced ability to smell.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's important to point out that what the researchers counted as a "serving" can really add up.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence"&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; is a broad term encompassing many different subtypes, from apps that can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/google-unveils-powerful-new-ai-said-to-out-think-chatgpt"&gt;write poetry&lt;/a&gt; to algorithms that are able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ai-combed-millions-of-images-of-the-arctic-it-found-an-alarming-pattern"&gt;spot patterns&lt;/a&gt; that would otherwise get missed – and now AI modeling has just played a major role in an  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="161108" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego) used AI to discover that a gene recognized as a sign of Alzheimer's disease could be causing it too. It highlights one of the big challenges in the study of Alzheimer's: understanding both the changes the disease causes, and the changes that cause the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enzyme called phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), and the gene that encodes it, were the focus here. The researchers had &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2022.02.008"&gt;previously established&lt;/a&gt; the gene was typically more active in people with faster-progressing Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161111" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161111" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic.jpg" alt="PHGDH graphic" class="wp-image-161111 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/PHGDHGraphic-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161111" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new study looked at the influence of the PHGDH gene. (Zhong lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What wasn't clear was what was driving this link. The team used AI to model the structure of the PHGDH enzyme more fully, suggesting it had a previously hidden function: flicking switches for other specific genes on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed PHGDH interacting with two genes inside brain cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrocyte"&gt;known as astrocytes&lt;/a&gt;, in ways that interfere with the brain's ability to regulate inflammation and clear out waste. The researchers think this could be one of the tipping points triggering Alzheimer's, and explaining the association between PHGDH and the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It really demanded modern AI to formulate the three-dimensional structure very precisely to make this discovery," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; bioengineer Sheng Zhong, from UC San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, the team investigated ways to inhibit PHGDH, but only partly – ideally, a drug would block its ability to regulate genes in astrocytes, while still allowing it to perform its vital enzymatic role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found a molecule called NCT-503 that fit the bill. AI modeling was deployed again to examine the structure of this molecule, and how it interacts with PHGDH. NCT-503 seems to bind to a pocket in PHGDH to stop its unauthorized gene-switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's still a long way to go before an actual Alzheimer's drug might be developed from this finding, but the research has shown that a treatment based on NCT-503 can put up guardrails around PHGDH in mouse models of the disease. The mice that were treated showed improvements in memory and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-is-linked-to-stress-and-depression-and-we-may-know-why"&gt;anxiety tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now there is a therapeutic candidate with demonstrated efficacy that has the potential of being further developed into clinical tests," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There may be entirely new classes of small molecules that can potentially be leveraged for development into future therapeutics."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crucially, NCT-503 is able to pass the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; to access neurons and their associated cells, making the new treatment research even more promising. Drugs based on the molecule could even be taken orally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it's taking time to unpick the complexities of Alzheimer's disease, and all the different factors involved in its development – from &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stressful-life-events-linked-to-alzheimers-biomarkers-study-finds"&gt;environmental stresses&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-risk-is-strongly-shaped-by-your-mothers-side-study-finds"&gt;inherited genetics&lt;/a&gt; – each new study gets us a step closer to solutions, and improving how we tackle the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately, treatment options for Alzheimer's disease are very limited," &lt;a href="https://today.ucsd.edu/story/ai-helps-unravel-a-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-and-identify-a-therapeutic-candidate"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhong. "And treatment responses are not outstanding at this moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.045"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

When these neurons were silenced in diabetic mice, blood sugar normalized for months, even without changes in weight or food intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges long-standing beliefs that obesity and insulin resistance are the sole drivers of diabetes.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These neurons are playing an outsized role in hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes,” said UW Medicine endocrinologist Dr. Michael Schwartz, corresponding author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if these neurons contribute to elevated blood sugar in diabetic mice, researchers employed a widely used viral genetics approach to make AgRP neurons express tetanus toxin, which prevents the neurons from communicating with other neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, this intervention normalized high blood sugar for months, despite having no effect on body weight or food consumption.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventional wisdom is that diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, stems from a combination of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors, including obesity, lack of physical activity and poor diet. This mix of factors leads to insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, scientists have traditionally thought the brain doesn’t play a role in type 2 diabetes, according to Schwartz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;he paper challenges this and is a “departure from the conventional wisdom of what causes diabetes,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings align with studies published by the same scientists showing that injection of a peptide called FGF1 directly into the brain also causes diabetes remission in mice. This effect was subsequently shown to involve sustained inhibition of AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the data suggest that, while these neurons are important for controlling blood sugar in diabetes, they don’t play a major role in causing obesity in these mice, the researchers noted in their report.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, targeting these neurons may not reverse obesity, even as it causes diabetes to go into remission, Schwartz explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed on how to regulate activity in these neurons, and how they become hyperactive in the first place, he said. Once these questions are answered, Schwartz said that a therapeutic approach might then be developed to calm them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could represent a shift in how clinicians understand and treat this chronic disease, Schwartz said.  He noted, for instance, that Ozempic and other new drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes are also able to inhibit AgRP neurons.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extent to which this effect contributes to the antidiabetic action of these drugs is unknown.

Convergent evidence implicates inhibition of a particular subset of neurons as a mediator of this FGF1 effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, AgRP neurons, which are located in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) and are hyperactive in Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice and other rodent models of T2D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether chronic AgRP neuron inactivation mimics the antidiabetic action of FGF1, we directed an adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing a cre-inducible tetanus toxin–GFP (TeTx-GFP) cassette (or cre-inducible AAV GFP control) to the ARC of obese, diabetic male Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice in which cre recombinase is expressed solely by AgRP neurons (Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; AgRP-Cre mice).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report that over a 10-wk period of observation, hyperglycemia was fully normalized by AgRP neuron inactivation. In contrast, changes in energy homeostasis parameters (food intake, energy expenditure, body weight, and fat mass) were not observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude that in diabetic male Lep&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ob/ob&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice, AgRP neuron hyperactivity is required for hyperglycemia but is dispensable for obesity.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 12:59:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5WYm5VajhKa08zVnZXZUhtcUNmcUZWaG50a2FLcWk4VGNkTUtrcGVlMGZtNGFXWkgwenB3RFNCWUV2RFdsNnFELVh3bFJ2ZDdLWVcyb3U4Yk9UZXJiOHgxR1hRWFFBQQ</guid></item><item><title>2025年世界高血压日：医生分享管理高血压的7个生活方式技巧-印度斯坦时报 | World Hypertension Day 2025: Doctor shares 7 lifestyle tips to manage high blood pressure - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/world-hypertension-day-2025-doctor-shares-7-lifestyle-tips-to-manage-high-blood-pressure-101747395296198.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is often called a silent killer, it can quietly pave the way for serious health issues, including heart disease and other chronic conditions.

Keep a healthy weight:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too much body weight overworks the heart and raises blood pressure. Try to have a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9. Reducing even a little weight can decrease blood pressure markedly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Follow a balanced diet:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopt the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. Eat fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy foods. Use less than 5 grams of salt daily. Cut back on saturated fats and processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Exercise daily:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be active for a minimum of 30 minutes every day, most days. Regular activity like brisk walking, cycling, swimming, or yoga maintains blood pressure at a healthy level. Exercise also lowers stress levels, another cause of hypertension. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/struggling-with-hypertension-this-new-kidney-based-treatment-could-be-a-gamechanger-101737210859592.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Struggling with hypertension?

Reduce alcohol and stop smoking:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heavy drinking can increase blood pressure and harm the heart. Smoking clogs arteries and puts more strain on the heart. Stopping smoking makes a significant impact on cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Manage stress:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-Managed Chronic stress is a cause of high blood pressure. Practice relaxation skills like deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness. Get enough sleep and maintain work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Check blood pressure often:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your readings in check, particularly if you have a family history. Use a home monitor or see a healthcare provider regularly for check-ups. Early detection is crucial to successful management. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/indian-lifestyle-and-hypertension-5-key-modifications-to-keep-blood-pressure-and-heart-health-in-check-101718954305989.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Managing hypertension in India: Adopt these 5 lifestyle tweaks for better heart health"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing hypertension in India: Adopt these 5 lifestyle tweaks for better heart health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7.

A new study overturns this long-held view, revealing that astrocytes—support cells long considered secondary—are the key intermediaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When norepinephrine is released in the brain, astrocytes detect it and release their own chemical messengers, dampening synaptic activity and reorganizing neuronal connections. Even when neurons can’t sense norepinephrine, these changes persist, as long as astrocytes remain responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrocyte Mediation:&lt;/strong&gt; Norepinephrine reorganizes brain activity through astrocytes, not neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Synaptic Dampening:&lt;/strong&gt; Astrocytes release a secondary signal that weakens synaptic connections in response to norepinephrine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting astrocytes may improve treatment of attention and mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;WUSTL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis have upended decades-old dogma of how connections between brain cells are rearranged during states of heightened vigilance or attention. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that a brain chemical associated with alertness, attention and learning alters brain connectivity and function not by acting directly on neurons, the cells known for their quick transmission of information, but through the work of astrocytes, another, slower-acting type of brain cell that is often overlooked in the field of neuroscience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery, published in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; May 15, fundamentally changes current understanding about the determinants of brain network communication and activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also calls for greater focus on astrocytes as therapeutic targets in the treatment of attention, memory and emotional disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Textbooks tell us that neuromodulators like norepinephrine fine-tune neurons directly — in fact, textbooks tell us that everything in the brain is about neurons,” said Thomas Papouin, PhD, assistant professor of neuroscience at WashU Medicine and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems that a lot of brain wiring and activity is probably orchestrated by astrocytes, on slower timescales. This is the type of discovery that profoundly reshapes our understanding of how the brain works.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the brain’s wallflower to center stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the brain to dedicate itself to tasks that need attention, or to respond to unexpected stimuli like a fire alarm, it needs to be able to rewire itself by changing how brain cells communicate. This process is driven by the release of chemicals known as neuromodulators, including norepinephrine, in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these neuromodulators reorganize communication in the brain is poorly understood. The assumption for the past 80 years has been that neuromodulator chemicals act on neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, for at least 30 years astrocytes have been shown to contact and interact with synapses, which are the specialized structures where neurons communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long suspected that astrocytes had the potential to rearrange communication between neurons and, therefore, the flow of information in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of their very fine and sprawling shape, these cells are ideally positioned to monitor and detect neuromodulators like norepinephrine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to test the idea that perhaps neuromodulation of synapses by norepinephrine is an astrocyte business,” Papouin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, Papouin and his team stimulated norepinephrine secretion from mouse brain cells or exposed mouse brain slices to norepinephrine and found that norepinephrine weakened connections between neurons, as known for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, researchers found that norepinephrine also triggered activity among surrounding astrocytes. Once triggered by norepinephrine, astrocytes produced a second chemical that they released onto synapses, which caused the dampening of synapse activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when neurons’ ability to directly sense norepinephrine was removed, norepinephrine was still able to rearrange neuronal connections. When astrocytes’ ability to sense or respond to norepinephrine were taken offline, on the other hand, norepinephrine was unable to reorganize neuronal connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings indicate that neuromodulators such as norepinephrine rearrange neuronal connections in the brain by signaling through astrocytes rather than directly onto neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also suggest that targeting astrocytes could be an effective way to reshape brain activity to potentially treat brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papouin’s team has started looking at existing drugs that are believed to act on neurons, to see if they require astrocytes to be effective. If so, perhaps astrocytes could be targeted directly for therapeutic purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are so many drugs out there that interfere with norepinephrine signaling in the brain, in particular in the treatment of ADHD or depression.

Instead, astrocytic adrenergic receptors and calcium dynamics fully gate the effect of NE on synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we found that NE suppression of synaptic strength results from an adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP)–derived and A1 adenosine receptor–mediated control of presynaptic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that astrocytes are a core component of neuromodulatory systems and the circuit effector through which NE produces network and behavioral adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 12:30:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBfY0M3MlByLTlINU9SVWNkamFvbEY3VG5KV0VGeGpaQWVfcUZaQWI5NEMyNlJHYWVDdGk1bGJQN1ZHWWpIVE9oMHlxOW5adjNZNEFPWVJQcVVtUDd6ck9DVnJWRlBjajNaYTVKbXB0aHRiTUxy</guid></item><item><title>专家说，鲜为人知的指尖变化是致命癌症正在上升的早期迹象-每日邮报 | Little-known change to your FINGERTIPS is an early sign of deadly cancer that's on the rise, experts say - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medics and campaigners have warned the public to pay attention to changes to their fingertips, as a specific alteration could be a red flag sign of lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-b86201f0-323d-11f0-85df-17851093755f"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Well-recognised signs of the deadly disease include a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14710921/non-smoker-lung-cancer-sign-shoulder-pain.html"&gt; persistent cough&lt;/a&gt; and breathlessness, but experts have now flagged a lesser-known, unusual symptom that affects the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Swelling in the fingertips, known medically as finger clubbing, is a known sign of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to be a result of a number of factors, including substances released by certain lung tumours that inflame the bones in the fingers, and harmful chemicals produced by the body that fuel cancer development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The problem can appear as swollen fingers, as well as a change in the shape of the nail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, a former patient whose only symptom was finger clubbing has warned others to be aware of the unusual sign and take action quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Go and see your doctor—that's what a GP is for,' Brian Gemmell, a fitness instructor from East Kilbride, Scotland, told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/lung-cancer-doctors-say-early-35229827"&gt;The Mirror&lt;/a&gt;. 'Go as soon as you can.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Gemell previously told The Roy Castle Lung Foundation that he suffered no cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Telltale signs of finger clubbing include softening of the nail, red and shiny skin around the nail and ridges along the length of it, according to Cancer Research UK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'I was feeling healthy,' he said. 'I wasn’t coughing up blood, I wasn’t breathless. My one and only symptom was clubbing of the fingers, where all your fingers swell up and when you put your fingers together you can’t see a diamond. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was my only symptom. Straightaway, my GP had an idea of what it was. He sent me straight for a chest X-ray and referred me to a respiratory consultant.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Gemell then underwent surgery and other treatment, and now lives with stage three lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his surgery he re-trained as a personal fitness instructor, working predominantly with cancer patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts recommend using an at-home screening tool known as a Schamroth window test to check for finger clubbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It involves pressing two opposing fingers back-to-back against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you can't see a diamond-shape window of light between the nail beds and the nails of the two fingers, this could be an indication of finger clubbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a 2012 &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3519022/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Dr Malay Sarkar, an India-based lung cancer specialist, lung cancer is the primary cause of clubbing, contributing to nearly 90 per cent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lung cancer is the third most common cancer in the UK with around 48,500 people diagnosed every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, he estimates that 5-15 per cent of people with lung cancer develop nail clubbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Sarkar's study, clubbing seems to occur in different stages, starting at the base of the nail, which becomes soft and spongy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It usually affects both hands, causing redness of the skin around the nail—known as erythema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The angle between the nail bed and the skin just below the cuticle then becomes noticeably bigger, causing the nail to curve more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, Dr Sarkar notes, the nail and the surrounding skin will look shiny and the nail will have ridges along the length of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, the finger develops a clubbed appearance. While the condition typically takes years to develop, it can happen quicker if there is certain complications such as a lung infection, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/mesothelioma/symptoms/finger-clubbing#:~:text=Finger%20clubbing%20can%20be%20a,ulcerative%20colitis%20and%20Crohn's%20disease."&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt; warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, extra areas of bone can form on the finger joints, wrists and even ankles—a condition which is known as hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA), and is often mistaken for arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of lung cancer are often not noticeable until the cancer has spread through the lungs, to other parts of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not everyone with finger clubbing will have lung cancer, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the charity advises those who think they may have it to contact their GP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The warning comes as Figures from Cancer Research UK show cases of all types of lung cancer have risen by 130 per cent in young women over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This makes them the fastest growing group at risk of the disease — although over-70s are still most likely to be diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, rates among men of the same age have barely budged from the early 90s, for reasons that medics say are simply unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have warned against viewing the deadliest form of cancer as a disease that predominately affects old people—as it has previously been seen—as cases rise among never-smokers worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, lung cancer in people who have never smoked is now the fifth highest cause of cancer deaths globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of the cancer include a persistent cough that doesn't go away after three weeks, repeated chest infections, coughing up blood, pain while breathing, persistent breathlessness and fatigue, and unexpected weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other, more unusual signs of lung cancer include change in the appearance of your fingers, difficulty or pain swallowing, wheezing, changes in your voice, and swelling of the face or neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 11:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我从小就忽略了致命脑癌的惊人迹象-现在我生活在刀刃上-每日邮报 | The surprising signs of my deadly brain cancer that I've ignored since childhood - now I live on a knife's edg - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQM1V5eUZkQldhTjFyMmtkMjY0RExOelNTYnYxb2NZT281Y2puTXRWb3BxX20yS213TkxyV0NPMU9zTmQxNmMxUElwZWtXeUVNejVHLXA4Q3BMNkxnVDN2Tkl0V1B2MFFsRnlscFlsQ1BzOXY5MGd0dHZISk95WWs4ZWNrSDZCNjE4YmhULXVibVQ5eGIzTzRWaHNvWFY3eUxpOGIwYlluRHNnUThP0gGyAUFVX3lxTE45UnZwMFFqcWlFQUE5Yzk3VzhQT3VSVDBlb1YwT1hLLXJaOUJUOF9OaDg1TnRHSERGVTVxbk1xb2lKWE1IbWQyVy1nM3g2NEZpcWlYcTc2S1d1QS1scmV0QzEtQ0JLSXVyZkF5bDlhSFpBZUJXcG5zWXBST05PT29SLTYyRm13Ri1oaVJlSDI1WnRHWnJkdURuekJTM3JlYXpZcmhhQmswNDdEZ0xpSnljSXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 20 year-old woman has revealed the subtle symptoms she ignored for more than a decade, which turned out to be signs of deadly brain &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-c72e9cc0-323d-11f0-ab12-8bae9bd0855c"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a viral &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-c7330990-323d-11f0-ab12-8bae9bd0855c"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;

To the point my family would always joke with me about it,' she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors said her repeated bouts of vomiting were caused by anxiety, she claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It turns out where the tumour at the back of my head, it was pressing against my brain stem and my "nausea center", causing me to throw up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Carson Fossat, 20, was only recently diagnosed with brain cancer despite suffering symptoms since childhoood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The symptom that had the biggest effect on her day to day life growing up was extreme exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was super fatigued. I was tired all the time.I would get more and more tired throughout the day and I would have to take naps,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was really hard for me to do school or work as I would have to nap for hours a day just to function.‘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘I also got a lot of headaches that I was also told was caused by anxiety. But they were pressure headaches at the back of my head, which is where the tumour was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was super dizzy all the time, when I stood up I would get super dizzy. I was told this was due to a lack of iron, as I had low iron levels.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The combination of symptoms meant she was ‘clumsy all the time’ and would often fall over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her long term symptoms and repeated trips to the doctor the tumour was only picked up after she was rushed to hospital following a car accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thankfully, brain surgery to remove the disease proved successful and her latest scans show no signs of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However she will have regular MRI’s for the next decade and is aware the cancer can return at any minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The regular scans mean 'it'll be caught early if it ever decideds to show up again,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If it ever comes back, I'll be ready.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recovery has not been easy, she told her social media followers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have really struggled to get back into normal life. I have discovered that I am immunocompromised and literally got sick from everything,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also had a hard time accepting that I wasn’t the same loud extroverted, outgoing girl that went into surgery.

Some patients obsess over thoughts that they might hurt someone, while others fixate on certain aspects of their personal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The comedian Maria Bamford, for example, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/20/magazine/the-weird-scary-and-ingenious-brain-of-maria-bamford.html" title=""&gt;called her O.C.D.&lt;/a&gt; “unwanted thoughts syndrome.” On “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” she shared a story about how she couldn’t stop thinking horrific thoughts about her family members. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On social media, people describe many types of obsessions and compulsions: “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kayleebullen/video/7391176157401517355?lang=en" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;relationship O.C.D.&lt;/a&gt;,” “sexual orientation O.C.D.” or “emotional contamination O.C.D.” These aren’t separate diagnoses, but rather they are different expressions of the same disorder — much like how people with phobias can suffer from different fears, said Dr. Carolyn Rodriguez, an O.C.D. expert and a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Understanding these distinctions can help clinicians tailor a precise treatment plan, she added.

But half of all babies with the disorder die in the first week of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia offered the Muldoons comfort care for their baby, a chance to forgo aggressive treatments in the face of a grim prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“We loved him, and we didn’t want him to be suffering,” Ms. Muldoon said.

			&lt;p&gt;A US infant with a rare condition has become history's first patient to be treated with a personalized gene-editing technique that raises hopes for other people with obscure illnesses, doctors said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wee pioneer is KJ Muldoon, now a 9-and-a-half-month-old boy with chubby cheeks and big blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after birth, he was diagnosed with a rare and serious condition called CPS1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is caused by a mutation in a gene that produces an enzyme key to liver function, and prevents people with it from eliminating certain kinds of toxic waste produced by their metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You Google 'CPS1 deficiency' and it's either fatality rate or liver transplant," the baby's mother, Nicole Muldoon, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQWWLErLaY&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; in a video released by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the baby was treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mUQWWLErLaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the prognosis grim, doctors suggested something that had never been done before: a personalized treatment to fix the baby's genome using what amounts to a pair of molecular scissors – the technique called Crispr-Cas9, which earned its creators the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boy's father said he and his wife faced an impossible decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our child is sick. We either have to get a liver transplant or give him this medicine that's never been given to anybody before, right?" said Kyle Muldoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161736" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-642x385.jpg" alt="A tiny newborn baby" class="size-medium wp-image-161736" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-642x385.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-692x415.jpg 692w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-768x461.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C-600x360.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/25-CHST-2545A7-MPR-CHOP-Stories-KJ-Patient-Story-chop.edu-2C.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161736" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;KJ was only days old when he was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disorder and transferred to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia where doctors were actively researching new cell and gene therapies.

&lt;p&gt;"The drug is really designed only for KJ, so the genetic variants that he has are specific to him. It's personalized medicine," &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a member of the medical team who specializes in pediatric genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161743" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-642x428.jpg" alt="World's First Patient Treated With Personalized CRISPR Gene-Editing Therapy" class="size-medium wp-image-161743" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/worlds-first-patient-t.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161743" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Patient KJ with Drs.

&lt;p&gt;The results were promising for other people with genetic conditions, said the medical team, which published their study Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJ can now follow a diet richer in proteins – his condition prohibited such before – and does not need as much medicine as he used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161732" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161732" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily.jpg" alt="KJ's parents, Kyle and Nicole, and his three siblings" class="size-full wp-image-161732" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/KJsFamily-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161732" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;KJ's parents, Kyle and Nicole, and his three siblings are looking forward to welcoming him home after a first-of-its-kind personalized gene editing therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Ahrens-Nicklas said she hoped this achievement will allow the boy to get by with little or no medication some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We hope he is the first of many to benefit from a methodology that can be scaled to fit an individual patient's needs," the doctor&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital"&gt; said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;© &lt;a href="terms-and-conditions"&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This micro-activity can break prolonged sitting and improve metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study Biotech &amp;amp; Health Tech Abroad: Top Courses at Harvard, Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researcher found that people who sat for 8 continuous hours had a drastic spike in their post-meal blood glucose and insulin levels. However, when this pattern was interrupted with just two minutes of light or moderate walking, every 20 to 30 minutes, their blood sugar levels dropped by 24-30% and insulin levels by 23-26% compared to prolonged sitting. These benefits occurred regardless of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/doctor-explains-what-happens-if-one-walks-for-1-minute-to-what-happens-when-one-walks-for-60-minutes/articleshow/121078389.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; intensity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means even a leisurely stroll can make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is clear. Sitting for long periods reduces muscle contractions and impairs glucose uptake, which leads to elevated blood sugar, insulin resistance, and inflammation. Regular movement reactivates these processes and helps the body to clear glucose and fats from the bloodstream more effectively. The study’s findings held true across body weight, sex, and baseline fitness levels. What makes the 2 per 20 rule so effective is its focus on movement frequency rather than intensity or calorie burn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a desk job, or a sedentary lifestyle, try the 2 per 20 sitting-walking rule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set a timer for every 20 to 30 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get up from your seat, refill your water bottle, or take a stroll&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure to walk for at least 2 to 3 minutes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When you are on the phone, walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can use a smartwatch or step counter to track your movement &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 05:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAJBVV95cUxOMlRObmpRaG42NmtkOERURlVhM0g4ZDhEN2lzbllEUzBYRmpDV0JwbGRCR3Vvb1hya2t4UDV0VV9XbXNmclc0QWFtWGdseWxWM2pndnJUbjhvV1VvQkFPUks0anR4QVdMNzUzc3psX285aWZBd05PV0hOU2JIQTMtOXNaSC1lUnBiRTNnaFRCYjBfRXhqMXd4cEZXZHI4bFVrbWVIdFZzWVp2ZFNiRFdmTmxNSkpjUE84a2MwVnAwSVVwMVd2Z3ZQZTFMUVV2aU1HMFEtemVrbEJOS0FQcTJBcExFdVJDU29xazN4VzIzUXZFOWtPeEh3azhVSU5Ma2lLR2Y1Sl81c0wtTTJhd1BqRnotZWI</guid></item><item><title>Trading Standards - BBC发布的鼻鞣喷雾警告 | Nasal tanning sprays warning issued by Trading Standards - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE4zV3VZWU1zUEszTWFuRkEyTWxUWUZ0QXdwYjd1RDR0MXZYa0dROGpQZktIODJzQ0dta2xzdi1VblNrd1BWVU1kX2ZKY3oxUWpSaHBPdzd5Ulg3Z9IBX0FVX3lxTE01YmdfaXgtdkk4RHFpMG42VzRRbFR2LVJ6VVF0T1pPV0VyWURJMlVWSnNBcFJLNlFIeGotVTdmZXkxazlnUnJmTkxiYTUya19NVmFWZEg3VUc0VWdEcXlB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Warning over 'unlicensed' nasal tanning sprays&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;William Higgens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Investigations, North West&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fdc3/live/8834d0b0-3176-11f0-8519-3b5a01ebe413.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Small bottles of nasal tanners.

Those who do may get a flu-like illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A small number of people infected with polio - between one in a thousand and one in a hundred - develop more serious problems that can lead to paralysis. This is also when the disease becomes life-threatening, particularly when paralysis affects muscles used for breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Papua New Guinea was said to be polio-free since 2000, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-44614382" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;until an outbreak in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which was contained within the same year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The latest cases were found to be carrying a virus strain genetically linked to one circulating in Indonesia. Papua New Guinea shares a border with Indonesia's easternmost Papua province. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health Minister Elias Kapavore has vowed to achieve 100% polio immunisation in the country by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There is no excuse... Polio is a serious disease," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The ongoing campaign will target children aged 10 and below and is expected to reach around 3.5 million people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The battle on polio starts today," the department wrote in a Facebook post yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The WHO, UN's children agency Unicef and Australia's government are supporting Papua New Guinea in its rollout of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Unicef's Papua New Guinea representative Veera Mendonca pointed out the disparity in vaccination coverage across the country - with coverage as low as 8% in some districts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That is not acceptable," she said, adding that Unicef is working with churches and community leaders to encourage vaccination and to dispel any misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Polio has staged a comeback elsewhere in Asia in recent years.

			&lt;p&gt;We're all aware of the psychological pain of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-world-s-loneliest-gannet-has-died-by-the-side-of-his-only-love"&gt;a broken heart&lt;/a&gt; – countless books, songs, and movies have been written and made on the topic – but there's also scientific evidence that a broken heart can be fatal too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technical term is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takotsubo_cardiomyopathy"&gt;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt; (TC), a weakening of the heart brought on by physical or emotional stress. A new study from researchers at the University of Arizona looked at data on 199,890 patients in the US between 2016 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Incidence of TC rose slightly over the study period for both males and females, but overall incidence was generally higher for females. Fatalities and complications caused by the condition were relatively high&lt;/span&gt;. This fits in with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2015.10.022"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; suggesting this 'broken heart syndrome' is becoming more common in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the condition was more common in women, deaths were more than twice as likely in men, with 11.2 percent of males dying compared with 5.5 percent of females. The overall death rate was 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were surprised to find that the death rate from takotsubo cardiomyopathy was relatively high without significant changes over the five-year study, and the rate of in-hospital complications also was elevated," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; interventional cardiologist M. Reza Movahed, from the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have put forward a hypothesis for the gap between men and women. TC is believed to be brought on by a surge of stress hormones, triggered by either physical or emotional stress – so a physical stress might be surgery or an infection, whereas emotional stress could be a divorce or the death of a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg" alt="Broken heart mortality rates" class="wp-image-161618 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/HeartCases-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161618" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mortality rates stayed high, but were higher for men. (Movahed et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical stress TC &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijcard.2011.11.027"&gt;is more common&lt;/a&gt; in men, which may explain the higher numbers of deaths brought on by the condition. The researchers also think differences in hormone balances between the sexes could play a role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications resulting from TC included congestive heart failure (35.9 percent of patients), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_fibrillation"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt; (20.7 percent), &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiogenic_shock"&gt;cardiogenic shock&lt;/a&gt; (6.6 percent), stroke (5.3 percent) and cardiac arrest (3.4 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is often marked down as a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; or chest pain, because of the similarity of the symptoms. But the researchers behind the new study are hoping to raise awareness of the condition, so that it can be better diagnosed and treated more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some complications, such as embolic stroke, may be preventable with an early initiation of anti-clotting medications in patients with a substantially weakened heart muscle or with an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation that increases the risk of stroke," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TC is something that health professionals have known about for a while, but there are still plenty of unanswered questions about the condition – both in how it might be detected and how the risk of complications could be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every case of TC is caused by relationship breakups, but it's clear that losing someone we love &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/yes-you-can-die-from-a-broken-heart-new-study-shows-how-damaging-losing-a-loved-one-really-is"&gt;has multiple consequences&lt;/a&gt; for our physical and mental health, and that the heart can sometimes take the brunt of the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The continued high death rate is alarming, suggesting that more research be done for better treatment and finding new therapeutic approaches to this condition," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/the-risk-of-death-or-complications-from-broken-heart-syndrome-was-high-from-2016-to-2020"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Movahed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, few things have inspired &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/online-wellness-content-3-ways-to-tell-evidence-based-health-information-from-pseudoscience-224119"&gt;as much quackery&lt;/a&gt; as the pills, potions and promises to slow ageing, boost vitality, or extend life. Yet, amid the hype and hollow claims, a few golden truths remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far back as 400 BC, Hippocrates, widely considered the father of modern medicine, famously said, "Walking is man's best medicine." More than two millennia later, science is finally catching up with that wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who walk more than 8,000 steps a day &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30211-4/fulltext"&gt;reduce their risk of premature death&lt;/a&gt; by half, compared to those who walk fewer than 5,000 steps – the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. But beyond 8,000 steps, the benefits tend to plateau, which challenges the long-held belief in the magic of 10,000 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that benchmark wasn't born of science, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/counting-every-step-you-take"&gt;but of marketing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42864061"&gt;10,000-step goal&lt;/a&gt; originated from a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q598"&gt;1960s Japanese advertising campaign&lt;/a&gt; for the world's first commercial pedometer called the &lt;em&gt;manpo-kei&lt;/em&gt;, which literally translates to "10,000 steps meter".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, researchers have been exploring a simple but important question: does every step count the same, or can walking faster – at a brisk pace of more than 100 steps a minute, or around three to four miles per hour – actually give you more health benefits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ageing and heart health there is mounting evidence that pace really matters. Simply converting a 14-minute daily stroll into a seven-minute brisk walk has been associated with a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae506"&gt;14% reduction in heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analysis of more than 450,000 adults in the UK used a genetic marker of biological age to reveal that by middle age, a lifetime of brisk walking reduces biological age by up to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-022-03323-x"&gt;16 years&lt;/a&gt; compared to a lifetime of slow walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study suggested it is never too late to benefit from brisk walking. An inactive 60-year woman or man was modelled to gain around an additional &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2024.100970"&gt;year of life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; through simply introducing a ten minute brisk walk into their daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of brisk walking can also be seen in its ability to predict future health outcomes. It has been shown to be a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319887281"&gt;stronger predictor&lt;/a&gt; of the risk of dying from heart disease than traditional predictors such as blood pressure and cholesterol, while also being a more powerful predictor than many other measures of lifestyle – including diet, obesity levels, and total physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, perhaps the single most informative question a doctor could ask their patient is: "How fast is your walking pace in comparison to other people?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Halo of benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But brisk walking may not provide additional benefits for all outcomes or in all contexts. For example, the benefit of brisk walking over light-intensity walking in lowering  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study suggested that although total walking was associated with reduction in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2024-109360"&gt;13 different types of cancers&lt;/a&gt;, there was no added value from brisk walking. Breaking prolonged sitting with light-intensity pottering around has also been shown to have profound impacts on metabolic effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, walking has a halo of benefits beyond physical health. It can help with brain activity, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0036577"&gt;doubling creative idea production&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the systems in the brain that support memory and imagination are also the same as those activated during whole body movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us already harness this very phenomenon, using walking to mull over problems and arrive at solutions or insights that would otherwise remain elusive. Context is also important here, with the mental health and cognitive benefits of walking thought to be enhanced when walking through nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So called "nature prescriptions" for clinical populations have harnessed these principles to increase walking activity and improving both mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h29z-l3XTlk?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical inactivity is a major driver of the modern  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt; of long-term conditions, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="161641" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease, that are now observed in industrialised and developing economies alike. It has been estimated that 3.9 million premature deaths could be averted annually through targeting physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of prevention, medical systems are largely based on management – people get ill and are then prescribed medicines to treat the illness. On average it takes $1 billion to bring a new drug to market which, despite these research and development costs, still go on to generate sizeable profits for shareholders showing the scale of the health economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If just a fraction of these costs were diverted into public health initiatives aimed at increasing walking and physical activity opportunities for all, the need for an ever more sophisticated medical management ecosphere may retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, when searching for the elixir of life, you could do worse than looking down at your feet.&lt;em&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255655/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/thomas-e-yates-2383889"&gt;Thomas E.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTLAND, Ore. — Multnomah County public health officials have confirmed one case of tuberculosis at Southeast Portland's Lane Middle School. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person had been recently diagnosed with active pulmonary tuberculosis but may have been contagious between Sept. 3, 2024, and May 1, 2025, exposing others, officials said. Those who have been potentially exposed have been contacted by the Multnomah County Health Department via an emailed letter. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;County officials added that there is little risk to the general public at this time and they are not aware of any cases connected to the infectious person. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portland Public Schools said that the Lane Middle School community can join a &lt;a href="http://meet.google.com/xsi-nntk-hqz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;virtual meeting&lt;/a&gt;, also being held in-person at the middle school, at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, May 20, for more information about testing, as well as potential testing locations and times.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those with &lt;a href="https://multco.us/news/faq-tuberculosis-exposure-and-steps-take" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;questions &lt;/a&gt;can call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406; the department will also be providing free blood tests to the school community in the coming weeks. Those doing a TB test with a personal health care provider should call the Multnomah County Health Department Tuberculosis Clinic at 503-988-3406.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fortunately, most people who have had casual contact with a person diagnosed with tuberculosis will not become infected,” said Multnomah County Health Officer Dr. Richard Bruno in a statement Thursday. “And most people who become infected will never become ill with tuberculosis, especially with current medication regimens. While tuberculosis can be spread in school settings, we expect that anyone infected would not yet be ill and could be effectively treated with medication.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county said it works with up to 30 tuberculous cases a year. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tuberculous&lt;/a&gt;, a bacteria that spreads through close face-to-face contact for several hours or daily contact through weeks or months, is curable with medication, but the infection progresses slowly, so it is important to be treated in order to prevent serious illness. Tuberculous is not spread by sharing clothing, dishes or drinking glasses, and it does not live on surfaces and is not spread through contact like shaking hands. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include coughing, chest pain and coughing up blood or phlegm; people with inactive TB do not have symptoms and cannot spread it to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Jason Speakman/MH Illustration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I decided I would try making overnight oats as a healthier breakfast option than sugary drinkable yogurt. I found the oats aisle and just stood there, attempting to make sense of the four dozen options in front of me, in every form, flavor, and level of added sugar. They all looked equally “processed” to me. I gave up, leaving the store without oats and with a heavy load of emotional exhaustion. And that’s just the oatmeal section of the grocery store, never mind the stacks of snacks, drinks, and condiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new supermarket anxiety plaguing Americans who want to eat healthier but aren’t quite sure how. By now, you’re likely aware of the overwhelming, still growing evidence of the health risks of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which links their overconsumption to a greater chance of premature death, as well as to plenty of its contributors: cognitive decline, dementia, depression and anxiety, several types of cancer, heart disease, inflammation, insulin resistance, and gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. Yeah, rough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s wild is that UPFs are a huge part of what we eat. The average American’s diet consists of about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001253" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:57 percent UPFs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;57 percent UPFs&lt;/a&gt;; that jumps to about two-thirds for children and teens. Maybe that’s not surprising when you consider that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-023-37457-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.menshealth.com%2Fhealth%2Fa64761295%2Fultra-processed-foods-why-they-are-bad%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:up to 73 percent of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;up to 73 percent of the U.S. food supply is ultra-processed&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study by a Harvard and Northeastern University research group led by Giulia Menichetti, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menichetti’s scientists are doing more than just counting UPFs. They and other researchers are also trying to make grocery store choices easier by tackling the surprisingly difficult task of figuring out exactly which UPFs are hurting us most and why. And they’re aiming to add nuance to the narrative that any UPF is bad for you. “Large population studies have begun to show that what is currently categorized as ultra-processed food may not be equally bad for our health,” Menichetti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where the Dangers of UPFs Are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what makes one package of anything better than another means decoding why UPFs are linked to so many major health problems. Researchers don’t quite know yet. In fact, there’s not even a clear, specific definition of “ultra-processed” that all scientists agree on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we’re not talking about is stuff like olive oil and frozen strawberries. Yes, these foods are processed, but oil pressing and flash freezing are considered minimal forms of processing, not ultra-processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition used by many researchers comes from the Nova classification system, developed by a team led by Brazilian scientist Carlos Monteiro, MD, PhD. Nova divides foods into four groups, from unprocessed or minimally processed to UPFs, which are foods made entirely or mostly from substances extracted from whole foods or synthesized in a laboratory. According to this system, UPFs are designed to be “hyper-palatable and attractive, with a long shelf-life.” Per one of Dr. Monteiro’s studies, they also tend to be “energy-dense, high in unhealthy types of fat, refined starches, free sugars and salt, and poor sources of protein, dietary fiber, and micronutrients.” So that would include cookies, sweet yogurts, energy drinks, instant soups, and food “nuggets.” Some critics say Nova puts too much weight on the number of ingredients in a product and the number of processes it goes through. Under its terms, some healthful homemade foods would be considered processed, such as hummus made from canned beans or made-from-scratch bread. Still, Nova is often used in studying exactly why UPFs do a number on your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How UPFs Affect Us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no shortage of really interesting and compelling-sounding theories about how ultra-processed food might impact human health,” says Kevin Hall, PhD, who’s doing dietary intervention studies on UPFs at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effect is straightforward: “They make people eat more,” says Marion Nestle, PhD, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University. Hall saw this in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7946062/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:groundbreaking 2019 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;groundbreaking 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; in which 20 people spent two weeks eating a diet of 81 percent UPFs. They then spent another two weeks eating a diet with the same amount of protein, fat, and carbs but from non-UPF foods. On both diets, they could eat as little or as much as they wanted. Given that the nutrient distribution was the same, Hall didn’t expect to see a big difference—but he proved himself wrong. On the UPF diet, people ate about 500 more calories a day and, unsurprisingly, gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think it’s obvious that people overeat UPFs because their fat, sugar, and sodium content makes them taste really good. Those extra calories can lead to obesity, which contributes to most of the health issues linked to UPFs, Nestle says. But other researchers think that answer is too simplistic and suggest it may be that the body absorbs UPFs so quickly that they don’t make us feel full. Or that these foods lack the fiber your microbiome needs to help manage your health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that processing itself can change a food in unexpected ways. Anthony Fardet, PhD, a food scientist at France’s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, cites a theory that xenobiotics, or synthetic chemicals, might be damaging. These could be lab-made additives, or even compounds leached from packaging into the food itself. Either way, xenobiotics don’t exist in nature, he says, and we don’t know how they affect our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emulsifiers are coming under scrutiny as well. These are substances designed to stabilize UPFs by holding together two liquids, usually oil and water. Emerging research in top journals such as Gastroenterology indicates that some of these, such as polysorbate-80 (used in foods like ice cream) and the texture modifier carboxymethylcellulose (which could be in anything from sausages to baked goods to candy), can lead to inflammation in the gut. This could prevent adequate nutrient absorption and damage your metabolism. Other emulsifiers may be harmless; some may combine to cause trouble. So, it’s complicated. “The idea is to start looking at foods not only by considering one chemical at a time, one nutrient at a time, but by looking at how these different chemicals influence each other and how the overall profile of chemicals determines the quality of food,” Menichetti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know this is a lot. And so do the scientists, who are only in the early stages of unpacking what makes UPFs so damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are you supposed to do while researchers figure it out? Tech tools might help a bit (see below). But when you’ve got to go packaged, at least aim to offset the effects we know about so far:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Pick the products that are lowest in added sugar—since added sugars are often a big sign of a less-healthy UPF. Same with sugar alcohols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Find ways to add omega-3s to your diet. A high-UPF diet generally doesn’t include much of these. Try having a meal with salmon or tuna each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Load up on fiber, since a high-UPF diet can leave you lacking here. Make an effort: Your goal should be 30 to 38 grams a day, ideally from a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Determine whether some of the foods you consume are actually increasing your hunger or your desire to eat. Consider tracking what you eat for a week. Do you notice that you eat more on certain days with certain types of foods? If you can identify which are more addictive for you, focus on alternatives to those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menichetti and her team want to make all of this easier by diving into the thicket of details so you don’t have to—so they’ve started a database, TrueFood, to help. And they’re also wishing that the food industry had better labeling and, ideally, better foods. Nestle echoes that, saying that better regulations could force the food industry to make healthier products. People trying to eat better are “fighting the entire food system on their own,” she says. “That’s really hard to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Eventually, when I’m in the oats aisle, I’ll have great tools to help me. In the meantime, I’ll use the strategies on the left and try to choose as many foods as I can that look as close as possible to, well, food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;True Food&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Photo credit: True Food&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.truefood.tech/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; analyzes a product’s ingredients and spits out a score from 0 to 100, indicating how highly processed that food is likely to be.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that moderate amounts of zinc can help slow down aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Researchers found that adding exercise may enhance the effects of zinc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s worth noting that too much zinc can increase the speed of aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many of us are continually looking for ways to slow down or reverse aging, and one thing that makes us age more quickly is inflammation. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-diet-linked-with-lower-risk-of-cognitive-impairment-8641170" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;we previously reported&lt;/a&gt; on research that suggests that an anti-inflammatory diet may reduce the risk of cognitive impairment—brain aging—by 21%. And another study suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-aging-study-11731249" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating more antioxidant-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;—which are anti-inflammatory—may help you live longer with a higher quality of life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of these anti-inflammatory nutrients is zinc, an essential trace mineral that you must get from food or supplements since the body does not make it on its own. While you don’t need a lot of zinc each day, this antioxidant-acting mineral plays an important role in supporting DNA, wound healing and immunity—all things that influence aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists have jumped on the anti-aging bandwagon, not just to prevent it, but to measure it. Tools that use algorithms to determine people’s biological age are now available and often used in studies. Biological age is defined as the chronological age-dependent decline of biological functions, characterized by 12 biomarkers that fall under three categories that can be measured with bloodwork. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, while chronological age is how old you are in years from birth to now, biological age is the speed at which your body is aging. For example, a 48-year-old woman’s biological aging may be keeping pace with her chronological age—or it could be aging more slowly or faster than an average 48-year-old woman. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from China wanted to know more about the role of zinc in biological aging, plus how exercise might modify zinc’s effect on aging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They recently published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break them down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Data was pulled from the UK Biobank, a long-term study that contains medical and lifestyle information on over 500,000 UK residents. For this current study, researchers drew data on almost 69,000 people who met their criteria, which included having sufficient information on diet, physical activity and biomarkers to calculate biological age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants were divided into two groups: one group without zinc intake and one with it. The group without zinc included over 35,000 people with an average age of 56; 46% were female. The zinc group included over 33,000 people with an average age of 56; about 65% were female.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Zinc intake was calculated based on participants’ food records and responses to questions about supplements. Participants’ zinc intake amounts were compared against the daily recommended intake of 11 mg per day for male participants and at least 8 mg per day for female participants, with neither going over 40 mg per day. Over 40 mg/day is considered zinc overdose for both males and females.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The exercise amount was calculated based on standard questionnaires regarding physical activity and was transposed into metabolic equivalent of task (MET). The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least 600 MET per week, which is equivalent to at least 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week or 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Biological aging was calculated using the ENABL Age tool, which, according to these researchers, is the most up-to-date estimation tool for distinguishing healthy aging from unhealthy aging, and for predicting mortality for 5- and 10-year mortality markers.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Confounding factors that affect biological aging and would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included sex, ethnicity group, BMI, family income, sleep disorders, smoking status, alcohol intake and history of cancer diagnosis. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-show"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Show? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study suggests that participants with delayed biological aging—meaning they’re aging more slowly—tend to have higher levels of daily zinc intake compared to participants with accelerated aging. Specifically, those who got the recommended amount of zinc each day showed an average delay of 0.11 years in biological aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, as with most things, more is not necessarily better, as those with zinc intakes over the recommended limit of 40 mg/day showed an acceleration of almost 7 years in biological aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The analysis that included exercise suggests that participants with the recommended dose of zinc intake plus the recommended amount of physical activity had 31% decreased odds of having biological aging acceleration compared to participants with inadequate zinc intake and inadequate physical activity. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some limitations of this study include the narrow population, since the UK Biobank is mostly made up of white people of European descent. The nature of this observational study cannot conclude causation; in other words, researchers cannot say that zinc causes slower aging, just that it’s associated with it. Also, diet and physical activity information was self-reported, which always leaves room for error and bias.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-relate-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Relate to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to these researchers, insufficient zinc intake affects approximately 17% of people around the globe, and for this reason, they state that zinc supplements may be useful for some. However, this also comes with caution, as too much zinc speeds up aging—by a lot. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers aren’t exactly sure why zinc seems to slow aging, but they know that zinc influences age-related processes, including DNA synthesis, protein metabolism, cell proliferation (generating new cells) and mitosis (cell replication). Zinc has also been linked with bone health, immunity support, healthy hormones and the prevention of nervous system diseases, like Alzheimer’s. It also acts like an antioxidant, reducing inflammation, researchers add. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-inflammation-ages-you-8744048" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;less inflammation means slower aging&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking to eat your zinc, aim for sources like seafood, meat, poultry, dairy, nuts and seeds. Both our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-high-protein-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-8777942" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;30-Day High-Protein Meal Plan for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-healthy-aging-11711460" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;30-Day Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt; contain plenty of healthy-aging foods, including those high in zinc. If you need more guidance to ensure you’re eating for healthy aging, make an appointment with a registered dietitian to help you design a plan based on your needs, lifestyle and preferences. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study also included the role of physical activity, noting that when combined with sufficient zinc intake, aging was slowed even further. The study didn’t differentiate between types of exercise—like cardio versus strength training—just that participants were meeting minimal guidelines. If you’re currently not physically active, just start moving more throughout the day and be intentional about it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For example, do more trips into the house from the car with groceries, or up and down the stairs when putting laundry away. Take frequent breaks throughout the day to stretch, do a set of squats or walk a lap around the house. Over time, gradually increase the amount until you’re more closely meeting the minimum recommendation of 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study suggests that adequate zinc intake can slow biological aging, even more so when combined with exercise. But researchers also found that too much zinc was associated with much faster biological aging. Consider assessing which foods you’re currently eating that provide zinc. If you think you’re not getting enough, choose which foods to add. But before supplementing with zinc, meet with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian to make sure you don’t get more of it than your body needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t go breaking my heart.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a loved one passes on and your heart aches — there’s a name for that, and apparently, men are more likely to die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technical term for “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/laughter-can-heal-a-broken-heart-literally-cardiac-health-study/"&gt;broken heart&lt;/a&gt; syndrome” is takotsubo cardiomyopathy — and people are diagnosed with it when stress hormones like adrenaline prevent their hearts from properly contracting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a serious condition brought on by very stressful situations and extreme emotions that doctors don’t take lightly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While women are known to more often suffer from the syndrome — men are the ones actually dying from it at more than twice the rate, according to a new study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.037219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting point the study made is that &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/28/laughter-can-heal-a-broken-heart-literally-cardiac-health-study/"&gt;broken heart&lt;/a&gt; syndrome is “triggered by emotional stress, predominantly in women, or physical stress, predominantly in men.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;To come to this conclusion, researchers observed almost 2,000 patients older than 18-years-old diagnosed with the condition from 2016 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study found that the mortality rate of brokenhearted men was a staggering 11.2% compared to only 5.5% of the female patients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers reportedly concluded that those who died most likely suffered complications from the condition, like irregular heartbeat, cardiac arrest, congestive heart failure and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The study found that the mortality rate of brokenhearted men was a staggering 11.2% compared to only 5.5% of the female patients.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Men may be more at risk for dying and having bad outcomes because they’re less susceptible to begin with,” Dr. Ilan Wittstein, a cardiologist at Johns Hopkins Medicine, told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/men-are-likely-die-broken-heart-syndrome-study-says-rcna206276" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“So it takes a more dangerous trigger to precipitate the syndrome.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to keep in mind that just because you’re feeling blue over something doesn’t necessarily mean you have the condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Wittstein, those with underlying health issues, especially relating to the heart — like high blood pressure or high cholesterol — are more susceptible to takotsubo cardiomyopathy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, there isn’t any treatment or medication for it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In certain situations, doctors will prescribe patients medicine used to treat other heart conditions, but that’s on a case-by-case basis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to it, experts advise people to seek medical attention if they’re feeling unusual chest pains or symptoms — and to manage stress levels, which can be challenging in this day and age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As we advance in age and take on more life and work responsibilities, we experience higher stress levels,” Dr. Susan Cheng &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2021/10/13/broken-heart-syndrome-is-on-the-rise-especially-among-older-women" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;told American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And with increasing digitization around every aspect of our lives, environmental stressors have also intensified.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Aside from lowering stress levels, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/13/health/just-3-days-of-this-bad-habit-can-increase-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;getting sufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; is another way people can lower their risk of developing heart-related issues, according to another &lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/en/press/press-releases/2025/2025-05-08-lack-of-sleep-can-increase-the-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we have improved our understanding of what role the amount of sleep we get plays in cardiovascular health,” Cedernaes said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s important to point out that studies have also shown that physical exercise can offset at least some of the negative effects that poor sleep can cause,” he added. “But it’s also important to note that exercise cannot replace the essential functions of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s recommended for adults to get seven to nine hours of sleep a night — so there’s another reason why you should put away your phone to get a good night’s snooze. &lt;/p&gt;

Using fMRI data from over 1,500 healthy participants, researchers found that sensory input, regardless of the type, engages the midbrain reticular formation and central thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas are crucial for regulating alertness, attention, and awareness. The surprising discovery highlights a shared subcortical network for sensory attention, deepening our understanding of how consciousness is organized in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shared Brain Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; All senses activated the same deep brain regions when participants paid close attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Activity in the midbrain and thalamus was strongest during tasks requiring sharp focus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The results could lead to better treatments for ADHD and consciousness disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans perceive and navigate the world around us with the help of our five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while scientists have long known that these different senses activate different parts of the brain, a new Yale-led study indicates that multiple senses all stimulate a critical region deep in the brain that controls consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109996"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/senses-consciousness-attention-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published May 15 in the journal &lt;em&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/em&gt;, sheds new light on how sensory perception works in the brain and may fuel the development of therapies to treat disorders involving attention, arousal, and consciousness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, a research team led by Yale’s Aya Khalaf focused on the workings of subcortical arousal systems, brain structure networks that play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies on patients with disorders of consciousness — such as coma or epilepsy — have confirmed the influence of these systems on states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prior research has been largely limited to tracking individual senses. For the new study, researchers asked if stimuli from multiple senses share the same subcortical arousal networks. They also looked at how shifts in a subject’s attention might affect these networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) datasets collected from 1,561 healthy adult participants as they performed 11 different tasks using four senses: vision, audition, taste, and touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They made two important discoveries: that sensory input &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; make use of shared subcortical systems and, more surprisingly, that all input — regardless of which sense delivered the signal — stimulates activity in two deep brain regions, the midbrain reticular formation and the central thalamus, when a subject is sharply focused on the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were expecting to find activity on shared networks, but when we saw all the senses light up the same central brain regions while a test subject was focusing, it was really astonishing,” said Khalaf, a postdoctoral associate in neurology at Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery highlighted how key these central brain regions are in regulating not only disorders of consciousness, but also conditions that impact attention and focus, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding could lead to better targeted medications and brain stimulation techniques for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has also given us insights into how things work normally in the brain,” said senior author Hal Blumenfeld, the Mark Loughridge and Michele Williams Professor of Neurology who is also a professor in neuroscience and neurosurgery and director of the Yale Clinical Neuroscience Imaging Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a step forward in our understanding of awareness and consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking across senses, this is the first time researchers have seen a result like this, said Khalaf, who is also part of Blumenfeld’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It tells us how important this brain region is and what it could mean in efforts to restore consciousness,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors include Erick Lopez, a former undergraduate researcher in Blumenfeld’s lab, and collaborators from Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported in part by funding from the National Institutes of

across sensory modalities during transient modulation of attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subcortical arousal systems are known to play a key role in controlling sustained changes in attention and conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies indicate that these systems have a major influence on short-term dynamic modulation of visual attention, but their role across sensory modalities is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated shared subcortical arousal systems across sensory modalities during transient changes in attention using block and event-related fMRI paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed massive publicly available fMRI datasets collected while 1561 participants performed visual, auditory, tactile, and taste perception tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analyses revealed a shared circuit of subcortical arousal systems exhibiting early transient increases in activity in midbrain reticular formation and central thalamus across perceptual modalities, as well as less consistent increases in pons, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these networks is critical for understanding mechanisms of normal attention and consciousness and may help facilitate subcortical targeting for therapeutic neuromodulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Carriers of recessive gene mutations, long thought to be unaffected, may actually face subtle disadvantages, including more medical issues, shorter educational attainment, and reduced reproductive success. A study of over 300,000 individuals reveals that people who carry recessive genes for intellectual disability are especially impacted, despite having only one mutated gene copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These carriers were more likely to be childless and had shorter school careers, suggesting evolutionary selection pressures still act on these seemingly silent genes. The findings challenge textbook assumptions and offer new insights into how natural and sexual selection may still shape the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Carriers of recessive disease genes show more medical diagnoses and slightly lower reproductive success.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Carriers of intellectual disability genes attend school for fewer years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduced reproductive success may result from subtle effects that influence mate choice and social outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Radboud University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a group, carriers of recessive disorders are slightly less healthy and have a reduced chance of having offspring. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This disadvantage is greatest for carriers of a recessive gene for intellectual disability, and reflected in a shorter school career and increased childlessness, according to research from Radboudumc published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to rewrite the textbooks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominant mutation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Radboudumc, Department of Human Genetics, demonstrated something remarkable in a 2014 publication in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations, inherited variants in genes were rarely responsible for intellectual disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vast majority, the disability arose from a spontaneous mutation: a mutation that neither parent has, but suddenly appears in the child. It is a biological fact that about one hundred spontaneous mutations occur in the hereditary material of each child. Mutations that therefore do not originate from the parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, only one of these one hundred mutations affects a gene. And only a fraction of those affects one of the hundreds of genes that can cause intellectual disability. But rare events still happen. Most intellectual disabilities arise in this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From dominant to recessive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was something else going on,” said Christian Gilissen, professor of Genome Bioinformatics and first author of the 2014 article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children receive a gene from both father and mother by default. When a single mutation in the child leads to intellectual disability, this is called a mutation in a &lt;em&gt;dominant gene&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other mutations affect &lt;em&gt;recessive genes&lt;/em&gt;. Having a single mutation in a recessive gene, in principle, has no effect on the carrier. A handicap only arises if the mutation is in both copies of the recessive gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our clinic we found very few of these double mutations in recessive genes in children with intellectual disabilities. Strange, because there are more recessive than dominant genes for this. So we wondered: where did all those recessive mutations go?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More medical diagnoses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question led to a long and extensive search, the results of which have now been published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We first investigated how often these recessive mutations occur in the population,” says Han Brunner professor of clinical genetics and, like Gilissen, involved in both publications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, the data of more than 300,000 people included in the UK Biobank were examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that each person carries on average two mutations in any one of 1,900 recessive genes. According to textbooks, carriers of such recessive genes should not experience any disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we found that, as a group, they do have more medical diagnoses, and slightly less offspring. Thus, they are less likely to pass on their genes for recessive disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to other recessive genes, genes for intellectual disability were the most absent. Apparently, there is another aspect at play here. The UK Biobank data provide a clue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilissen: “Carriers of a recessive gene for intellectual disability go to school for a shorter time, which suggests that they have a lower level of education. Mind you, these are carriers, according to existing theory, are not affected at all by their recessive gene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More likely to be childless&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, carriers of recessive genes for intellectual disability have reduced reproductive success and a shorter school career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brunner: “In 1859, Darwin published &lt;em&gt;On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection&lt;/em&gt;. It was mainly about survival, about genes that make you strong and healthy, about natural selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Twelve years later he wrote &lt;em&gt;The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex&lt;/em&gt;, in which he refined his theory. You can have fine genes, but if no one wants to have children with you, those genes will not be passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The principle of sexual selection. We’re not demonstrating it rock solid here, but if I had to give a cause for these findings – based in part on a lot of sociological research – sexual selection is the most obvious explanation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rewriting textbooks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research clearly shows that recessive carriers of diseases have a selection disadvantage at the group level. In the past, this has been pointed out for specific disorders. Here, for the first time this is demonstrated for recessive disorders in general. That may go into the textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brunner: “Our research indicates that our genes are still constantly changing, that the genetic landscape remains in motion, that evolution continues. The idea that in our modern age evolution has come to a creaking halt thanks to health care and other amenities is not true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor will it ever be, Gilissen suggests: “We will never be optimized for tomorrow’s problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this evolutionary neuroscience and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7f0f161a0b1a0d511310121e110c3f0d1e1b1d100a1b0a121c511113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Pieter Lomans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://radboudumc.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Radboud University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Pieter Lomans – Radboud University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02204-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Reproductive and cognitive phenotypes in carriers of recessive pathogenic variants&lt;/a&gt;” by Christian Gilissen et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reproductive and cognitive phenotypes in carriers of recessive pathogenic variants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The genetic landscape of human Mendelian diseases is shaped by mutation and selection. Although selection on heterozygotes is well-established in autosomal-dominant disorders, convincing evidence for selection in carriers of pathogenic variants associated with recessive conditions is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we studied heterozygous pathogenic variants in 1,929 genes, which cause recessive diseases when bi-allelic, in &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 378,751 unrelated European individuals from the UK Biobank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find evidence suggesting fitness effects in heterozygous carriers for recessive genes, especially for variants in constrained genes across a broad range of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest reproductive effects at the population level, and hence natural selection, for autosomal-recessive disease variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, variants in genes that underlie intellectual disability are associated with lower educational attainment in carriers, and we observe an altered genetic landscape, characterized by a threefold reduction in the calculated frequency of bi-allelic intellectual disability in the population relative to other recessive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 21:18:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOdFJrdE9Sc0w1dlZVZTFwZTVGQlJYRW13ZVhUSk9UR093TWR5QmpDZlUyRFYtRU5MeDhPdkJ2eVQwN3ZDaVloZ0tFdFdjN0NUcDM1eUpTVmtZa3JSbWlXa19tdjEzZk5IaVg2TUx0TV9sc2FFSGFPS19ZaTlYZlhVaA</guid></item><item><title>沉默三天后，您的大脑化学物质会发生变化-男孩天才报告 | Your brain chemistry changes after just three days of silence - Boy Genius Report</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQUHNsR1FxMWhvdU01U0VuQmpFNXRGQnJWOXZFbDZWNTZLMWVLUjktdVVORWhBNFhoZFVieXpQaFAtbDg2YlRrV1l4ZmlEV3VKS253c1lfSm8yNGpZUnhBSV96NmVPcFRDbHZzS3kzSDNmajJmVldpWVJNN0w0RUkxSjRlOEtUbXREWUlvTWlnQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content no-dropcap"&gt;
								
&lt;p&gt;We tend to think of silence as empty space. The absence of sound. But, it turns out that quiet isn’t passive at all. In fact, after just three days of intentional silence, the brain begins to physically and functionally rewire itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.98.2.676"&gt;growing body of neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; shows that &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4087081/"&gt;silence can spark changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt; comparable to months of meditation, cognitive training, or rigorous exercise. These changes don’t take long to show up, either. They begin after about 72 hours of cumulative quiet.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://techfixated.com/the-shocking-ways-your-brain-changes-after-just-3-days-of-silence/"&gt;most surprising discoveries&lt;/a&gt; centers on the hippocampus, the part of the brain that governs memory. Scientists found that after three days of sustained silence, participants showed measurable growth of new brain cells in this region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of neurogenesis was previously thought to require long-term interventions. But, for people regularly exposed to noise, the effect was even more dramatic, suggesting those most stressed by sound may benefit the most from the changes silence drives in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="bgr-newsletter-signup-form newsletter-signup-form black-bg"&gt;	&lt;h4&gt;Tech.

People shift from fast, high-alert beta waves to slower alpha and theta waves associated with calm focus and creativity. By the third day, participants were reaching these states more quickly, within minutes instead of hours. These same patterns are typically linked to deep meditation or states of flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional benefits are just as striking. After a few days of silence, the brain’s emotional centers change to communicate more efficiently. People become better at noticing early signs of emotional stress and responding to them with more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in silent retreats reported steadier moods, fewer overreactions, and increased resilience. Remarkably, these effects lasted for weeks after the silent period ended. With the brain no longer busy processing constant sound, other senses grow sharper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People demonstrated better vision, taste, smell, and touch, confirmed by standardized testing. This sensory sharpening stems from the brain reallocating resources, a process known as cross-modal plasticity. It’s one reason silence may be especially helpful for those in high-performance sensory fields like culinary arts or design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive performance also improves. Working memory, the ability to hold and manage information in the moment, saw consistent gains. People recalled details more easily, solved problems faster, and made fewer mental errors after just a few days of silence. These advantages appeared across a wide range of individuals, from professionals to retirees, signifying major changes in the brain.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silence may even help protect the brain over time. Long-term studies found that regular quiet periods could slow age-related decline and reduce stress-related damage to the brain. In clinical trials with older adults, structured silence improved memory, lowered anxiety, and delayed the progression of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to go on a remote retreat to experience these benefits. About two hours of accumulated quiet a day—spaced throughout mornings, breaks, and evenings—is enough to produce measurable effects, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the day without screens, taking a short walk without earbuds, or carving out ten minutes between tasks can all add up. We’re still working to understand how the brain changes, and we just found out&lt;a href="https://bgr.com/science/the-brain-doesnt-learn-how-we-thought-it-does-new-study-reveals/"&gt; the brain doesn’t learn how we thought &lt;/a&gt;But this breakthrough takes us one step closer to fully understanding the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world filled with endless distractions and digital noise, silence may be one of the most powerful and overlooked tools for mental clarity and long-term brain health. Quiet time, it turns out, isn’t just a luxury. It’s a neurological necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/high-protein-breakfasts-without-eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; gets all the credit, and for good reason. We know that starting our day off with an ample amount of protein (around 20-30 grams) is essential for maintaining our hormone health, preventing mid-morning energy crashes, and keeping us full for longer. One might say &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/what-happens-when-you-eat-protein/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;protein really is &lt;em&gt;that girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But I would like to make a case for another, equally important nutrient to kickstart your mornings—fiber. Dietary fiber is a non-digestible carbohydrate that can be found in plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, and whole grains. Both soluble and insoluble fiber play important roles in &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;, and consuming enough fiber regularly has been shown to lower cholesterol, promote a healthy GI tract (by ensuring you’re staying regular), improve blood sugar, and help reduce inflammation, to name a few &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/benefits-of-fiber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;	




&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this vital nutrient is often &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/dietician-nutrition-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;overlooked&lt;/a&gt;. Nearly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10498976/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;19 out of 20 Americans&lt;/a&gt; do not consume the minimum recommended amount of fiber each day. According to the National Academy of Medicine, women under age 50 should aim to consume &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/fiber/art-20043983#:~:text=How%20much%20fiber%20do%20you,women%20age%2050%20or%20younger." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;25 grams of fiber per day&lt;/a&gt;. This means choosing high-fiber foods (5-10 grams) at each meal can help you reach your daily goal. (A gentle reminder that if you don’t regularly consume large amounts of fiber, to take it slow and make sure you are staying hydrated to prevent unwanted gas and bloating.) The good news is that dietary fiber is not difficult to incorporate into your favorite &lt;a href="https://theeverygirl.com/how-breakfast-can-change-eating-habits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; go-tos, plus by prioritizing fiber first thing in the morning, you can ensure that you are reaping the health benefits all day long. Keep reading for high-fiber breakfasts you can make today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-1-peanut-butter-banana-overnight-oats"&gt;1. Peanut Butter Banana Overnight Oats&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-1.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526745"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://livelytable.com/peanut-butter-banana-overnight-oats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lively Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to high-fiber breakfasts, oatmeal gets all the buzz. Oats contain a prebiotic fiber called beta-glucan, which is known to feed the good bacteria living in your gut. This recipe contains a few different fiber sources—peanut butter, banana, and oats—for a well-rounded breakfast option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2-sweet-potato-black-bean-avocado-breakfast-burritos"&gt;2. Sweet Potato Black Bean Avocado Breakfast Burritos&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-2.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526746"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-sweet-potato-black-bean-avocado-breakfast-burritos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ambitious Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beans are a great way to include both plant-based protein and fiber in your diet. One cup of black beans contains 15 grams of fiber—we love to see it! The great thing about breakfast burritos is that you can customize them to your liking. Follow this recipe with sweet potatoes and avocado, or consider using white beans with tomatoes and feta for Mediterranean-inspired flavors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-3-chia-seed-pudding"&gt;3. Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-3.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526747"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/chia-seed-pudding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Love &amp;amp; Lemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds pack 10 grams of fiber in 2 tablespoons, making chia seed pudding a great option to keep things moving (if you know what I mean). I love making a big batch of chia seed pudding at the beginning of the week so I have it on hand when rushing out the door in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-4-honey-lemon-ricotta-breakfast-toast-with-figs-and-pistachios"&gt;4. Honey Lemon Ricotta Breakfast Toast with Figs and Pistachios&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-4.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526748"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/honey-lemon-ricotta-breakfast-toast-with-figs-pistachios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ambitious Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this decadent toast situation, choosing a whole grain bread (look for whole wheat as the first ingredient) will help up the fiber. The combination of figs and pistachios offers additional health benefits, as figs are an antioxidant and pistachios provide heart-healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-5-zucchini-oatmeal-breakfast-cookies"&gt;5. Zucchini Oatmeal Breakfast Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-5.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526749"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://livelytable.com/zucchini-oatmeal-breakfast-cookies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lively Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean, who doesn’t want dessert for breakfast? Not only do these breakfast cookies contain fiber from the oats and zucchini, but they are also made with &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-flaxseeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;flaxseed,&lt;/a&gt; an ingredient known to help aid in disease prevention and promote better digestion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-6-sauteed-breakfast-salad"&gt;6. Sauteed Breakfast Salad&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-6.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526750"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/sauteed-breakfast-salad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When I saw this breakfast salad recipe, I honestly wondered why I hadn’t thought of this for myself. I mean, a cobb salad (bacon, eggs) basically is breakfast if you really think about it. Pack in your micronutrients and fiber from the greens and top with your typical breakfast favorites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-7-cinnamon-quinoa-breakfast-bowl"&gt;7. Cinnamon Quinoa Breakfast Bowl&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-7.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526751"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/cinnamon-quinoa-breakfast-bowl/#wprm-recipe-container-34219" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to grains, you don’t have to stick to only oatmeal to get your fiber in at breakfast. Quinoa is a great base because you can make it sweet, like this recipe here, or go a more savory route with eggs, greens, and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-8-sweet-potato-toast"&gt;8. Sweet Potato Toast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-8.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526752"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/sweet-potato-toast/#wprm-recipe-container-7048" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Feel Good Foodie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s a little dated, but will sweet potato toast really ever go out of style? I’m certainly not against bread, but if you want to incorporate both more fiber and vegetables throughout your day, sweet potato toast is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-9-creamy-clementine-smoothie"&gt;9. Creamy Clementine Smoothie&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-9.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526753"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingbirdfood.com/creamy-clementine-smoothie/#wprm-recipe-container-33463" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Eating Bird Food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smoothies are an easy way to pack in fiber with various fruits, greens, and seeds. This recipe offers the antioxidant benefits of vitamin C found in the clementines while also utilizing protein powder for a filling breakfast option.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-10-shakshuka"&gt;10. Shakshuka&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://media.theeverygirl.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/high-fiber-breakfast-the-everygirl-10.jpg" alt="high fiber breakfast" class="wp-image-526754"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Source: &lt;a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/shakshuka-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Love &amp;amp; Lemons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shakshuka is a popular Northern African and Middle Eastern dish prepared with poached eggs in a tomato sauce flavored with spices. This recipe is a great way to start your day with a variety of veggies, and you can up the fiber by pairing it with whole wheat pita or bread.&lt;/p&gt;

I found the oats aisle and just stood there, attempting to make sense of the four dozen options in front of me, in every form, flavor, and level of added sugar. They all looked equally “processed” to me. I gave up, leaving the store without oats and with a heavy load of emotional exhaustion. And that’s just the oatmeal section of the grocery store, never mind the stacks of snacks, drinks, and condiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Welcome to the new supermarket anxiety plaguing Americans who want to eat healthier but aren’t quite sure how. By now, you’re likely aware of the overwhelming, still growing evidence of the health risks of ultra-processed foods (UPFs), which links their overconsumption to a greater chance of premature death, as well as to plenty of its contributors: cognitive decline, dementia, depression and anxiety, several types of cancer, heart disease, inflammation, insulin resistance, and gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. Yeah, rough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What’s wild is that UPFs are a huge part of what we eat. The average American’s diet consists of about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001253?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001253?via%3Dihub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="57 percent UPFs" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;57 percent UPFs&lt;/a&gt;; that jumps to about two-thirds for children and teens.

And they’re aiming to add nuance to the narrative that any UPF is bad for you. “Large population studies have begun to show that what is currently categorized as ultra-processed food may not be equally bad for our health,” Menichetti says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="where-the-dangers-of-upfs-are" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;Where the Dangers of UPFs Are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Knowing what makes one package of anything better than another means decoding why UPFs are linked to so many major health problems. Researchers don’t quite know yet. In fact, there’s not even a clear, specific definition of “ultra-​processed” that all scientists agree on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What we’re not talking about is stuff like olive oil and frozen strawberries. Yes, these foods are processed, but oil pressing and flash freezing are considered minimal forms of processing, not ultra-processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The definition used by many researchers comes from the Nova classification system, developed by a team led by Brazilian scientist Carlos Monteiro, MD, PhD. Nova divides foods into four groups, from unprocessed or minimally processed to UPFs, which are foods made entirely or mostly from substances extracted from whole foods or synthesized in a laboratory. According to this system, UPFs are designed to be “hyper-palatable and attractive, with a long shelf-life.” Per one of Dr. Monteiro’s studies, they also tend to be “energy-dense, high in unhealthy types of fat, refined starches, free sugars and salt, and poor sources of protein, dietary fiber, and micronutrients.” So that would include cookies, sweet yogurts, energy drinks, instant soups, and food “nuggets.” Some critics say Nova puts too much weight on the number of ingredients in a product and the number of processes it goes through. Under its terms, some healthful homemade foods would be considered processed, such as hummus made from canned beans or made-from-scratch bread. Still, Nova is often used in studying exactly why UPFs do a number on your body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-upfs-affect-us" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1m9gjyt emevuu60"&gt;How UPFs Affect Us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“There’s no shortage of really interesting and compelling-sounding theories about how ultra-processed food might impact human health,” says Kevin Hall, PhD, who’s doing dietary intervention studies on UPFs at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One effect is straightforward: “They make people eat more,” says Marion Nestle, PhD, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University. Hall saw this in a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7946062/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7946062/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="groundbreaking 2019 study" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;groundbreaking 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; in which 20 people spent two weeks eating a diet of 81 percent UPFs. They then spent another two weeks eating a diet with the same amount of protein, fat, and carbs but from non-UPF foods. On both diets, they could eat as little or as much as they wanted. Given that the nutrient distribution was the same, Hall didn’t expect to see a big difference—but he proved himself wrong. On the UPF diet, people ate about 500 more calories a day and, unsurprisingly, gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You might think it’s obvious that people overeat UPFs because their fat, sugar, and sodium content makes them taste really good. Those extra calories can lead to obesity, which contributes to most of the health issues linked to UPFs, Nestle says. But other researchers think that answer is too simplistic and suggest it may be that the body absorbs UPFs so quickly that they don’t make us feel full. Or that these foods lack the fiber your microbiome needs to help manage your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s also possible that processing itself can change a food in unexpected ways. Anthony Fardet, PhD, a food scientist at France’s National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, cites a theory that xenobiotics, or synthetic chemicals, might be damaging. These could be lab-made additives, or even compounds leached from packaging into the food itself. Either way, xenobiotics don’t exist in nature, he says, and we don’t know how they affect our biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Emulsifiers are coming under scrutiny as well. These are substances designed to stabilize UPFs by holding together two liquids, usually oil and water. Emerging research in top journals such as Gastroenterology indicates that some of these, such as polysorbate-80 (used in foods like ice cream) and the texture modifier carboxymethylcellulose (which could be in anything from sausages to baked goods to candy), can lead to inflammation in the gut. This could prevent adequate nutrient absorption and damage your metabolism. Other emulsifiers may be harmless; some may combine to cause trouble. So, it’s complicated. “The idea is to start looking at foods not only by considering one chemical at a time, one nutrient at a time, but by looking at how these different chemicals influence each other and how the overall profile of chemicals determines the quality of food,” Menichetti says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;We know this is a lot. And so do the scientists, who are only in the early stages of unpacking what makes UPFs so damaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So what are you supposed to do while researchers figure it out? Tech tools might help a bit (see below). But when you’ve got to go packaged, at least aim to offset the effects we know about so far: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Pick the products that are lowest in added sugar—since added sugars are often a big sign of a less-healthy UPF. Same with sugar alcohols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Find ways to add omega-3s to your diet. A high-UPF diet generally doesn’t include much of these. Try having a meal with salmon or tuna each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Load up on fiber, since a high-UPF diet can leave you lacking here. Make an effort: Your goal should be 30 to 38 grams a day, ideally from a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;• Determine whether some of the foods you consume are actually increasing your hunger or your desire to eat. Consider tracking what you eat for a week. Do you notice that you eat more on certain days with certain types of foods? If you can identify which are more addictive for you, focus on alternatives to those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Menichetti and her team want to make all of this easier by diving into the thicket of details so you don’t have to—so they’ve started a database, TrueFood, to help. And they’re also wishing that the food industry had better labeling and, ideally, better foods. Nestle echoes that, saying that better regulations could force the food industry to make healthier products. People trying to eat better are “fighting the entire food system on their own,” she says. “That’s really hard to do.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Eventually, when I’m in the oats aisle, I’ll have great tools to help me. In the meantime, I’ll use the strategies on the left and try to choose as many foods as I can that look as close as possible to, well, food.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-16" data-node-id="23" class="embed css-0 e1ghppmw21"&gt;&lt;h5 class="css-1xzp1k0 e1ghppmw17"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Can Tech Help You Make Better Supermarket Choices?&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-zjn93n eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class="css-117i6qr e1ghppmw18"&gt;&lt;div class="css-33w51f e1ghppmw20"&gt;&lt;div class="css-u94zfv e1ghppmw16"&gt;&lt;div class="css-9xcc4r e1ghppmw15"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/truefood-68264ba4c382b.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&amp;amp;resize=640:*" alt="logo featuring stylized letters tf within a square set against a circular yellow background" title="logo featuring stylized letters tf within a square set against a circular yellow background" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-s7sxc4 e1ghppmw12"&gt;True Food&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;div class="css-1jqyc6t e1ghppmw11"&gt;&lt;p class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.truefood.tech/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.truefood.tech/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="This website" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;This website&lt;/a&gt; analyzes a product’s ingredients and spits out a score from 0 to 100, indicating how highly processed that food is likely to be.

Researchers found that GBM patients taking gabapentin lived several months longer than those who did not, across two independent hospital datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings stem from insights into how brain tumors exploit neural signaling, with gabapentin potentially disrupting this interaction by lowering levels of a key protein, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). While promising, the study is retrospective and calls for randomized trials to validate gabapentin as a therapeutic option for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survival Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; GBM patients on gabapentin survived 4–6 months longer on average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Gabapentin use was linked to lower serum TSP-1, a tumor-promoting protein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings were replicated in over 1,000 patients across two medical centers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study by investigators from Mass General Brigham suggests that gabapentin, a relatively common anti-seizure/pain medication, is linked to improved survival in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) — the most common and deadly form of brain cancer in adults. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications, &lt;/em&gt;are based on a retrospective analysis and add new evidence to help patients with this devastating disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109987"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gabapentin-glioblastoma-cancer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Many of the patients were already taking gabapentin for reasons that typically centered on nerve pain. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is an exciting step forward,” said lead author Joshua Bernstock, MD, PhD, a clinical fellow in the Department of Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GBM is a relentlessly progressive and nearly universally fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discovery that an already approved medication with a favorable safety profile can extend overall survival represents a meaningful and potentially practice-changing advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBM is a highly aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer. With about 12,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States, GBM accounts for most primary brain tumors in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall survival has barely improved over the last several decades, with most patients living only 12 to 14 months after diagnosis and 5.5 months after recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study was sparked by insight from the field of cancer neuroscience. This research area focuses on how tumors manipulate neural signaling to fuel their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; identified thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1)—a protein involved in neural circuit development and remodeling—as a key mediator of interactions between neurons and tumor cells that promote glioma growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, this neuron–tumor axis was successfully targeted using gabapentin, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by this research, Bernstock and colleagues analyzed the outcomes of 693 GBM patients at Mass General Brigham. Many of the patients were already taking gabapentin for reasons that typically centered on nerve pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who were taking the drug survived an average of 16 months compared to 12 months for those who weren’t. This four-month survival benefit was statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the results seemed “almost too good to be true,” according to Bernstock, he connected with Dr. Shawn Hervey-Jumper’s team at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to add to the dataset and discovered they were able to replicate what was found at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 379 patients with newly diagnosed GBM included in the UCSF cohort, patients on gabapentin survived an average of 20.8 months, while those not taking gabapentin survived an average of 14.7 months. Together, the data included 1,072 patients and found a significant survival benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that patients treated with gabapentin had lower levels of serum TSP-1, suggesting that the protein may serve as an indicator of treatment response. However, the relationship between TSP-1 levels and gabapentin needs further investigation, Bernstock said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been very few advances in survival for GBM patients since the early 2000s,” Bernstock said. “We need to think more creatively about the emerging biology in these tumors and how to target them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are promising, the study is retrospective — the researchers didn’t give patients gabapentin in a controlled way to test its effects. Bernstock stressed that larger, randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the results and explore the role of gabapentin and TSP-1 in GBM progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this brain cancer and neuropharmacology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#583d352d2a28302118353f3a76372a3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liz Murphy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mgb.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mass General&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liz Murphy – Mass General&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59614-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gabapentinoids confer survival benefit in human glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;” by Joshua Bernstock et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gabapentinoids confer survival benefit in human glioblastoma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuronal-glioma interactions are increasingly recognized as critical in the development and progression of central nervous system tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research highlights that gliomas can integrate into neural circuits through various mechanisms, including the synaptogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new mechanistic understanding of cancer neuroscience allows for novel insights into target discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critically, therapies that modulate neuron-tumor interactions remain agnostic to other oncogenic changes within tumor cells yet may still target fundamental drivers of tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with these findings and controlling for critical confounding variables, we demonstrate a survival benefit associated with gabapentin (an antagonist of TSP-1) following surgical resection of newly diagnosed glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study included 1,072 patients, with a discovery cohort of 693 patients and an additional 379 patients from a separate site for external validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our findings indicate that gabapentin administration is associated with reduced serum TSP-1 levels, suggesting its potential as a future biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 20:25:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBCNHNtNkNhNTdEeG9XNklXdlVMSF9sWmJRRjBBM3ZPT0lVNnNIT1ZoenZpZ052REZHT25pVFN0OUxsTkxid3RJR08zeGljdHZ4ZEtiRTdXa2g4eDI3ZTdjd2wxZHdvb3dvcXY4UlRMYXIxakM4</guid></item><item><title>医生通过首个个性化基因编辑疗法Engadget成功治疗婴儿 | Doctors successfully treated a baby with the first ever personalized gene-editing therapy - Engadget</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPRzk5S0VWdVFHNGtEbk01S0QzME16bjhhSUJmbGszNmcyU0t3MS1lcUc0emhwYTFTS0ZnMVZrZGQ4RURyS2gxYW5uUHoydVNIRW5zZk5uLW9lMnhhT1M0MWNwZmR0c0NrLVVOVFlnS0I5cWZ6clpvZkZOQU54Y2M3bXVDRm9jcDVzYm5IS2I3UG0tLWZoQ1h1T2Vva2ZkQ1ZMVTd0aW84dEp3RFM0STJvaEtBSW5NVkxUWUkwcmNRR25scXhfNUtTdzgzS2hibVBLUWNB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of doctors and scientists have successfully treated a rare genetic condition with the first-ever personalized gene-editing therapy.

The study revealed lower levels of nerve growth factor and elevated inflammatory markers in the long COVID group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite performing similarly on standard cognitive tests, these individuals reported poorer quality of life, physical and emotional health, and showed deficits in verbal fluency. These findings validate the experiences of long COVID patients and suggest biological markers could help clinicians better diagnose and treat persistent symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biomarker Imbalance:&lt;/strong&gt; Long COVID patients had lower nerve growth factor and higher IL-10, indicating impaired neuroplasticity and inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language Deficits:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants with long COVID performed worse on letter fluency tests, despite otherwise normal cognitive assessments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Quality of Life:&lt;/strong&gt; Long COVID patients reported poorer physical, emotional, and psychological well-being than recovered individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Corewell Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study that is the first to compare inflammation and brain stress responses in long COVID-19 patients with individuals who have fully recovered shows that those with continued brain fog and other cognitive issues have a lower ability to adapt to stress and higher levels of inflammation in their brains. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous long COVID studies have shown changes in these markers in mice, this study evaluated the infection’s impact on the brain in documented COVID-positive patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109983"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a head and red fog." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuroinflammation-stress-long-COVID-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;According to the study authors, the struggle physicians have with evaluating long COVID patients is that when asked to complete various written diagnostic tests, they tend to look normal. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until now, physicians have found it difficult to understand why certain patients develop post-COVID cognitive symptoms while others do not. Recent studies estimate tens of millions of people worldwide still have not recovered from the COVID infection, even five years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We compared our long COVID participants to our healthy, fully recovered control group based on neurocognitive measures, emotional functioning, measures of quality of life as well as specific changes in blood markers assessing stress response,” said lead author Michael Lawrence, Ph.D., neuropsychologist at Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To our knowledge, this is the first controlled study that shows specific self-reported neurocognitive and central nervous systems changes in long COVID patients which validates the symptoms they’ve been experiencing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pilot study, published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;, included 17 confirmed COVID patients (10 with long COVID and seven who were fully recovered with no lingering symptoms) and found the following:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Serum levels of nerve growth factor, a biomarker of the brain’s ability to change and adapt by forming new connections, were significantly lower in the long COVID group. This group was also more likely to have higher serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10, a marker of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While there was virtually no difference between groups related to neuropsychological test outcomes, long COVID participants did score significantly lower on letter fluency, meaning they had more difficulty with quickly and accurately accessing language centers in the brain and producing words beginning with various letters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The long COVID group also had significantly lower ratings than healthy controls on quality of life, physical health, emotional functioning and psychological well-being responses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although this is a small study and more work needs to be done, from a clinical application standpoint, physicians potentially can identify individuals who are struggling sooner and provide wrap-around care that could be helpful to them,” said Judith Arnetz, Ph.D., professor emerita at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, the struggle physicians have with evaluating long COVID patients is that when asked to complete various written diagnostic tests, they tend to look normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These patients experience significant frustration, and their symptoms often may be minimized by friends, family and even the medical community,” Dr. Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s tough when everything looks normal on paper, but our patients continue to struggle and report a multitude of difficulties.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Arnetz agreed and indicated that physicians might want to take a multidisciplinary approach to care and assess inflammatory and brain biomarkers, which could ultimately offer a better path forward in treating patients with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additional services such as speech therapy, psychotherapy for stress reduction and incorporating medications that target fatigue and mental fogginess could all be elements of creating a successful treatment plan as well,” Dr. Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this long COVID and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6d1e0c1f04030c430a01080c1e02032d0e021f081a08010105080c01190543021f0a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sarina Gleason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://corewellhealth.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Corewell Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Sarina Gleason – Corewell Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

in &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;, describes a 58-year-old woman who, an estimated 48 years after treatment with cadaver-derived human growth hormone, died of iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iCJD), a prion disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient, who sought care after developing gait imbalance and tremors 2 weeks earlier, had received prion-contaminated cadaveric human growth hormone (chGH) for 9.3 years starting at age 7. Prion diseases, which affect both humans and animals, are fatal neurologic conditions caused by infectious misfolded proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;chGH is a well-described iatrogenic (healthcare-related) cause of this type of CJD. The National Hormone Pituitary Program (NHPP) administered the drug to treat growth failure to roughly 7,700 US patients from the 1960s through the 1980s, the researchers noted.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;An outbreak of chGH-related iCJD, first recognized in the United States in 1985, prompted the immediate shutdown of chGH production and NHPP administration of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, chGH was replaced with recombinant (biosynthetic) human growth hormone, but the iCJD outbreak continued due to the often-long latency period in some previous chGH recipients. Latency periods for prion diseases are variable and depend on factors such as the infectious particle dose (higher doses are linked to shorter latency); route of infection (central nervous system [CNS] exposures are tied to shorter latency than peripheral ones); and recipient genetics, particularly the codon 129 polymorphism in the &lt;em&gt;PRNP&lt;/em&gt; gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;iCJD is more of a public health concern than the other two CJD types—sporadic and genetic—because of its potential to cause outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rapid clinical deterioration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This patient was the 36th iCJD case among US NHPP chGH recipients and the 254th such case worldwide as of January 2024.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When she presented for treatment, her medical history included depression, cervical spine fusion, and idiopathic panhypopituitarism, a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland doesn't produce all or most of its hormones, but it isn't clear why. The initial neurologic exam showed frequent lateral movements of the head and trunk, as well as irregular hand movements that went away with distraction, but the exam was otherwise unremarkable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spine revealed no pathology. Results of the Mayo Clinic Autoimmune Movement Disorders Panel and HIV screening were negative, and copper, vitamin E, and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels were within normal ranges. The patient was referred to the movement disorders clinic and advised to start physical therapy and continue psychologic treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-right"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the next month, the patient developed urinary incontinence, worsening tremors, decreased speech, and abnormal gait. She returned to the hospital with tachypnea (abnormally fast breathing), hyperekplexia (exaggerated startle reflex with intense muscle stiffness), and appendicular rigidity (stiffness in the arms and legs). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Her breathing and alertness quickly declined, and she was intubated. In the next several days, she developed both stimulus-induced and spontaneous myoclonus (a neurologic condition featuring sudden, involuntary muscle jerks or twitches), and she remained in a coma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Positive prion assay, death&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A repeat brain MRI 2 months after the initial exam revealed lesions, and continuous electroencephalography showed frequent 1- to 2.5-Hertz generalized periodic discharges of 3 to 9 seconds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The woman's antinuclear antibody level was mildly positive, but all other serum test results, including for autoantibodies, generated no pathologic findings. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viral and autoantibody test results were negative. Oligoclonal bands (proteins in the CSF that can indicate CNS inflammation or damage) were absent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prion testing at the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case Western Reserve University showed substantially elevated total tau (protein that forms tangles in the brain) and a very high concentration of 14-3-3 protein. A real-time quaking-induced conversion assay was positive for prions. Per the patient's documented wishes, she was extubated and died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure role="group" class="caption caption-img align-left"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An autopsy performed at NPDPSC confirmed CJD via Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis of brain tissue. An examination of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PRNP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; gene, which is involved in genetic CJD, was negative for pathogenic mutations, supporting a diagnosis of iCJD in the context of previous chGH treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The patient had a methionine/valine polymorphism (change in the DNA sequence that is common in a population) at codon 129 of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PRNP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; gene, which has been tied to longer incubation periods in acquired human prion diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;Difficult to estimate latency &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Determining the precise latency period for chGH-linked iCJD cases is often impossible, because patients were often exposed to chGH for many years, the researchers said. But it can be estimated using the interval from the first dose of chGH and iCJD symptom onset, the period from the midpoint of chGH treatment to iCJD symptom onset, the time between the last dose of chGH and symptom onset, and the midpoint of chGH treatment calculated from the first chGH dose to the end of 1977.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of note, none of the 36 US iCJD cases exclusively received post-1977 chGH, likely because the NHPP developed a new laboratory method to extract chGH from pituitary glands in 1977.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The reason for considering that method of calculation involves the epidemiology of the US outbreak, which suggests that the most likely source of iCJD infection came from chGH administered before or during 1977, even though most of the ≈7,700 NHPP recipients started chGH treatment after 1977," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Of note, none of the 36 US iCJD cases exclusively received post-1977 chGH, likely because the NHPP developed a new laboratory method to extract chGH from pituitary glands in 1977," they added. "That method included column purification to separate and collect multiple hormones from the glands, a procedure now known to have greatly reduced prion contamination."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;New outbreak cases still possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For this study, the team performed all four latency estimate calculations: "First dose of chGH to symptom onset was 51.3 years, midpoint of chGH treatment to symptom onset was 46.7 years, last dose of chGH to symptom onset was 42.1 years, and midpoint of pre-1978 chGH to symptom onset was 48.3 years. We compared our patient’s latency estimate calculation to all US chGH-associated iCJD cases, and given the evidence implicating pre-1978 chGH, we considered the final method to provide the most accurate estimate of 48.3 years latency."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clinicians should recognize the continued possibility of chGH-associated CJD cases and include iCJD in the differential diagnosis for anyone with new neurologic symptoms and prior chGH exposure, particularly patients exposed to chGH before the 1977 updated purification process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The estimated latency of the ongoing US chGH-related iCJD outbreak was 10 years, compared with 5 years among the first 226 cases reported internationally, which the authors said suggests a lower level of prion contamination in US NHPP-distributed chGH. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Also, experimental transmission studies in nonhuman primates using samples of all 76 lots of chGH retained at the US NHPP demonstrated that prion contamination was rare and random. "That low level of contamination, the purification step introduced in the United States in 1977, and the peripheral route of administration created an environment that would be expected to result in longer latency periods," the investigators noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the US iCJD outbreak has slowed considerably, new cases are still possible, particularly among chGH recipients who are heterozygous M/V at codon 129 of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;PRNP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; gene. "Clinicians should recognize the continued possibility of chGH-associated CJD cases and include iCJD in the differential diagnosis for anyone with new neurologic symptoms and prior chGH exposure, particularly patients exposed to chGH before the 1977 updated purification process," they concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is the process where cells break down glucose to produce energy, which cancer cells use to grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While taurine is naturally produced in the human body and found in foods such as meat and fish, it is also added to many energy drinks for its purported benefits, such as improving mental performance and reducing inflammation. It has also been used to alleviate chemotherapy side effects in leukemia patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study suggests that the excessive intake of taurine, particularly through supplements and energy drinks, could exacerbate leukemia by providing additional fuel for cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 dcjixd"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/16/drinks.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/16/drinks.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/15/16/16/drinks.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A new study warns energy drink consumers about excessive amounts of taurine, which is naturally produced by the body but excessive amounts can increase the risk of blood cancer." class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-30507"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;A new study warns energy drink consumers about excessive amounts of taurine, which is naturally produced by the body but excessive amounts can increase the risk of blood cancer.&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study looked at mice with a special gene called SLC6A6, which helps move taurine around the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also gave these mice human leukemia cells to see how they would react.

			&lt;p&gt;Sitting in my doctor's examination room, I was surprised when she told me, "Genetics don't really matter for chronic disease." Rather, she continued, "A person's lifestyle, what they eat, and how much they exercise, determine whether they get heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a researcher who &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZisO_BUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;studies the genetics of disease&lt;/a&gt;, I don't fully disagree – &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/environmental-health-tracking/php/data-research/lifestyle-risk-factors.html"&gt;lifestyle factors&lt;/a&gt; play a large role in determining who gets a disease and who doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are far from the entire story. Since scientists &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-human-genome-project-pieced-together-only-92-of-the-dna-now-scientists-have-finally-filled-in-the-remaining-8-176138"&gt;mapped out the human genome&lt;/a&gt; in 2003, researchers have learned that genetics also play a large role in a person's disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies that focus on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3941"&gt;estimating disease heritability&lt;/a&gt; – that is, how much genetic differences explain differences in disease risk – usually attribute a substantial fraction of disease variation to genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations across the entire genome seem to play a role in diseases such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-022-01058-3"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, which is about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0241-6"&gt;17% heritable&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04434-5"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, which is about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-023-02293-8"&gt;80% heritable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/Genetic-Disorders/Tay-Sachs-Disease"&gt;Tay-Sachs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/cystic-fibrosis/causes"&gt;cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;, where mutations in a single gene cause a disease, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abi8206"&gt;chronic diseases tend to be polygenic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they're influenced by multiple mutations at many genes across the whole genome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every complex disease has both genetic and environmental risk factors. Most researchers study these factors separately because of technical challenges and a lack of large, uniform datasets. Although some have devised techniques to overcome these challenges, they haven't yet been applied to a comprehensive set of diseases and environmental exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our recently published research, my colleague &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JX656y0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Alkes Price&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.at/citations?user=ZisO_BUAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;and I&lt;/a&gt; developed tools to leverage newly available datasets to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;quantify the joint effects&lt;/a&gt; that genetic and environmental risk factors have on the biology underlying disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aspirin, genetics and colon cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the effect gene-environment interactions have on disease, let's consider the example of aspirin use and colon  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="161529" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center were studying how &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11325819/"&gt;regularly taking aspirin&lt;/a&gt; decreased the risk of colon cancer. They wondered whether genetic mutations that slowed down how quickly the body broke down aspirin – meaning aspirin levels in the body would stay high longer – might increase the drug's protective effect against colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were right: Only patients with slow aspirin metabolism had a decreased risk of colon cancer, indicating that the effectiveness of a drug can depend on a person's genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of how genetics and different &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/your-environment-affects-how-well-your-medications-work-identifying-exactly-how-could-make-medicine-better-246476"&gt;combinations of environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt;, such as the medications a patient is taking, can affect a person's disease risk and how effective a treatment will be for them. How many cases of genetic variations directly influencing a drug's effectiveness are there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMyZO9YDlk8?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Rather than 'nature versus nurture,' a more accurate way of describing gene-environment interactions is 'nature through nurture.'&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene-environment interaction of colon cancer and aspirin is unusual. It involves a mutation at a single location in the genome that has a big effect on colon cancer risk. The past 25 years of human genetics have shown researchers that these sorts of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08494"&gt;large-effect mutations are rare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an analysis found that the median effect of a genetic variant on height is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038"&gt;only 0.14 millimeters&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, there are usually hundreds of variations that each have small but cumulative effects on a person's disease risk, making them hard to find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could researchers detect these small gene-environment interactions across hundreds of spots in the genome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Polygenic gene-environment interactions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We started by looking for cases where genetic variants across the genome showed different effects on a person's biology in different environments. Rather than trying to detect the small effects of each genetic variant one at a time, we &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;aggregated data across the entire genome&lt;/a&gt; to turn these small individual effects into a large, genome-wide effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; – a large database containing genetic and health data from about 500,000 people – we estimated the influence of millions of genetic variants on 33 complex traits and diseases, such as height and asthma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We grouped people based on environmental exposures such as air pollution, cigarette smoking and dietary patterns. Finally, we developed statistical tests to study how the effects of genetics on disease risk and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/biomarker"&gt;biomarker levels&lt;/a&gt; varied with these exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found three types of gene-environment interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;19 pairs&lt;/a&gt; of complex traits and environmental exposures that are influenced by genetic variants across the genome. For example, the effect of genetics on white blood cell levels in the body differed between smokers and nonsmokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161535" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/genetic_risk_smoking_642.jpg" alt="hand holding a cigarette" class="wp-image-161535 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/genetic_risk_smoking_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/genetic_risk_smoking_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/genetic_risk_smoking_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161535" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Effects of genes on levels of white cells vary depending on if you smoke. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADkyWMu9aY/"&gt;rattanakun/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we compared the effects of genetic mutations between the two groups, the strength of gene-environment interaction suggested that smoking changes the way genetics influence white blood cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we looked for cases where the heritability of a trait varies depending on the environment. In other words, rather than some genetic variants having different effects in different environments, all of them are made stronger in some environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we found that the heritability of body mass index – the ratio of weight to height – increased by 5% for the most active people. This means genetics plays a larger role in BMI the more active you are. We found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;28 such trait-environment pairs&lt;/a&gt;, including HDL cholesterol levels and alcohol consumption, as well as neuroticism and self-reported sleeplessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we looked for a type of gene-environment interaction called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100297"&gt;proportional or joint amplification&lt;/a&gt;. Here, genetic effects grow with increased environmental exposures, and vice versa. This results in a relatively equal balance of genetic and environmental effects on a trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, as self-reported time spent watching television increased, both genetic and environmental variance increased for a person's waist-to-hip ratio. This likely reflects the influence of other behaviors related to time spent watching television, such as decreased physical exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2025.01.014"&gt;15 such trait-environment pairs&lt;/a&gt;, including lung capacity and smoking, and glucose levels and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also looked for cases where biological sex, instead of environmental exposures, influenced interactions with genes. Previous work had shown evidence of these &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00912-0"&gt;gene-by-sex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100297"&gt;interactions&lt;/a&gt;, and we found additional examples of the effects of biological sex on all three types of gene-environment interactions. For example, we found that neuroticism had genetic effects that varied across sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also found that multiple types of gene-environment interactions can affect the same trait. For example, the effects of genetics on systolic blood pressure varied by sex, indicating that some genetic variants have different effects in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New gene-environment models&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do we make sense of these distinct types of gene-environment interactions? We argue that they can help researchers better understand the underlying biological mechanisms that lead from genetic and environmental risks to disease, and how genetic variation leads to differences in disease risk between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes related to the same function work together in a &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Biological-Pathways-Fact-Sheet"&gt;unit called a pathway&lt;/a&gt;. For example, we can say that genes involved in making heme – the component of red blood cells that carries oxygen – are collectively part of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537329/"&gt;heme synthesis pathway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting amounts of heme circulating in the body influence other biological processes, including ones that could lead to the development of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/17705-low-hemoglobin"&gt;anemia and cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Our model suggests that environmental exposures modify different parts of these pathways, which may explain why we saw different types of gene-environment interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, these findings could lead to treatments that are more personalized based on a person's genome. For example, clinicians might one day be able to tell whether someone is more likely to decrease their risk of heart disease by taking weight loss drugs or by exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results show how studying gene-environment interactions can tell researchers not only about which genetic and environmental factors increase your risk of disease, but also what goes wrong in the body where.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252139/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may only experience shortness of breath and fatigue, while others may only experience brain fog and difficulty concentrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9779497/Blood-test-spot-long-Covid-ready-SIX-MONTHS.html" class=""&gt;diagnosing long Covid&lt;/a&gt; is challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the journal PLOS One, looked at 17 patients aged 25 to 60 who were previously infected with Covid at least six months prior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The participants included 10 people diagnosed with Long Covid and seven who healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All but one patient were female, and the average age was 42. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants completed interviews about their lingering symptoms, which could have included brain fog, memory issues, fatigue, anxiety or depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also performed cognitive tests to evaluate processing speed, language, learning and memory, problem solving, multitasking and concentration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also drew blood samples from each participant to test elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts found Long Covid patients had 33 percent lower levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) in their brains, a protein that helps maintain neurons in the brain and central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low NGF levels have been associated with neurocognitive conditions like Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long Covid patients also had 50 percent more interleukin 10, a protein that helps regulate inflammation and immune responses in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though interleukin 10 normally controls inflammation, high levels can have the opposite effect and create more inflammation in the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine in 10 participants in the Long Covid group had elevated inflammatory markers like interleukin 10 compared to one of out the seven healthy controls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Long Covid patients scored 30 percent lower on tests of language processing, suggesting Long Covid triggers inflammation in the brain's language centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found Long Covid patients were 75 percent more likely than healthy patients to suffer a worsened quality of life overall. They also had a 61 percent increased risk of suffering general pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Alison Cohen, an epidemiologist and long Covid researcher at the University of California San Francisco, never imagined Long Covid would upend her life.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;St. PAUL, Minn., May 15 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; Millions of "long COVID" patients coping with debilitating "brain fog" and chronic fatigue, who are looking for answers to what's at the root of their illness, received a hopeful sign through a new study released Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers, though somewhat complex, appear to be biological and neurological, authors of the study said. In other words, it's not just in patients' heads.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An estimated 12 million COVID "long-haulers" in the United States experience a range of neurological symptoms such as feeling slow, having difficulty thinking or concentrating, confusion and forgetfulness many months after recovery from the viral infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sufferers have reported up to 200 different symptoms, both mental and physical, the most common of which include brain fog, lingering fatigue and shortness of breath.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neurological symptoms, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/how-to-manage-long-covid-brain-fog" target="_blank"&gt;can limit&lt;/a&gt; those who once exceled at sophisticated mental "multitasking" to doing just one thing at a time, making them far less able to handle stress or tap the mental flexibility needed for their jobs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since long COVID first emerged as a recognized syndrome, the hunt has been on to find a "biological mechanism" at the root of the malady. Those efforts got a boost this week with the publication of a small-scale study showing altered levels of a pair of key brain chemicals in patients who complained of symptoms six months after infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Michigan State University said their findings provide more evidence that a biological mechanism is indeed at the root of the cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to directly measure inflammation in long COVID patients and bolsters theories that the pernicious brain fog and fatigue are not just mental issues, but linked to a biological cause that can be objectively assessed, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6% of American adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7350a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; they were experiencing long COVID symptoms in 2023, translating to nearly 25 million people. Of those, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797782" target="_blank"&gt;about half&lt;/a&gt; have complained of brain fog -- and at those levels the need to understand and develop health strategies for them is tremendous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0315486" target="_blank"&gt;The Michigan study&lt;/a&gt;, published in multidisciplinary journal PLOS One, looked for telltale biomarkers and to assess cognition in patients who have been very "conservatively" defined as having long COVID -- that is, those who were still experiencing brain fog six months after initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the authors said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They looked at a total of 17 people with confirmed COVID diagnoses, including 10 who were still reporting long COVID symptoms and a control group of seven others who had recovered without any long-lasting symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that those with the symptoms had lower serum levels of nerve growth factor, or NGF, a protein that plays a key role in neuron development and maintenance of the brain's plasticity. NGF is associated with high-level cognitive functions that require memory and mental flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those same subjects also had higher levels of interleukin-10, a powerful anti-inflammatory protein secreted by white blood cells that plays a crucial role in regulating the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the group also showed declines in "letter fluency," a neurological cognition test meant to measure how quickly subjects can perform "executive function" mental tasks requiring working memory and attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to study co-author Dr. Bengt Arnetz, a professor of family and preventive medicine and former chairman of Michigan State University's Department of Family Medicine Clinical Center, the combination of these biological and neurological differences in long COVID sufferers is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found biological changes, which I think it's very big strength for this study," he told reporters during a virtual press conference earlier this week. "In parallel with the effects on executive function, we also saw that [NGF], which reflects the brain's ability to adapt to grow new neurons and connection, was suppressed in long COVID. This is aligned with the findings in the neuro-cognitive test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"And that's a very novel finding. No one has really looked at that before [among patients] with proven COVID cases who have recovered from the infection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Michael Lawrence, a clinical neuropsychologist with Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, said the long COVID sufferers underwent a battery of psychological exams to assess what effects the condition has had on their mental acuity. He found that, generally speaking, they "look normal on neurocognitive testing" -- except for one measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Out of the multitude of tests that we gave, only one test seemed to show group differences, and that test is a test of what we call letter fluency. It measures executive functioning, but executive functioning under time constraints," he told UPI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long COVID patients come to his practice complaining of challenges relating to fatigue, brain fog and being "ineffective and inefficient," he said, but they are continually frustrated and often feel "invalidated" by the medical community because there was no known biological reason for their complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study results suggest "it's this processing speed-related issue that we think is somewhat related to COVID 'fog,' but also somewhat different, outside of the cognitive domain" -- thus likely pointing to a biological cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficit of interleukin-10, "given that it's an energy production protein... I think there is a relationship there," Lawrence said. "And I think it's helpful, because now we have some objective findings that really confirm what patients are describing and feeling."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study provides hope that "if we can identify these individuals early with biomarkers, then we can develop multidisciplinary treatment to focus on all aspects of the individual," he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think patients and our medical community, at least years ago, tended to separate the mental health from the physical. But what we know is they're all very interconnected. The more we can improve mental health-related symptoms, what we see is decreased reports of pain and fatigue. We really need to treat the whole person, but we need to treat it early."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future researchers "can look at these biomarkers over time to see what treatments tend to affect or change these serum levels," Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study that is the first to compare inflammation and brain stress responses in long COVID-19 patients with individuals who have fully recovered shows that those with continued brain fog and other cognitive issues have a lower ability to adapt to stress and higher levels of inflammation in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;While previous long COVID studies have shown changes in these markers in mice, this study evaluated the infection's impact on the brain in documented COVID-positive patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, physicians have found it difficult to understand why certain patients develop post-COVID cognitive symptoms while others do not. Recent studies estimate tens of millions of people worldwide still have not recovered from the COVID infection, even five years later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We compared our long COVID participants to our healthy, fully recovered &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/control+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;control group&lt;/a&gt; based on neurocognitive measures, emotional functioning, measures of quality of life as well as specific changes in blood markers assessing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stress+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;," said lead author Michael Lawrence, Ph.D., neuropsychologist at Corewell Health in Grand Rapids, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To our knowledge, this is the first controlled study that shows specific self-reported neurocognitive and central nervous system changes in long COVID patients, which validates the symptoms they've been experiencing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pilot+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pilot study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;PLOS One&lt;/i&gt;, included 17 confirmed COVID patients (10 with long COVID and seven who were fully recovered with no lingering symptoms) and found the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serum levels of nerve growth factor, a biomarker of the brain's ability to change and adapt by forming new connections, were significantly lower in the long COVID group. This group was also more likely to have higher serum levels of interleukin (IL)-10, a marker of inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While there was virtually no difference between groups related to neuropsychological test outcomes, long COVID participants did score significantly lower on letter fluency, meaning they had more difficulty with quickly and accurately accessing language centers in the brain and producing words beginning with various letters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The long COVID group also had significantly lower ratings than healthy controls on quality of life, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt;, emotional functioning and psychological well-being responses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Although this is a small study and more work needs to be done, from a clinical application standpoint, physicians can potentially identify individuals who are struggling sooner and provide wrap-around care that could be helpful to them," said Judith Arnetz, Ph.D., professor emerita at Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, the struggle physicians have with evaluating long COVID patients is that when asked to complete various written &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diagnostic+tests/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diagnostic tests&lt;/a&gt;, they tend to look normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These patients experience significant frustration, and their symptoms may often be minimized by friends, family and even the medical community," Dr. Lawrence said. "It's tough when everything looks normal on paper, but our patients continue to struggle and report a multitude of difficulties."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Arnetz agreed and indicated that physicians might want to take a multidisciplinary approach to care and assessing inflammatory and brain biomarkers, which could ultimately offer a better path forward in treating patients with long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Additional services such as speech therapy, psychotherapy for stress reduction and incorporating medications that target fatigue and mental fogginess could all be elements of creating a successful treatment plan as well," Dr. Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-05-15T13:30:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Thursday, May 15, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Infant with rare, incurable disease is first to successfully receive personalized gene therapy treatment&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH-supported gene-editing platform lays groundwork to rapidly develop treatments for other rare genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research team supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed and safely delivered a personalized gene editing therapy to treat an infant with a life-threatening, incurable genetic disease. The infant, who was diagnosed with the rare condition carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency shortly after birth, has responded positively to the treatment. The process, from diagnosis to treatment, took only six months and marks the first time the technology has been successfully deployed to treat a human patient. The technology used in this study was developed using a platform that could be tweaked to treat a wide range of genetic disorders and opens the possibility of creating personalized treatments in other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) developed the customized therapy using the gene-editing platform &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-turning-discovery-into-health/transformative-technologies/crispr-revolution"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt;. They corrected a specific gene mutation in the baby’s liver cells that led to the disorder. CRISPR is an advanced gene editing technology that enables precise changes to DNA inside living cells. This is the first known case of a personalized CRISPR-based medicine administered to a single patient and was carefully designed to target non-reproductive cells so changes would only affect the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a platform, gene editing -- built on reusable components and rapid customization -- promises a new era of precision medicine for hundreds of rare diseases, bringing life-changing therapies to patients when timing matters most: Early, fast, and tailored to the individual,” said Joni L. Rutter, Ph.D., director of NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CPS1 deficiency is characterized by an inability to fully break down byproducts from protein metabolism in the liver, causing ammonia to build up to toxic levels in the body. It can cause severe damage to the brain and liver. Treatment includes a low protein diet until the child is old enough for a liver transplant. However, in this waiting period there is a risk of rapid organ failure due to stressors such as infection, trauma, or dehydration. High levels of ammonia can cause coma, brain swelling, and may be fatal or cause permanent brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The child initially received a very low dose of the therapy at six months of age, then a higher dose later. The research team saw signs that the therapy was effective almost from the start. The six-month old began taking in more protein in the diet, and the care team could reduce the medicine needed to keep ammonia levels low in the body. Another telling sign of the child’s improvement to date came after the child caught a cold, and later, had to deal with a gastrointestinal illness. Normally, such infections for a child in this condition could be extremely dangerous, especially with the possibility of ammonia reaching dangerous levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We knew the method used to deliver the gene-editing machinery to the baby’s liver cells allowed us to give the treatment repeatedly. That meant we could start with a low dose that we were sure was safe,” said CHOP pediatrician Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were very concerned when the baby got sick, but the baby just shrugged the illness off,” said Penn geneticist and first author Kiran Musunuru, M.D., Ph.D. For now, much work remains, but the researchers are cautiously optimistic about the baby’s progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientists announced their work at the American Society of Gene &amp;amp; Cell Therapy Meeting on May 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and described the study in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Yale-led study shows that the senses stimulate a region of the brain that controls consciousness—a finding that might inform treatment for disorders related to attention, arousal, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Humans perceive and navigate the world around us with the help of our five senses: sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell. And while scientists have long known that these different senses activate different parts of the brain, a new Yale-led study indicates that multiple senses all stimulate a critical region deep in the brain that controls consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053811925002277" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;NeuroImage&lt;/i&gt;, sheds new light on how &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensory+perception/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensory perception&lt;/a&gt; works in the brain and may fuel the development of therapies to treat disorders involving attention, arousal, and consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, a research team led by Yale's Aya Khalaf focused on the workings of subcortical arousal systems, brain structure networks that play a crucial role in regulating sleep-wake states. Previous studies on patients with disorders of consciousness—such as coma or epilepsy—have confirmed the influence of these systems on states of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But prior research has been largely limited to tracking individual senses. For the new study, researchers asked if stimuli from multiple senses share the same subcortical arousal networks. They also looked at how shifts in a subject's attention might affect these networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed fMRI (&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/functional+magnetic+resonance+imaging/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt;) datasets collected from 1,561 healthy adult participants as they performed 11 different tasks using four senses: vision, audition, taste, and touch.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;They made two important discoveries: that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensory+input/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensory input&lt;/a&gt; does make use of shared subcortical systems and, more surprisingly, that all input—regardless of which sense delivered the signal—stimulates activity in two deep brain regions, the midbrain reticular formation and the central thalamus, when a subject is sharply focused on the senses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to stimulating the critical central brain regions, they found, were the sudden shifts in attention demanded by the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We were expecting to find activity on shared networks, but when we saw all the senses light up the same central brain regions while a test subject was focusing, it was really astonishing," said Khalaf, a postdoctoral associate in neurology at Yale School of Medicine and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery highlighted how key these central brain regions are in regulating not only disorders of consciousness, but also conditions that impact attention and focus, such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/attention/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;attention&lt;/a&gt; deficit hyperactivity disorder. This finding could lead to better targeted medications and brain stimulation techniques for patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This has also given us insights into how things work normally in the brain," said senior author Hal Blumenfeld, the Mark Loughridge and Michele Williams Professor of Neurology who is also a professor in neuroscience and neurosurgery and director of the Yale Clinical Neuroscience Imaging Center. "It's really a step forward in our understanding of awareness and consciousness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking across senses, this is the first time researchers have seen a result like this, said Khalaf, who is also part of Blumenfeld's lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It tells us how important this brain region is and what it could mean in efforts to restore consciousness," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="investigationandoutcomes" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Investigation and Outcomes"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Investigation and Outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 21, CDC launched a multistate investigation in collaboration with the Georgia Department of Public Health, Texas Department of State Health Services, and Washington State Department of Health to identify and characterize cases. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirteen family members traveled to Arenal and Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, during December 21–28, 2024. Investigation revealed that 12 of the 13 family members toured Venado Caves, a popular tourist location, on December 24 (day 0). All reported seeing bats and having direct contact with bat droppings while crawling and squeezing through tight spaces in the cave. All 12 persons became mildly or moderately ill after returning to the United States, 8–19 days after exposure. Signs and symptoms included headache, malaise, fever, night sweats, myalgias, and respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt;). The one family member who did not tour the cave did not become ill. No other activities reported before, during, or after the trip were associated with known risk for exposure to &lt;i&gt;Histoplasma&lt;/i&gt; species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five adults and one child sought medical care at an urgent or a primary care facility; no travel history was elicited during their examinations. Among these six patients, three received antibiotics, two received corticosteroids, and one received a cough suppressant. One adult was referred to an emergency department and hospitalized because of abnormal chest radiography findings that raised concerns about lung cancer. However, when health care providers requested the patient’s travel history the next day and learned of the visit to a Costa Rican cave with bats, histoplasmosis became the suspected diagnosis. The patient initially was prescribed voriconazole and discharged 2 days after admission; treatment was subsequently changed to itraconazole (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;). By 28 days after exposure, all 12 affected family members had recovered or were improving, consistent with the clinical course of mild or moderate histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungal antigen testing was performed for four family members. Two received antigen test results positive for &lt;i&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/i&gt; species complex, including the hospitalized patient; test results for the other two patients were negative. Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame. However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;). One patient with a positive test result also received positive complement fixation antibody test results on two separate occasions. Also, in addition to the patient with chest radiography findings that initially raised concerns about lung cancer, another patient also had abnormal chest radiography results, including pulmonary nodules and opacities, consistent with histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 12 ill family members were classified as having confirmed (one patient), probable (eight patients), or suspected (three patients) histoplasmosis based on the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) case definition (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). The CSTE case definition includes both laboratory and clinical criteria; cases can be classified as confirmed or probable. Fungal antigen tests are considered nonconfirmatory laboratory criteria based on the CSTE case definition due to cross-reactivity with other fungal pathogens (&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). One patient met the criteria for a confirmed case because the illness was clinically compatible (i.e., had at least two of the following: fever, chest pain, cough, myalgia, shortness of breath, headache, or erythema nodosum/erythema multiforme rash) and laboratory confirmed (fourfold or greater increase rise in &lt;i&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/i&gt; serum complement fixation antibody titers taken at least 2 weeks apart). Eight patients met the criteria for having a case of probable histoplasmosis because their illness was clinically compatible, and they were epidemiologically linked to the patient with the confirmed case, even though the condition was not laboratory confirmed. In addition, three patients were suspected to have cases because although they each had only one clinically compatible finding (one with shortness of breath and two with headache), they were epidemiologically linked to the patient with the confirmed case.&lt;/p&gt;
