&lt;p&gt;We all know that regular walking is good for us, but information around step count goals can sometimes be confusing. Most people have heard of the 10,000 steps a day target by now, but a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2022 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that you can get significant health benefits from fewer steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which may leave you wondering, is there a lower limit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there are walking experts like Milica McDowell, a doctor of physical therapy, exercise physiologist, and VP of operations for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gaithappens.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://gaithappens.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Gait Happens&lt;/a&gt;, who are more than happy to share their expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell outlined the figures for me and explained why you should be worried if you’re walking fewer than 2,500 steps a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDowell’s advice is based on findings from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; that appeared in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.&lt;/em&gt; The research collected data from more than 250,000 participants over multiple years, meaning the findings can be reliably used to make informed recommendations by experts like McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this information motivates you to walk more to regularly hit that minimum, that’s great, but just make sure to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/how-do-you-increase-your-step-count-safely-an-exercise-physiologist-weighs-in"&gt;increase your step count safely&lt;/a&gt;—building up slowly over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-2-500-steps"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why 2,500 steps?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; mentioned above explains that you need to walk a minimum of 2,500-4,000 steps a day to see a reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GgGtB3NtSUZj35XNFS3srY" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-GgGtB3NtSUZj35XNFS3srY slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 2,337 steps a day, the risk of cardiovascular mortality specifically begins to reduce, so McDowell rounds that up to a more memorable 2,500 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular mortality encompasses all deaths caused by diseases of the cardiovascular system—your heart and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re walking fewer than 2,500 steps a day, your risk of heart disease, stroke and cardiovascular events is increased. Over 2,500 steps, those risks begin to decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“2,500 is the utter basement. If you’re lower than that, you are at risk for all sorts of horrible things,” says McDowell. “So, please get above 2,500. Most people take about 100 steps per minute, so 2,500 is roughly 25 minutes of walking per day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that all steps count—even getting something from another room—and this ambient walking, as it known, quickly adds up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-many-steps-should-you-aim-for"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How many steps should you aim for?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images / sdominick)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-000-to-4-000-steps-3"&gt;3,000 to 4,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If 2,500 is the absolute basement and you increase by 500 steps per day to 3,000, your risk of dying goes down 7%,” says McDowell. “If you go up 1,000 steps a day, from 2,500 to 3,500, you reduce your risk of dying by 15%.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; states that from around 3,867 steps a day, the risk of mortality from all causes&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;begins to reduce. This includes deaths from any illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-000-steps-3"&gt;5,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything under 5,000 steps a day is considered sedentary, with 5,000 to 7,500 classed as low activity. Other benefits kick in at 5,000, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that when we hit that 5,000 step mark, it’s very good for managing depression symptoms,” says McDowell. “So if you have a family history or if you’ve struggled with those conditions in the past, there are prescriptive amounts of walking that can reduce the symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://publichealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e48355/" target="_blank" data-url="https://publichealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e48355/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2024 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;JMIR Public Health and Surveillance&lt;/em&gt; found that walking can be used as “an evidence-based intervention for reducing anxiety and depression.” You might not be able to add walking to your list of medications, but a higher step count could make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s an important message because we know that anxiety, depression, and a lot of mental health disorders impact people’s longevity,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6-000-to-8-000-steps-3"&gt;6,000 to 8,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re older than 60, you should be aiming for between 6,000 and 8,000 steps a day for optimal health and longevity, after which the benefits stop increasing with the number of steps you walk. This recommendation is based on data from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;2022 &lt;em&gt;Lancet &lt;/em&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; exploring the benefits of walking for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you hit around the 7,000 mark, it’s good for reducing your risk of developing depression in the first place,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8-000-to-10-000-steps-3"&gt;8,000 to 10,000 steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are under 60 years old, the point of diminishing returns mentioned earlier is slightly higher, between 8,000 and 10,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking 8,000 steps at a moderate pace (about 3mph) will take you about 90 minutes to walk, depending on your stride length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, you don’t have to do that 90 minutes all in one go: you can break it up into smaller chunks like three 30-minute walks or three 20-minute walks and one 30-minute walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-walk-more"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to walk more&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked McDowell for her top tip to squeeze more steps into a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I encourage people to do micro walks,” she says. “They can go out for five minutes because most people walk at 100 steps per minute. So even five minutes can make a significant difference. And if we get them to add 10 minutes a day consistently, we’re looking at a significant impact on their longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-if-i-do-other-cardio-should-i-still-walk-for-health"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If I do other cardio should I still walk for health? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of my colleagues do other forms of exercise, and I wondered if doing more cardio exercise means you can skip hitting your steps that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rowing, biking and swimming are all good for you, but they don’t provide the specific &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/what-are-the-benefits-of-walking"&gt;benefits of walking&lt;/a&gt;. They surely provide other benefits, but your body needs a certain number of steps per day to achieve optimal health,” says McDowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-shop-walking-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shop walking shoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're in need of a new pair of walking shoes, our guide to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt; can help.

With fewer novel snapshots to store, the days collapse into something closer to a highlight reel than a feature film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to psychologist Marc Wittmann at the Institute for Frontier Areas of Psychology and Mental Health &lt;a href="https://igpp.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;(IGPP&lt;/a&gt;), the feeling that time accelerates is tightly linked to how much new material our brains record each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He points out that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-clutter-speeds-up-aging-in-the-brain/"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; and time perception sit on the same neural bench; when one slows, the other shrinks. “Newness” holds the key to this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-brain-and-time-perception"&gt;Human brain and time perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever a brain encounters something it has never processed before, a quick surge of attention flags the event as worth keeping. The more flags raised, the thicker the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;memory log&lt;/a&gt; becomes, and the longer that span later feels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids, still green to nearly everything, throw flags left and right. A lunchroom joke, a new word in science class, or a game of tag – each registers as its own small chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults often glide through copy-and-paste days that differ only by the date on the calendar. With fewer chapters recorded, the book of any given week reads as a short story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research using immersive virtual reality in 2024 showed that older volunteers underestimated simple time intervals by roughly 15 percent, highlighting how novelty &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S096800042300302X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sharpens the inner clock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine doesn’t just compress the past; it also drains the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies tracking holiday seasons in several countries found that people who stuck to predictable daily rhythms felt that Christmas or Ramadan arrived sooner every year, while those who sprinkled in new activities reported a slower march toward the festivities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-processing-speed-linked-with-time"&gt;Brain processing speed linked with time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sensation has to travel from eye or ear to cortex. In youngsters, those &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/speech-pattern-wfd-that-is-a-clear-indication-a-person-is-in-cognitive-decline/"&gt;neural highways&lt;/a&gt; are short and well-paved. As bodies grow, the routes lengthen, and the conduction speed though still quick can’t match its earlier zip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add natural age-related slowing of signal processing and the brain starts sampling the world less often each second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fewer samples mean fewer “ticks” on the subjective stopwatch, so a morning meeting seems to vanish faster for a forty-year-old than for a fourth grader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sampling &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-link-pupil-dilation-to-brains-working-memory-levels/"&gt;shows up in the eyes&lt;/a&gt;. Our eyes jerk from point to point in rapid saccades, pausing in brief fixations while the brain grabs a visual frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young, rested eyes squeeze in more fixations per minute. Older or fatigued eyes lag, offering the brain fewer still frames to stitch together. With a thinner film strip, the projection of the day speeds along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists studying eye movements liken perception to a flipbook. Each fixation is a page; flip them fast enough and you see smooth action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fixations slow, the flipbook loses pages. Motion still appears, but the storyline gets choppy, and, in recall, it shortens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-and-alertness"&gt;Sleep and alertness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single night of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-can-boost-memory-in-a-surprising-way/"&gt;good sleep&lt;/a&gt; can pull the brake on runaway days. When neurons are well-rested, they fire faster, notice more, and form clearer memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes know the flip side: stepping onto the field after too little shut-eye makes the whole match blur. The plays happen, but the mind records only a highlight or two before the final whistle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students grinding through an all-nighter meet the same fate – an exam that seems to finish moments after it starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/what-is-the-best-treatment-for-excessive-daytime-sleepiness/"&gt;Chronic fatigue&lt;/a&gt; magnifies the effect. Continually short-changing rest lowers baseline alertness, trimming snapshots day after day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over months, life can feel like it’s slipping through the cracks, not because the clock sped up but because the recorder slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/dopamine-the-pathway-to-pleasure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dopamine&lt;/a&gt;, a neurotransmitter tied to motivation and time estimation, also dips with sleep debt, further warping the &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1364166/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sense of duration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endless feeds promise variety, yet most algorithms serve look-alike posts. Swipe through video after video of the same dance trend, and the brain barely registers a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours evaporate while the memory log remains nearly blank. Compound that with the blue-light-induced bedtime delay, and you have a double punch: fewer snapshots captured and fewer hours slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back on passive scrolling or swapping it for an activity with genuine novelty – trying a new recipe, learning a chord on guitar – feeds the brain more distinct moments. Those moments stretch subjective time, turning a blur of an evening into something that feels full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-with-age-comes-responsibility"&gt;With age comes responsibility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond slower processing, adults juggle long lists of responsibilities. Focus narrows to tasks at hand – emails, errands, budgets – scanning less of the environment for new input. Novelty drops, and subjective days shorten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiaa.org/public/institute/publication/2023/young-adults-their-attitudes-and-outlook-toward-retirement-and-the-future" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A 2023 survey&lt;/a&gt; comparing young adults with retirees found that the older group reported the year as “rushing by” nearly twice as often, linking the feeling to the predictability of daily routines rather than to health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, not every senior feels the rush. Researchers tracking so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/4-habits-super-agers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;super-agers&lt;/a&gt;” note that those who keep learning new skills and staying socially engaged maintain sharper senses of time, along with stronger memory performance. Variety keeps the brain’s camera clicking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-use-your-brain-to-slow-time-perception"&gt;Use your brain to slow time perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news – the tools to lengthen your days fit into ordinary life. Go to bed on a schedule that honors the seven-to-nine-hour rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan at least one activity each week that forces you out of autopilot: a different jogging route, a museum you’ve never visited, a new language app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doing it, pay close attention to sights, sounds, and textures. Engagement packs extra snapshots into the mental album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay curious daily. Swap a lunchtime scroll for a short walk and notice five things you’ve never clocked before – a mural, a bird call, the scent of a bakery vent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those micro-discoveries add pages to the flipbook, expanding the subjective afternoon. Over time, the habit can “thicken” the memory book that tells the story of a year, making December feel like it belongs twelve full months away, right where the calendar says it should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/why-the-days-seem-shorter-as-we-get-older/2CB8EC9B0B30537230C7442B826E42F1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;European Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 23:45:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPNTNRaXFET2w2MkRxWHRsLTU1Qjl4QllUeWZvQzE2NVJyOElIUE1jUnI5VmlmSDVRV0t6endfZEtLbExDWHJxYnFsVHNQa2FYT1ZGSktFbC1VSlB0R2N6dVV2cE9NdnFBdmNfR2ZHeDhUUlAyRFV6NDVHakc2eXNCUk5wN05LYmpsNTQ3VFdmNU5OQ3dwVXMyd1N4WTN3Skt0bk1JSjBmdUZZc3NaV3Jv</guid></item><item><title>这棵流行树的叶子可以改善血液循环并防止血栓- Earth.com | Leaves from this popular tree may improve circulation and prevent blood clots - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxONnBNaDY3VV9zOVd4M2tWNUJkLUE0YVFVb1QtZmR6Zjg1T0ZvX2dBbDNudmhxSjJmLWJZWnBtemhyd2wzaDA0WXprOGxRSktmRnZIWjF3NDQ5dlg3aXFRcUI1U2o4VTJVQmRtd0Q4Y0lucU05UHNvT2tLcHBEaFZEWUtvcnFwbXZROTJQYkxtYlpvdFRfMFNhSm5KZWlrMWND?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Varicose veins bulge and twist across the calves of up to 30 percent of adults, a reminder that blood sometimes pools instead of flowing home to the heart. When sluggish blood flow lingers, clots can form and, in rare cases, travel to the lungs or brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centuries ago physicians in China brewed teas from &lt;a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/PlantFinder/PlantFinderDetails.aspx?kempercode=z990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ginkgo biloba&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; leaves to sharpen memory. Today researchers wonder whether the same ginkgo leaves might support weary leg veins and cut the risk of small, yet dangerous, blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-circulation-can-falter"&gt;Why circulation can falter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood rising from the feet must fight gravity, and faulty valves can leave veins stretched and valves leaky. The lingering pressure distends vein walls, encourages &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fasting-helps-the-body-fight-inflammation-and-chronic-diseases/"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and slows platelet aggregation, the first step toward clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow venous return creates the setting for deep‑vein thrombosis as well as the aching, throbbing symptoms many patients feel after a day of standing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That overlap has pushed vascular specialists toward plant‑based compounds that might tone the vein wall and limit sticky platelets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After logging stroke cases at Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing, neurologist &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Xiangqian-Huang-2265510495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Xiangqian Huang&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://ccmu.cucas.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Capital Medical University&lt;/a&gt; began probing ginkgo’s effects on clot behavior in the brain, work that now informs leg‑vein research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ginkgo-leaves-and-blood-flow"&gt;Ginkgo leaves and blood flow&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginkgo extract made &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;blood platelets&lt;/a&gt; less sticky when triggered by one type of chemical but didn’t have much effect when triggered by another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Xiangqian Huang and the team also noticed that blood took slightly longer to clot after treatment with the extract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leaf contains natural compounds that seem to interact with enzymes responsible for forming clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2025 animal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40462336/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers found that ginkgo reduced damage inside blood vessels in rats with clotting problems and slightly increased the time it took for their blood to clot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-insights-from-a-beijing-stroke-ward"&gt;Insights from a Beijing stroke ward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huang’s real‑world study followed 99 patients for five days. Among stroke survivors who received ginkgo plus baby &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-aspirin-use-strongly-tied-to-colorectal-cancer-prevention/"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt;, arachidonic‑acid platelet aggregation fell more than in peers on aspirin alone, while major bleeding did not rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minor nose or gum bleeds surfaced in four of thirty‑three combination patients, a signal that enhanced anticoagulation deserves monitoring. No severe hemorrhages occurred, suggesting short‑term safety when doses stay low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design also enrolled participants with internal jugular venous stenosis, a group whose &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/artificial-sweetener-erythritol-sugar-substitute-linked-to-blood-clots-heart-disease/"&gt;clots&lt;/a&gt; mirror those in leg veins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that arm ginkgo alone curbed blood platelet stickiness within 24 hours, and the effect held steady through day five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aspirin-ginkgo-and-blood-clots"&gt;Aspirin, ginkgo, and blood clots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17982321/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scientists&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/christopher-gardner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Christopher Gardner&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford Department of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; examined the potential adverse effects of concomitant aspirin and Ginkgo biloba on blood platelet function after giving the duo to older adults for four weeks. The worry was that the herbs might blunt or boost common drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner and colleagues detected no dangerous bleeding, yet laboratory tests showed additive platelet inhibition, suggesting that low‑dose pairings could protect high‑risk patients who cannot tolerate stronger pharmaceuticals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors, however, should adjust regimens around surgeries or when other blood thinners enter the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the leaf targets arachidonic‑acid pathways that aspirin already touches, the partnership makes pharmacologic sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, anyone taking nonsteroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs should discuss timing and dosage to avoid stacking identical mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-helping-legs-feel-lighter"&gt;Helping legs feel lighter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep veins are not the only place where endothelial cells detach under strain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a classic double‑blind trial, scientists found that a capsule combining ginkgo, troxerutin, and heptaminol cut circulating endothelial cell counts by 14.5 percent in patients with chronic varicose veins, placebo achieved only 8.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26848/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Endothelial cells&lt;/a&gt; are early barometers of vein injury, so their decline hints at real structural healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also reported reduced ankle swelling and night cramps, benefits echoed by later Russian and Italian studies that tracked leg circumference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/phl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phlebology&lt;/a&gt; still relies on compression stockings and laser ablation, yet many sufferers ask for gentler first steps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standardized ginkgo formula, already licensed for vascular disorders in parts of Europe, may slot neatly between lifestyle changes and invasive procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blood-clot-prevention-with-ginkgo"&gt;Blood clot prevention with ginkgo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang’s rat data showed lighter &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cause-of-strokes-cervical-artery-dissection-has-increased-400-percent-since-2005/"&gt;clots&lt;/a&gt;, higher nitric‑oxide levels, and longer clotting times after gavage with 60 milligrams per kilogram of extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitric oxide relaxes vessel walls and counters platelet stickiness, aligning with human data from stroke and vein clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26030402/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Network‑pharmacology&lt;/a&gt; maps place AKT1, ALB, and TNF at the center of ginkgo’s target web. Those same genes regulate inflammation, suggesting that the tree’s reach extends beyond platelets to the very lining of our veins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because oxidative stress weakens venous valves, the antioxidant side of the extract warrants equal attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavonols scavenge free radicals, potentially slowing the progressive dilation that makes early spider veins blossom into rope‑like cords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-talking-with-your-doctor"&gt;Talking with your doctor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ginkgo supplements crowd store shelves, yet extracts used in clinical trials are highly standardized.

&lt;p&gt;Groundbreaking research by the University of Sydney has identified a new brain protein involved in the development of Parkinson’s disease and a way to modify it, paving the way for future treatments for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aim of finding new treatments to slow or stop its progression, the research team has spent more than a decade studying the biological mechanisms underpinning the condition—which is the second most common neurological condition after dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, they identified for the first time the presence of an abnormal form of a protein—called SOD1—in the brains of patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, the SOD1 protein provides protective benefits to the brain, but in Parkinson’s patients it becomes faulty, causing the protein to clump and damage brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest study by the same team, led by Professor Kay Double from the Brain and Mind Centre, &lt;a href="https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-025-02048-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was just published&lt;/a&gt; in Acta Neuropathologica Communications. It found that targeting the faulty SOD1 protein with a drug treatment using copper improved the motor function in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hoped that by treating this malfunctioning protein, we might be able to improve the Parkinson-like symptoms in the mice we were treating – but even we were astonished by the success of the intervention,” said Professor Double&lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2025/06/26/targeting-newly-identified-brain-protein-brings-hope-of-new-parkinsons-disease-treatment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; in a media release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All the mice we treated saw a dramatic improvement in their motor skills, which is a really promising sign that it could be effective in treating people who have Parkinson disease too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a title="First Advanced Parkinson’s Patient to Walk Again with New Spinal Implant, ‘It’s Incredible’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/first-advanced-parkinsons-patient-to-walk-again-with-new-spinal-implant-its-incredible/" rel="bookmark"&gt;First Advanced Parkinson’s Patient to Walk Again with New Spinal Implant, ‘It’s Incredible’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved two groups of mice with Parkinson-like symptoms. One group was treated with a special copper supplement for three months, while the other received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the study (which was partly funded by the Michael J. Fox Foundation), the mice receiving only the placebo saw a decline in their motor symptoms. The mice receiving the special copper supplement, however, did not develop movement problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The results were beyond our expectations,” said Prof. Double. “They suggest, once further studies are carried out, this treatment approach could slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At present there is no known cure and only limited treatments for Parkinson’s disease, which is a degenerative disorder in which dopamine-producing cells in the brain die, leading to a range of symptoms including tremors, muscle stiffness, slow movement and impaired balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But researchers hope understanding the causes of the disease will lead to improved treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE GOOD NEWS FOR PATIENTS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As our understanding of Parkinson’s disease grows, we are finding that there are many factors contributing to its development and progression in humans – and faulty forms of the SOD1 protein is likely one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just as researchers found with HIV, Parkinson’s disease is a complex condition that likely requires multiple interventions. A single treatment may have a small effect when used alone but, when combined with other interventions, contributes to a significant overall improvement in health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ next step is to identify the best approach to targeting the faulty SOD1 protein in a clinical trial, which could be the start of a new therapy to slow the development of Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We are a nation of snackers: Most U.S. adults &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7893359/easy-healthy-snacks-for-anytime-of-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat at least one snack every day&lt;/a&gt;. Snacking is so significant, data suggests snacks contribute to approximately 20% of most adults’ total calorie intake per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It isn’t hard to find a snack that tastes good. From chips to chocolate, a tasty nosh is easy to come by. But it can be challenging to find the perfect snack that balances both taste and nutrition. Specifically, finding a snack that checks two important boxes—high in protein and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good for gut health&lt;/a&gt;—can feel like a tough task.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this article, we'll explore a gastroenterologist’s top pick for a high-protein snack that is fantastic for your gut health—and tastes great to boot! Whether you're looking for something to fuel your workout, tide you over between meals or simply improve your digestive system, we've got you covered.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-choosing-healthy-snacks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Choosing Healthy Snacks &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Choosing the right snacks can offer many potential health perks, from helping alleviate potential digestive health concerns to adding important nutrients to your diet.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The key is to choose snacks that actually empower our health rather than the ones that zap our energy and ruin our afternoon,” says &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/learn/dr-will-bulsiewicz" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist and U.S. medical director of Zoe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The perfect way to accomplish this? Bulsiewicz&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;says to look for choices that are considered both high in protein and fiber. “This is the ideal combination for satiation, meaning less 'hangry' with a happy, satisfied tummy. Both protein and fiber &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053298/best-nutrient-for-weight-loss-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;stimulate GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; release, the natural version of Ozempic,” he says. How so? Fiber feeds gut bacteria, producing anti-inflammatory chemicals that stimulate the release of this natural hormone in our bodies, Bulsiewicz explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Published research conducted by Zoe shows that consuming lower-quality, ultraprocessed snacks that have little fiber and protein, like candy or cookies, is associated with higher triglycerides, worse blood sugar control and more hunger. Snacks that are minimally processed, like fresh fruit and vegetables, nuts and seeds, however, had the opposite effect, says Bulsiewicz. “This study proves that snacking is in no way bad, but when you snack you want to choose high-quality snacks,” he says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-best-snack-is-edamame"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Best Snack is Edamame &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;When looking for a high-protein snack that supports gut health, there are some snacks that check both of those boxes. When we asked Bulsiewicz for his top pick, he was happy to share that &lt;strong&gt;edamame&lt;/strong&gt; is the best high-protein snack for better gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why edamame? The young, tender soybeans are “inexpensive, delicious and snacking on a cup delivers 18 grams of protein and 8 grams of fiber tightly squeezed into just 188 calories,” Bulsiewicz says. He also points out that this snack may help keep you full to support weight-management goals because of its protein and fiber content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; His go-to way for preparing edamame is to purchase frozen edamame pods, pour them into a microwave-safe bowl with 2 tablespoons of water at the bottom, seal it and microwave for 3 to 4 minutes. “Add a sprinkle of salt for flavor. You can go with sea salt, but next level would be flaky Maldon salt,” he recommends. Dusting them with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/262111/edamame-with-aleppo-pepper/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Aleppo pepper &lt;/a&gt;is a nice option, too. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Preliminary evidence suggests that soy protein may have noteworthy effects on gut health. For example, research on animals showed positive effects on the gut microbiota when soy protein was consumed.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Data on postmenopausal women also found that intake of soy isoflavones (compounds found in soybeans that have estrogen-like properties) may be linked to beneficial changes in gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Edamame can also be enjoyed as a hummus or as an ingredient in falafel. An alternative option is dry-roasted edamame, which can be found in a variety of flavors prepackaged in the snack aisle in many stores. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Research shows that, when digesting almonds, the body produces butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that serves as the primary energy source for colon cells, promoting a healthy colon lining.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

												&lt;p&gt;Andhra Pradesh's Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department is launching a focused "smart mosquito control" programme using deep technology to check vector-borne diseases. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Artificial Intelligence-powered Smart Mosquito Surveillance System (SMoSS) will be launched on a pilot basis at 66 locations in six major municipal corporations in the state, the department announced on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SMoSS will primarily safeguard public health by curbing the dreaded mosquito menace, and it will also reduce operational burden on civic staff and cut costs of Urban Local Bodies, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The programme will be closely and effectively monitored with the help of Internet-of-Things like drones, sensors, heat maps and traps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pilot will soon be launched at 16 locations in the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, four in Kakinada, five in Rajamahendravaram, 28 in Vijayawada, seven in Nellore, and six in Kurnool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MAUD's Principal Secretary, S. Suresh Kumar, and Director of Municipal Administration, P. Sampath Kumar, recently studied the AI-powered SMoSS, developed by a private agency, to assess its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI-powered smart mosquito sensors will be installed in key mosquito-prone zones in the selected urban local bodies as part of the pilot project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These smart sensors will detect the mosquito species, their gender, density, temperature and humidity. SMoSS will trigger automatic alerts when mosquito density crosses a threshold level in any particular area. Data thus generated will be continuously streamed to a central server and visualised on a real-time dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"This will enable close monitoring and ensure prompt fumigation in the affected areas in a data-driven approach for effective control of mosquitoes instead of the present ‘blind spraying’ process that has little impact. The IoT sensors will monitor mosquito density and guide the targeted activity," an official said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of drones for spraying the larvicide would result in an efficient application by covering large areas with less chemical use, time, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence-based spraying, prevention of chemical overuse and promotion of public health safety are the key elements in the whole operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We will be outsourcing the operations completely to specialised agencies, and payment will be result-oriented by fixing operational accountability. Complaints, if any, from the citizens and field-level functionaries will be tracked via mobile applications (Vector Control and Puramitra),” they said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system is also being put in place for reporting daily on cases like malaria, dengue and chikungunya from hospitals. Based on the data, mosquito hotspots will be identified for focused action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special action plans are being drawn for scheduled fogging and larval treatment in hotspots, the officials added.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Mohammed Enayat is a London-based GP and the Founder of HUM2N Longevity Clinic. Here, he walks us through how he structures his day, making simple tweaks to his diet and lifestyle, to ensure he lives a longer, healthier life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Wake up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m up at 6am every day and the first thing I do is take myself out to the garden to do some breathing. I live with my parents in their house in north-east London at the moment, and they’re lucky enough to have a lovely garden. I moved in with them 18 months ago just as I was opening my longevity clinic HUM2N. It made sense financially for me as I was setting up my business, but they’re also in their mid-70s now and being there means I can spend more quality time with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m getting married this summer and then I’ll split my time between my parents’ and my future wife’s, who lives on the Kent coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once I’m outside, I’ll do breathing exercises or pray for a few minutes, but just putting my bare feet on the ground helps me to wake up. Even when it’s been raining!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, I’ll brush my teeth and hop in the shower. Only then do I switch my mind to work, looking at my phone and checking emails and messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Breakfast: 0 calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rarely eat breakfast because I’ve worked out I feel more energised when I do &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/intermittent-fasting-benefits-downsides-weight-loss/"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;. So I’ll have my last meal of the day by 8.30pm, and then my first meal at lunch. It means I’m &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/weight-loss/fasting-versus-low-carb/"&gt;carbohydrate free&lt;/a&gt; for the whole morning, so biologically, I’m in a fasted state five days a week. When you haven’t eaten for 10-12 hours, glycogen stores in the liver become depleted, and so your body begins breaking down protein and fat stores for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I leave for work, I’ll take my morning supplements with some water. I’m always adjusting the amount and the ones I take depending on what my body needs. I take up to eight some days, but others I don’t take any at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have annual blood tests taken at my own clinic that help me decide on which supplements to take. These tests aren’t typically available on the NHS, but will look at an extensive list of 120 biomarkers that indicate what’s going on in our bodies &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; from our immune system to our hormones and digestive health &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; and identify areas of health that need attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m 41 now, and I do think your 40s can be a slippery slope in terms of health, which is why the annual blood test is worth doing. People don’t become sick overnight. There are silent things that can accumulate in the body and if you can catch these as early as possible, you can do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This turns medicine on its head a bit, because we’re not looking to treat an individual symptom or organ, we’re looking to treat a whole human. As a doctor, I find I can improve people’s health much better when I’m looking at all of their systems together, rather than in bits and pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Annual blood tests inform my morning supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time I had my blood tests taken, I discovered elevated levels of the protein zonulin in my blood, indicating I have a leaky gut at the moment. That’s where the lining of the small intestine becomes damaged, allowing bacteria, toxins, and undigested food particles to leak into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So now I’m on a supplement plan that contains L-glutamine, digestive enzymes, and &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/probiotics-gut-health/"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also removed dairy from my diet for now as it was flagged as one of the leaky gut drivers for me. I’ve noticed that my bloating has gone down and the dry skin I was also experiencing has gone away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood test also showed that I have adrenal fatigue too, and that my stress responding hormones aren’t working as well as they should be. Symptoms that people can look out for are feeling “wired but tired”, getting colds and flus more often, and feeling generally run down. As well as taking supplements to help with this, I’m being more mindful of my workload, and making sure I’m bringing down my cortisol levels in the evening with a few minutes of meditation or deep breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m also taking peptides to support tissue repair and recovery as I’m doing a lot of strength training ahead of my wedding. One of these peptides is called BPC 157, and the other is called Ipamorelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;My commute&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I commute on the Central Line from my parent’s home to my clinic in South Kensington and it takes about an hour. I’ll listen to podcasts on the way. At the moment I’ve been listening to Robin Sharma, humanitarian, author of &lt;em&gt;The Wealth Money Can’t Buy&lt;/em&gt;, which I enjoyed a lot. I’ll also plan for the day ahead by taking notes or journaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have my first coffee at around 9am, before starting my day at work. Every day is different, and I have some days where I’m seeing back-to-back clinical patients, and then some that are full of management meetings with my team. I try to take some of those meetings as walking meetings so that I can get my steps up, and get some more daylight and fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love my patient time because I love working with people. I do a day a week as a GP with the NHS, so most weeks I’m working six days. Within the week, I also spend about 20 per cent of time educating my team and leading in-house learning with different specialists and building out our team of experts. It’s full on, but I feel like I have important work to do that will hopefully help people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How I make time to exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At lunchtime, I take an hour and a half break and go for strength and conditioning training at a nearby gym which, at the moment, is focused on my core and posterior strength development. I’d started to get some back pain from being quite sedentary. It’s not too bad yet, but I wanted to prevent it from becoming a bigger issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m getting married in August, which is really motivating me to get fitter and healthier, because that can slip when you’re busy. I’ve got my sights set on a really nicely-fitted suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also do boxing once or twice a week, and that’s my cardio. My training regime does tend to vary. I love to be outside when I can, so in the warmer months I’ll do my boxing and circuits outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the days that I’m not commuting, I try to go for a run outside or do some skipping. You should always make time to move your body, it’s one of the most important things you can do for your mental and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Snack: 185 calories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I feel like I need something to keep me going until lunchtime, I’ll have a smoothie with blueberries, a scoop of almond butter, 22g of collagen protein, greens powder, oat milk and water.&lt;/p&gt;

Breakfast skipping was also associated with anxiety, but the strength of this association was negligible. The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1574119"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is the first meal of the day, typically eaten in the morning after a night’s sleep. People around the world eat different foods for breakfast depending on culture, tradition, and availability. In many Western countries, breakfast includes eggs, toast, cereal, fruit, or yogurt. In East Asia, breakfast often consists of rice, soup, pickled vegetables, or steamed buns. Some people prefer a light breakfast like a smoothie or coffee, while others opt for a hearty meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breakfast is considered important because it helps replenish energy and provides essential nutrients after a long overnight fast. Studies have shown that eating breakfast can improve concentration, memory, and academic performance in children. It may also help regulate metabolism and support healthy weight management. Skipping breakfast has been associated with an increased risk of overeating later in the day and poorer overall diet quality. For many, breakfast is also a time to begin the day with a moment of calm or connection with family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Stephanie Ming Yin Wong and her colleagues aimed to explore patterns of breakfast consumption among youth in Hong Kong and to investigate the associations between breakfast skipping, impulsivity, and symptoms of depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed data from the Hong Kong Youth Epidemiological Study of Mental Health (HK-YES), the first territory-wide household-based mental health study in Hong Kong specifically targeting young people aged 15 to 24. Data were collected between 2019 and 2022. Fifty-eight percent of participants were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis included data from 3,154 participants, with an average age of 20 years. Participants answered questions about their breakfast habits and completed assessments of impulsivity (using the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale–11), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire–9), anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale–7), and overall functioning (measured by self-reported productivity loss due to mental health problems and an interviewer-rated Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results showed that 85% of participants consumed breakfast either daily or intermittently, while 15% regularly skipped breakfast. Individuals who skipped breakfast tended to be slightly more impulsive, particularly in terms of attentional control and self-control. They also reported slightly more severe depressive symptoms and marginally higher anxiety symptoms. Compared to peers who ate breakfast, those who skipped it reported just under one additional day of reduced productivity per month and slightly poorer social and occupational functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Breakfast skipping is associated with elevated depressive symptoms in young people, with impaired attentional control being an important mechanism in this relationship. Encouraging young people to build regular breakfast habits may be incorporated as part of future lifestyle interventions for mental disorders and be further emphasized in public health policies,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between breakfast-related habits and mental health. However, it should be noted that the reported associations were all very weak and detectable only because the sample was very large.

Along the way, I might stop to talk with other patients who share my time slot or with Freddy Mancilla, who restocks the hospital gowns and water bottles; he has worked at Sibley for 39 years, and his fellow staff members dote on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2RCHCYMTJNBHLEV6VWB6UUEFHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I get into the radiation room, I recite my name and birth date and disrobe as required for the body parts in question.

I have yet to see a patient treated rudely or to hear an argument among the staff. There is, however, a lot of good-natured teasing and laughing. Coordinating this complex ballet falls to Terelle Cook, Sibley’s chief radiation therapist manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XHZZ65LPCRFXBLTGTX7ZFWJW5A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“How do you build a team like ours?” Fung Mei Chiang, one of my regular therapists, responds when I ask. “Through a lot of mutual respect.

For many patients, the small daily interactions with the therapists help ease what can be a disheartening experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QQICXFI53VCBRJJF5YD2DBTGWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As the therapists push and prod my body, we usually banter. “We see people every day for weeks on end,” therapist Myla Bennette tells me, “and so we get to know a little bit about you guys, and you get to know a little bit about us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GHUR7LS6E5AEVIICLRXP27AOO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During my radiation weeks, I’ve had mini-conversations about films and restaurants, families and future plans, and about life on the front lines of health care. One day, I asked how they learned to handle patients’ bodies with a detached professionalism — while still treating us like humans — and how they learned to deal with the inevitable deaths of so many of the people they treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EXAMY5P22FD3LDZLPUAUEX47AM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;They cited extensive classroom training and clinical practice rotations, but life experience and empathy also play a role. Many of them came to the profession after caring for a loved one with a mortal illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4Y4ZMURD5FC5FHAQCVKHFW7CVQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Once the therapists have me perfectly aligned for treatment, they leave me and head for the control desk outside. Lying on the bed of the radiation machine, with darting red and green beams above me and large mechanical eyes and grids humming and moving around me, I feel as though I’m in a 1950s sci-fi movie, slightly cheesy and cool at the same time. Make that cold. The machines get finicky at warmer temperatures; for most patients, a highlight of treatment is when they cover you with a nice warm blanket. Then you can concentrate on, or ignore, whatever soundtrack happens to be playing and stare at the photos of tulips on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RYSGNLVBAVHDHPKEFGYERAPF6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;My radiation treatment didn’t hurt, although you do have to lie very still. For the lung nodule, I had to suck on a tube that looked like a snorkel, then hold my breath for a bit longer than seemed comfortable. But, for the rest, I just had to maintain whatever awkward position would put the X-rays in line with the delinquent cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MQHD5ECVAFFAHORJOP5X5UPDOQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Then it’s over. The therapists come back in and liberate me. We wish each other a good day. And it’s back to the real world. Until next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 14:01:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOQmY4dUlwczhBSE8ybE1fUTRSWTNiZWdRMXNXNlJBMlZxcURwb0VYNUhCaGdybmhCNmVfMHhIcVd1Q284Rlpha0dSSkNtZ3d5d0NScDE5M1dfMHJMMGplR1VMNXc3SV9RT3lMNE5OUjJwRnJfVUN6cFJCcENIQWRzWXV4MFppV2lXQ3JVUzRMTGJVR1R0QUE</guid></item><item><title>在重新与老朋友在线联系之前，问问自己这些问题-《华盛顿邮报》 | Before you reconnect with an old friend online, ask yourself these questions - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOV28xZUE1UzJSa19jc2JBMzJRckk4TjFxUnplLWVRcUlQUDZ6TXB3UWRCT1JpQVpFLWxNSVlRSW8yR1hEN3lfSGNYMkxhYy1IckFURUJReG82dHlQcjc2bGdwd0oyOUdqUjNpMUhzNlY3T1Vid25HN2lVMXpza0kzQlFXSDl3RnFzb1B0U3hyQ2hzUWZTTk1hYXhFQVc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4ZBYKVAGEVGZPBM6ACHOPU4GFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I was scrolling mindlessly through Facebook when I saw it: A decade-old friend request had suddenly been accepted. My heart raced. This once-dear friend had ended our relationship years ago, and I had been deeply wounded. But now I wondered whether reconnecting was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SMAL7I3HWJEVLIHD2KO3QFT5I4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research &lt;a href="https://news.ku.edu/news/article/2018/03/06/study-reveals-number-hours-it-takes-make-friend" target="_blank"&gt;has shown that it takes&lt;/a&gt; over 200 hours to make a close friend, and even longer as we get older. By contrast, reuniting with a former pal can be just a few keystrokes away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LTHT2WBJEZFKTI5PU23UUSOCFQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But not so fast. A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/04/240423155530.htm" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that reuniting with old friends is often just as tricky as creating new relationships and, sometimes, more so. That reassuring sense of familiarity can be a trap. After all, people change — old friends may not be who they once were; nor, for that matter, are we.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="54DK3BPYRJF5HCWU5BAE5HJGJQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="54DK3BPYRJF5HCWU5BAE5HJGJQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;A chance to reflect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IIDPKO3PIRBM7PVD47G2HHHJMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6441127/" target="_blank"&gt;physical and emotional benefits&lt;/a&gt; of enduring friendship have been well chronicled, reconnecting after a long period apart raises questions: Is the prospect of a new connection a chance to revive a lost friendship, or an opportunity to reflect on our values and priorities and what we want out of friendship today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CS4CSNTOGRHZJPFFYS2QEAT56Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sometimes, for instance, we want to reconnect only to expunge a feeling of failure for having lost a friendship in the first place, which is misguided, says Naama Hofman, an assistant professor&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OZ45W67YIRC2ZGVFZDSIFCA464" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Certain friendships symbolize a specific time of life. Letting go can help you understand where you stand now,” Hofman said. “The most important question to answer is not what went wrong when a connection was severed, but what can be gained by restoring it,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NYMHIY47DJH27CSQGXDZQUNDPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Friendships are not meant to be eternal, researchers say. They wax and wane as we pass through the seasons of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BRWCRKDBYNHTLA3VI5RRWMUMUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“As we go through life transitions, our values and priorities shift, and so do our friendships,” Hofman said. “Young adults might use friendship for information and to engage in the world, whereas later in life you might focus on people who really get you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3FCQSROADBG6ZCDGKIU36QHIEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But while friend-shedding is inevitable, it also may be an opportunity. “Transitions can be a time where you rethink what kind of friendships you want,” she added. “Earlier in life, you might not have been able to form the kind of relationships you craved, but now maybe you can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="X3OAZP3VPBDBHBIZ6FFA35MB3I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="X3OAZP3VPBDBHBIZ6FFA35MB3I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to consider&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EOXUW76DZNDW3DOY7SHXI62DH4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, what are the things you should keep in mind when reconnecting?

He had ended our relationship because his wife found my status as a divorced, single woman threatening. At the time, losing my best male friend at the same moment as my marriage felt like a cruel twist. But he has been eager and willing to make the repairs necessary to reestablish a friendship. I had forgotten how much he makes me laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGY4LYN6ZBEHJGE4YWFMXF24EA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the same time, I sense the thrilling possibilities of discovering something deeper and richer as mature adults in our 50s. It’s not that the old hurt and betrayal surrounding our lost friendship have entirely disappeared, but they have become part of a shared history on which we are building something new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 13:31:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOV28xZUE1UzJSa19jc2JBMzJRckk4TjFxUnplLWVRcUlQUDZ6TXB3UWRCT1JpQVpFLWxNSVlRSW8yR1hEN3lfSGNYMkxhYy1IckFURUJReG82dHlQcjc2bGdwd0oyOUdqUjNpMUhzNlY3T1Vid25HN2lVMXpza0kzQlFXSDl3RnFzb1B0U3hyQ2hzUWZTTk1hYXhFQVc</guid></item><item><title>我有一个在夏天不发臭的小秘诀-石板 | I Have a Little Secret for Not Stinking in the Summer - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxQd3dYaEh4bUR5MGJ5QzFodThHYlcwdnBlM2ZtSVkzT2QyMDJ3MWRMWExQV181QTh2NUl2Mzh0X2N2aVRGc0RFWmdtczRwQm5lNGVuX2FBVkFSUm1iaXAweUlRYUZIVHVpZngtdndrNUxVejFPVHI1dHA4eFFiY3RMYg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;
          &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnj71t8000w3b7712r2tm8m@published"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/tag/one-thing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Thing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a column with tips on how to live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcniqoak001fgem47gm2hf8a@published"&gt;Let’s be honest, we’re all sweating this summer. It’s hot, it’s sticky, and the days are long. The cool gusts of fall air are months away. Luckily, I’ve found something that helps freshen me up in seconds flat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnj75sm00143b779r5umvjp@published"&gt;My friend Kate hipped me to the multitude of uses for this product, and now, I don’t travel without it. I can’t. I won’t. It’s not fancy, expensive, or procured overseas. You can find it at your local drugstore or retail chain. It’s: spray deodorant!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnj75sn00153b77qidhrtzg@published"&gt;You can apply it to your armpits, of course, but I even spritz it on top of my clothes in the armpit area when I haven’t had a chance to shower in a while. Yes, I add it &lt;em&gt;over &lt;/em&gt;the outfit, like a perfume (if your pits wore perfume). Or, it adds an extra layer of protection directly to the underarm when you are out and need a reset.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnj75sn00163b77l4usoxci@published"&gt;In colder weather, you can even try it on the inside of a sweater or a coat after you schvitz too much. I spray the stuff on the soft inner lining of my favorite non-washable jacket, and the body odor is gone—although I can’t guarantee this will go well for all fabrics, so tread lightly and test before dousing anything important.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnj75sn00173b773oz5fouh@published"&gt;I prefer &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0012HCCNI/?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;Weleda Wild Rose Deodorant Spray&lt;/a&gt;, with the old-school pump. My scent becomes transformed from “whoa there” to “herbaceous rose garden.” And who doesn’t want to smell like miles of woody perennials? Deodorant is &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/06/rise-of-all-natural-deodorants-not-necessary-sweating-antiperspirant.html"&gt;unlike an antiperspirant&lt;/a&gt; because it only aims to improve your smell, not block sweating. The one I use comes out clear, which is important if you’re spraying it around willy-nilly, as I do (although the packaging says&lt;em&gt; don’t&lt;/em&gt; use it as an air freshener—this stuff is not meant for universal application or inhalation).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnj75sn00183b776987vmrw@published"&gt;Regardless, I would like to extend a big, non-sweaty thank you to my dear friend Kate. This natural spray deodorant has changed my life, or at least the way I &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;smell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The ultraviolet or near‑ultraviolet lamps that harden glossy manicure coatings do the job in about four minutes, so the routine feels harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dryers bathe fingertips in swift pulses of light, but until recently few people asked what those pulses do to the skin that holds the nails. A new laboratory study brings unsettling answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work was led by photochemist &lt;a href="https://bicyt.conicet.gov.ar/fichas/p/en/maria-laura-dantola" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. María Laura Dántola&lt;/a&gt; at the Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physical‑Chemical Research &lt;a href="https://www.inifta.unlp.edu.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;(INIFTA&lt;/a&gt;), part of Argentina’s National Scientific and Technical Research Council &lt;a href="https://www.conicet.gov.ar/?lan=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;(CONICET&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-manicure-lamps"&gt;Studying manicure lamps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serrano’s team placed common skin molecules, including tyrosinase, inside a chamber that mimicked a salon lamp and zapped them for the same four‑minute cycle used in most gel services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All targets, from amino acids to lipids, emerged chemically altered and less able to perform their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These devices are used without any controls or regulations requiring manufacturers to report on the potential risks of frequent exposure,” cautioned Dántola and colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the starkest changes hit tyrosinase, the enzyme that drives production of melanin, a pigment that shields DNA from solar radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also measured how fast the altered molecules sparked &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; reactions that can shred cell membranes. Reaction rates jumped within seconds, confirming that harm starts long before a hand is removed from the booth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-photosensitization-matters"&gt;Why photosensitization matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photosensitization happens when a molecule absorbs light then transfers that energy to oxygen, creating reactive species. Those species slice through DNA, proteins, and lipids with no regard for cell repair cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because tyrosinase sits at the start of melanin synthesis, even small interruptions amplify downstream damage. Losing melanin’s natural sunscreen effect makes every future dose of sunlight or lamp light more hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many over‑the‑counter skincare ingredients, including retinoids and some antibiotics, can enhance photosensitization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who use them may face higher risks because their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vitamin-c-promotes-skin-renewal-and-anti-aging-at-the-genetic-level-dna-demethylation/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; already carries extra light‑reactive compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tyrosinase-melanin-and-lost-defense"&gt;Tyrosinase, melanin and lost defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyrosinase flips the chemical switches that turn the amino acid tyrosine into melanin granules. When the lamp’s photons broke those switches, the team saw melanin output stall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without melanin the skin compensates poorly for incoming ultraviolet, so photo‑aging and cancer risk rise. The altered enzyme also disrupts color balance, explaining reports of blotchy pigmentation after frequent gel sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-manicure-lamps-are-very-bright"&gt;Manicure lamps are very bright&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bench measurements showed the lamp delivered a dose of &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/what-s-the-difference-between-uva-and-uvb-rays-.h15-1592991.html"&gt;UVA radiation&lt;/a&gt; around 368–400 nanometers, the same band blamed for tanning and wrinkles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A separate American &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35876-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 reported that a 20‑minute session killed up to 70 percent of cultured human skin cells and stamped permanent mutations on the survivors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensor data from the Argentine team indicate the lamp’s irradiance peaks at 7 milliwatts per square centimeter, nearly matching the noon sun in Buenos Aires during spring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weekly visits translate into roughly three and a half hours under that intensity each year, more than many people spend sunbathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38557455/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 concluded that while the absolute cancer risk appears low, the evidence remains weak and long‑term users should be told the data gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-short-bursts-long-shadows"&gt;Short bursts, long shadows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gel clients often repeat the service every two to three weeks, layering dose upon dose across years. Cumulative exposure matters because photochemical injuries add rather than heal, especially when they trigger oxidative stress and DNA breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49814-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;test&lt;/a&gt; on human keratinocytes showed sunscreen with SPF 50 cut cell death by more than one‑third during the same four‑minute irradiation used in salons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protective gloves that leave only the nail plate visible can block over 90 percent of the rays, yet they remain optional accessories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are processes that, in one way or another, result in cell death,” added Dántola and colleagues after monitoring the altered enzyme profiles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comment echoes warnings from dermatology societies that link chronic UVA to premature aging and certain skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-keeping-nails-and-skin-safe"&gt;Keeping nails and skin safe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dermatologists at the &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/gel-manicures-dermatologists-share-tips-to-keep-nails-healthy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Academy of Dermatology&lt;/a&gt; urge customers to apply a broad‑spectrum SPF 30 or higher on their hands before every gel manicure and to choose LED lamps that cure polish faster and with lower UV output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salons can switch to newer hybrid lacquers that air‑dry or set under visible blue light, trimming exposure further. At home, limiting sessions and spacing them at least a month apart reduces cumulative dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For clients unwilling to give up the chip‑free finish, simple habits help: wear fingertip‑less UPF gloves, time the lamp cycles carefully, and keep moisturizer handy because dry &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teen-skin-bacteria-could-hold-the-secret-to-acne-prevention/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; amplifies light penetration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators have yet to issue binding standards for consumer nail lamps, so the burden falls on users and technicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serrano’s group believes clear warning labels and pre‑packed barrier gloves would let people enjoy the beauty trend while understanding the trade‑offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-manicure-lamps-speed-vs-safety"&gt;Manicure lamps: Speed vs. safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beauty business around gel nails is sizable. Analysts &lt;a href="https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/industry-analysis/uv-nail-gel-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; the global UV gel polish segment alone was worth almost six billion dollars in 2024 and could double within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media trends and influencer tutorials push fans to redo manicures every week rather than once a month, increasing exposure well beyond the study’s four‑minute baseline. Convenience encourages at‑home kits, yet those kits often ship without detailed safety instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dántola stresses that the project sits in basic science, aimed at mapping chemical events rather than legislating behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, sharing data allows dermatologists, engineers, and regulators to design larger trials that measure real &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-carry-toxic-chemicals-that-are-easily-absorbed-by-skin/"&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; after repeated consumer‑level doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied research may soon test glove fabrics, lamp filters, or polish formulas that polymerize under visible light.

Participants disclosed how they drank their java. Regular or decaf? With sugar and milk or without? If with, how much? They then compared that information to National Death Index data to deduce how coffee consumption could have impacted mortality from all causes, including cancer and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After examining the data, researchers found that drinking one to three cups of coffee per day was linked to a reduced risk of death from all causes, “especially when the coffee is black or has minimal added sugar and saturated fat,” explains &lt;a href="https://drperlmutter.com/about/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://drperlmutter.com/about/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="David Perlmutter, M.D." data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;David Perlmutter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and fellow of the American College of Nutrition. Specifically, they found that drinking black coffee or coffee with less than 2.5 grams (or a little more than a half-teaspoon) of sugar and less than a gram of saturated fat from milk or cream per 8-ounce cup was associated with a 14% lower risk of dying from any cause compared to not drinking coffee at all, Dr. Perlmutter adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The catch here is, the study also found that most Americans add around 3.2 grams of sugar and a half-gram of saturated fat to each mug, which means the majority of coffee drinkers are less likely to get its life-extending benefits. “This is the problem with so many coffee specialty drinks that seem to be so popular,” Dr. Perlmutter says. &lt;br data-node-id="9.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-coffee" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Benefits of coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;There is plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2025/when-it-comes-health-benefits-coffee-timing-may-count" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2025/when-it-comes-health-benefits-coffee-timing-may-count" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="existing research" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;existing research&lt;/a&gt; that purports coffee’s health boost. Without added sugar or fat, it’s a naturally good source of antioxidants like polyphenols and chlorogenic acid, explains Dr. Purlmutter. “These components and others help fight inflammation and oxidative stress,” he adds, both of which are contributors to chronic disease. That’s how coffee may help &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a62414579/caffeinated-coffee-and-tea-reduce-heart-disease-risk-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a62414579/caffeinated-coffee-and-tea-reduce-heart-disease-risk-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reduce risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease" data-node-id="11.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;reduce risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, and congnitive decline, “all of which influence lifespan,” he concludes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="side-effects-of-coffee" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Side effects of coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Coffee’s caffeine content can even exhibit perks by improving alertness, metabolism, and brain health, Dr. Pelrmutter says. However, there is such a thing as overdoing it and reaping negative side-effects such as anxiety, increased blood pressure, heart palpitations, digestive issues, and insomnia, says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., R.D" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., R.D&lt;/a&gt;., a cardiology dietitian at Entirely Nourished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;She adds that a “very high coffee intake may also slightly reduce calcium absorption, potentially affecting bone health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-drink-coffee-for-good-health" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;How to drink coffee for good health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The study supports drinking one to three cups of black or minimally altered coffee per day. Dr. Perlmutter recommends keeping sugars below 2.5 grams and saturated fats below 1 gram per cup by using low-fat milk or plant-based creamer alternatives. Routhenstein adds that if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or have otherwise been prescribed a specific caffeine intake, follow your doctor’s recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Lastly, to avoid over-caffeination, Dr. Perlmutter suggests enforcing a “coffee curfew” that marks the time of day after which you turn off the pot. “I generally recommend 2 p.m. to minimize coffee’s impact on sleep,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:35:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9MS0I4djU0OFlENXc5OUM4bGtGZmJCZkVPSjdDUWZ5N0xvTnZZMFZ5OXV4aHUwYkd0QXdlUk1tam12ZDBELXlJOGd5aFY0SEhMdGo2YURKVWV4TGNuOHFyRnNESGItTWVkUUNGYWJkdmlITWU3dXNsaE9xM3JRdw</guid></item><item><title>房客专栏|我们24岁的房客患有精神疾病。如果不启用他，我们怎么能提供帮助？ -《华盛顿邮报》 | Guest column | Our 24-year-old has a mental illness.

He was a very gifted student and got into an elite university but dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year after developing delusions that people were trying to poison him. He was hospitalized and later diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He has lived with us on and off since then and is a very different person from the son we once knew. He is often disrespectful and, over the years, sometimes stopped talking to us for a year or more at a time. Those periods were torturous — especially for me as his mother — because we had no way of knowing if he was dead or alive. He’s been back in touch recently, but it seems mostly to get our financial help to pay his rent and utilities. My husband worries we’re enabling him by continuing to help and feels like he’ll never grow up if we keep providing financial support. I worry that if we stop helping, he’ll cut off contact again or end up homeless.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJL2ECPY4RCUNAGJ7QOOT72RNQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Parents with adult children with mental illness suffer a unique and painful set of torments: the possible loss of contact with a child they love, fears about what the future holds for them, and the sorrow of witnessing a life that may never fulfill the promise it once seemed to carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5YBNI4HH6ZB6FKCHE2ZNHK4ZCI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your husband’s desire to draw the line with financial support is entirely understandable. It’s incredibly difficult to continue to offer help to someone who isn’t contributing to their own well-being and is also treating you with disrespect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PMFPTTAO6NH3XAH2XTMDTLUWIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yet the prescription for tough love assumes emotional and cognitive resources that your son, given his diagnosis, may not have access to. It can be easy for family, friends, even therapists to say, “Just cut him off” — imagining that will somehow jump-start maturity. But that advice often ignores the simple but painful truth that when someone is living with profound mental illness, there may not be a straightforward solution — only different trade-offs and adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WDIDT4ZEOJBMVLKFLTNXCWNZHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What if withdrawing support leads not to resilience but to another psychotic break, homelessness or suicide? These are outcomes that no parent easily recovers from — and ones that often haunt families for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="HFRAVZHRNZAMJNOID2QOII4RQ4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="HFRAVZHRNZAMJNOID2QOII4RQ4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Love and limits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJH4EIZFSNDQDFFNZ3LHPFP35Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many parents in your position fall into the trap of blaming themselves. They comb through their history, wondering what they could have done differently. But while no parent gets everything right, schizophrenia is a biologically based illness with strong genetic roots. It is extraordinarily unlikely that anything you did — or didn’t do — caused this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWBVIUOSRBEJRBC5E7YXBPJQEA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That doesn’t mean you have to support him unconditionally. One possibility is to tie your financial support to constructive behaviors: for example, continuing support only if he meets weekly or biweekly with a therapist and checks in with a psychiatrist to monitor his medications. If he’s too disabled to work, perhaps your support can be contingent on his volunteering or participating in some structured, meaningful activity during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TCM7UHUGLFFUJCUFEFDNGGGBNE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because your son can sometimes be disrespectful, it’s important to practice love and limits. Love, because the challenges he faces are real and not of his choosing. Limits, because mental illness — especially when unmanaged — can sometimes lead to manipulation, aggression or rewriting of the past: “If you hadn’t done that, I’d be fine. It’s all your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ROHTYIV6HVCP3P3EUF4IW3MHSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you decide to continue helping him, do so without resentment. And if you choose to decline a request, do so without guilt-tripping or moralizing. This approach — clear, consistent and emotionally neutral — is often more effective over time than trying to persuade or plead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="BXI5IAWN2ZHNLMUKMLBJWRI4QM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="BXI5IAWN2ZHNLMUKMLBJWRI4QM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Get support from others&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWA4KBRL7NCCDJFVQXDOJWZ5KU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s also critical that you and your husband not try to shoulder this responsibility alone. Having a child with severe mental illness can be incredibly isolating. Many parents have found the free “family-to-family” eight-week course offered through the &lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/" target="_blank"&gt;National Alliance on Mental Illness&lt;/a&gt; (NAMI) invaluable in getting support and information. Marital conflict is common in families navigating this terrain, but connecting with others in similar situations can reduce the loneliness, provide practical advice and give you a clearer sense of what may or may not be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XTLHBHXCVZEHFKJ3MYBO7EU4RE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Though schizophrenia is a chronic and often debilitating condition, some people do achieve stability — sometimes for long periods — when they receive consistent support, treatment and structure. The legal scholar Elyn Saks, for instance, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in early adulthood and went on to become a tenured law professor at the University of Southern California and a MacArthur fellow. In her memoir, “The Center Cannot Hold: My Journey Through Madness,” Saks reminds us that some people are able to build meaningful — even extraordinary — lives despite a severe diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XMGQACXY3BA7LFCNGLOQUTOOUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Still, not every story ends that way. Many individuals with schizophrenia continue to struggle despite love, structure and care. Your son’s path may not reflect the future you once imagined, but it may still include moments of connection, stability and dignity. And while your contact with him may sometimes feel one-sided, it may also be the only tether he has — and the only protection against something far worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HCVHKBCGQRAGRA7LSM6TOX2X4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You and your husband may never feel fully resolved in your choices, because there may not be a “right” one. But choosing to act with integrity, intention and love — in whatever form that takes — is its own form of wisdom.

But if you have the option, find a physician at an institution with expertise in your illness with whom you can imagine having the difficult conversations that accompany life-and-death decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IKF6CI667ZDIJNSCBLLYH6T2XA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In my case, that’s Karim Boudadi, the medical oncologist who anchors my team at Johns Hopkins/Sibley Memorial Hospital. We’ve been working together since early 2023, after the biopsy of a tiny lump in my upper left chest returned the unexpected diagnosis of Ewing’s sarcoma. In that time, we’ve developed a relationship of engagement, trust and candor that’s at the heart of my treatment and makes me an active participant in the process rather than just a care recipient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="JQWUWVPJSRBTNLPAKPDN7Z4DDU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="JQWUWVPJSRBTNLPAKPDN7Z4DDU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Get an advance directive&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EI2JJSBIIVB7HALQIPYB7PV7JM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Next, if you don’t have an advance directive yet, claim your superpower now.

This liberates my doctors to share the truth with me, and we can evaluate the existing options for treatment against my personal aspirations for how to live and die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="3PGINFMJKFALPJXAU4OGVOG2WQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="3PGINFMJKFALPJXAU4OGVOG2WQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Keep informed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HZZC4ID5MJA6TE6DVRVNETEIBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In addition, patients need to take responsibility (as best we are able) for our side of the conversation. Given how rapidly cancer treatment is evolving, I try to read up on recent studies. It  helps me ask better questions and gives me a sense of available treatments and their success rates. I’ve also learned to never be embarrassed to ask questions, in person or through the electronic message portal. I’ve decided it’s better to feel a bit dopey than uninformed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7B4ZGBHJ6ZHEJCL2MNUOD2RRWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And to make sure I’m accurately hearing what the docs are telling me, I take a sibling or a friend to appointments with me — either in person or via Zoom — to catch things I might have missed, and then help me to think through my choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ZLOMSNLBBBHDPDZVW67TPO7TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Giving me my best shot at living well for as long as possible requires a surprising number of doctors, nurses, technicians and support staff. In addition to Boudadi, so far, I have had a breast surgeon and a thoracic surgeon. And, since the metastasis to my lungs and a few bones last fall, I also have a radiation oncologist. When the system has a hiccup, nurse navigator Nadege Stevens steps in to save the day. Every time I get one of those surveys from the hospital to rate my care, I sing her praises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="DQ3T3BV5HFF6JBC3AM6RPORB7E" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="DQ3T3BV5HFF6JBC3AM6RPORB7E" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Tough conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AOFGT5S3PJCK7NIIZAB72RDKGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Every three months or so, I get a new PET scan to see whether and how my cancer has progressed, and then I meet with Boudadi. Together, we figure out next steps — including additional tests — to keep me alive and in relatively decent shape for at least another few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DGBCOQ5SP5BTNG7VGMSPXYQVDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At this point, we’ve already shared a lot. In the beginning, Boudadi oversaw my chemotherapy treatment through a six-month odyssey of hospital stays and hairlessness. Good news: My hair quickly grew back. Bad news: So did the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FOCQMPDCIRAWHJL4GCWXC744ZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When the sarcoma returned and nibbled into my pectoral muscle, Boudadi recommended a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/15/breast-surgery-prostheses-cancer-sarcoma/" target="_blank"&gt;modified radical mastectomy&lt;/a&gt;. I was shaken. But Boudadi gave it to me straight: “Letting this cancer grow will not only shorten your life but make your remaining days more painful. Even if you don’t live longer because of this operation, your quality of life, however long it is, will be better for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QQYSGEDNIBEFJN3FHYLF4Q3SIQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Last fall, when the mastectomy also failed to contain the cancer, we moved into trickier territory. There is no single second-line treatment — no one standard follow-up protocol beyond what we’ve already tried&lt;b&gt; — &lt;/b&gt;for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8071040/" target="_blank"&gt;metastasized Ewing’s&lt;/a&gt;, just a variety of chemo cocktails, which have not been shown to significantly increase life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6NUN3XFE6RASZB6ARC5F4Z34BA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many people opt to take every last chance to live a while longer; but I was reluctant to trade my overall decent health for the likelihood of being made very sick for the rest of my days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PSXPLNFSJFHY3NHBTUBWI4NP5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I asked Boudadi whether I was properly interpreting the data and if it would be a mistake to reject further chemo, he acknowledged that I had accurately assessed the available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IFZYABGX45EDHJ3ZNS6ZXRXQ4Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I know how you value quality of life,” he told me. “Perhaps if you were 15 we might push a little harder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IQKGD437FBFE3GIBHKPPDZW5KE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It was difficult to hear, but it was also what I needed to know.

&lt;p&gt;For years, &lt;strong&gt;eggs&lt;/strong&gt; were considered a controversial food in the health community. Once blamed for raising &lt;strong&gt;cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; levels, they were largely excluded from &lt;strong&gt;“clean” &lt;/strong&gt;diets, with many health experts recommending their reduction or elimination. However, recent scientific findings have turned this narrative on its head. The humble egg, often relegated to the sidelines of &lt;strong&gt;nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; debates, is now being recognized for its potential benefits, particularly when it comes to &lt;strong&gt;bone health&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Research Reveals Unexpected &lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal&lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/fo/d3fo04248k/unauth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Food &amp;amp; Function&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has brought new insight into the relationship between &lt;strong&gt;egg consumption&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;overall health&lt;/strong&gt;. The research followed nearly &lt;strong&gt;19,000 adults &lt;/strong&gt;and found that those who consumed approximately &lt;strong&gt;1.5 eggs per da&lt;/strong&gt;y displayed significantly stronger bones compared to those who avoided eggs entirely. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, participants who ate eggs regularly showed a &lt;strong&gt;72% higher bone density&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/oops-these-human-fossils-fooled-scientists-for-decades-the-truth-is-wild/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86049" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;femur &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and an &lt;strong&gt;83% &lt;/strong&gt;higher bone density at the&lt;strong&gt; spine&lt;/strong&gt;. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the risks of eating eggs and highlight their role in promoting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/10/rich-in-vitamin-d-this-autumn-food-is-excellent-for-immunity-and-bone-health/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="12091" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in adults at risk of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/florida-mans-hands-filled-with-cholesterol-after-eating-6-9-pounds-of-cheese-and-butter-for-months/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="78967" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings suggest that eggs may contribute more to one’s health than just providing high-quality &lt;strong&gt;protein&lt;/strong&gt;. The bone-supporting properties of eggs are a key factor, with the research demonstrating that regular consumption of this food could be beneficial to &lt;strong&gt;skeletal integrity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Nutritional Components That Support &lt;strong&gt;Bone Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eggs offer an impressive array of &lt;strong&gt;nutrients&lt;/strong&gt; that are particularly beneficial for bone health. Each egg contains key &lt;strong&gt;minerals&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;calcium&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;magnesium&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;strong&gt; phosphorus&lt;/strong&gt;, all of which are essential for building and maintaining strong bones. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, eggs are a good source of &lt;strong&gt;zinc&lt;/strong&gt;, which is known to aid in bone repair and support immune function. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/10/rich-in-vitamin-d-this-autumn-food-is-excellent-for-immunity-and-bone-health/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="12091" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which helps improve calcium absorption, is also present in eggs, making them a valuable food for bone maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Perhaps less well-known, but equally important, is &lt;strong&gt;vitamin K1&lt;/strong&gt;, which plays a crucial role in activating &lt;strong&gt;osteoclasis&lt;/strong&gt;, a protein that is vital for bone strength. The presence of&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/this-cheese-is-great-for-your-health-it-can-even-cleanse-the-liver/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="73694" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; high-quality protein &lt;/a&gt;further complements these benefits, contributing to both bone and muscle maintenance. The combination of these nutrients in eggs provides a full spectrum of support for bone health, helping to explain the positive findings from the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Reassessing the &lt;strong&gt;Cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; Debate&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, the cholesterol content of eggs has been the subject of considerable concern. Many believed that the cholesterol found in egg yolks would contribute to elevated blood cholesterol levels, a significant risk factor for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/silent-killers-in-your-home-these-everyday-plastics-linked-to-millions-of-deaths/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75020" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. However, modern research has shown that the relationship between dietary cholesterol and blood cholesterol is not as straightforward as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Corinne Chicheportiche-Ayache, a noted &lt;strong&gt;nutrition expert&lt;/strong&gt;, explains that eating up to two eggs per day does not significantly raise cholesterol levels in healthy individuals. In fact, the cholesterol in eggs appears to have little effect on the body’s cholesterol levels, particularly when consumed as part of a balanced diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The egg yolk, often avoided due to its cholesterol content, contains &lt;strong&gt;antioxidants&lt;/strong&gt; and healthy fats, which are beneficial to the body. This new understanding is encouraging for those looking to include eggs in their daily diets without the fear of raising their cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Practical Tips for Including &lt;strong&gt;Eggs&lt;/strong&gt; in Your Diet&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eggs are an incredibly &lt;strong&gt;versatile food&lt;/strong&gt;, easily incorporated into a wide range of meals. Whether scrambled, poached, hard-boiled, or baked into a frittata, they can be enjoyed in numerous ways to suit various culinary preferences. They also pair well with fiber-rich foods such as &lt;strong&gt;vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;, legumes, and whole grains, which can enhance their health benefits. By adding eggs to your routine, you can enjoy a &lt;strong&gt;balanced diet&lt;/strong&gt; that supports both bone health and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nutritionists recommend that most individuals can safely consume one to two eggs per day as part of a healthy eating plan. This amount fits comfortably within daily nutritional guidelines and offers a host of health benefits without negatively affecting cholesterol. Whether as a quick breakfast or a satisfying snack, eggs are a simple and nutrient-dense food that can support your long-term health goals.&lt;/p&gt;

Still, the EPA has resisted calls for a ban, and Roundup formulas with the ingredient hit the shelves last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="33a4f7a2-eba1-49d7-a496-91d3ac9bbedc" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘We thought we’d got the numbers wrong’: how a pristine lake came to have the highest levels of ‘forever chemicals’ on record","elementId":"33a4f7a2-eba1-49d7-a496-91d3ac9bbedc","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/03/holloman-lake-birds-wildlife-pfas-forever-chemicals-aoe"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“From a human health perspective, this stuff is quite a bit nastier than glyphosate so we’re seeing a regrettable substitution, and the ineffective regulatory structure is allowing it,” said Nathan Donley, science director with the Center For Biological Diversity, which advocates for stricter pesticide regulations but was not involved in the new research. “Regrettable substitution” is a scientific term used to describe the replacement of a toxic substance in a consumer product with an ingredient that is also toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diquat is also thought to be a neurotoxin, carcinogen and linked to Parkinson’s disease. An October &lt;a href="https://foe.org/resources/new-roundup-new-risks/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of EPA data by the Friends of the Earth non-profit found it is about 200 times more toxic than glyphosate in terms of chronic exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bayer, which makes Roundup, faced nearly 175,000 lawsuits alleging that the product’s users were harmed by the product. Bayer, which bought Monsanto in 2018, reformulated Roundup after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a possible carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The new review of scientific literature in part focuses on the multiple ways in which diquat damages organs and gut bacteria, including by reducing the level of proteins that are key pieces of the gut lining. The weakening can allow toxins and pathogens to move from the stomach into the bloodstream, and trigger inflammation in the intestines and throughout the body. Meanwhile, diquat can inhibit the production of beneficial bacteria that maintain the gut lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Damage to the lining also inhibits the absorption of nutrients and energy metabolism, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research further scrutinizes how the substance harms the kidneys, lungs and liver. Diquat “causes irreversible structural and functional damage to the kidneys” because it can destroy kidney cells’ membranes and interfere with cell signals. The effects on the liver are similar, and the ingredient causes the production of proteins that inflame the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Meanwhile, it seems to attack the lungs by triggering inflammation that damages the organ’s tissue. More broadly, the inflammation caused by diquat may cause multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, a scenario in which organ systems begin to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors note that many of the studies are on rodents and more research on low, long-term exposure is needed. Bayer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Despite the risks amid a rise in diquat’s use, the EPA is not reviewing the chemical, and even non-profits that push for tighter pesticide regulations have largely focused their attention elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Donley said that was in part because US pesticide regulations are so weak that advocates are &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/11/epa-reapprove-paraquat-herbicide-parkinsons" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tied up with battles&lt;/a&gt; over ingredients like glyphosate, paraquat and chlorpyrifos – substances that are banned elsewhere but still widely used here. Diquat is “overshadowed” by those ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Other countries have banned diquat, but in the US we’re still fighting the fights that Europe won 20 years ago,” Donley said. “It hasn’t gotten to the radar of most groups and that really says a lot about the sad and sorry state of pesticides in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some advocates have &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/06/30/epa-pesticides-exposure-opp/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accused the EPA&lt;/a&gt; of being captured by industry, and Donley said US pesticide laws were so weak that it was difficult for the agency to ban ingredients, even if the will exists. For example, the agency banned chlorpyrifos in 2022, but a court overturned the decision after industry sued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moreover, the EPA’s pesticides office seems to have a philosophy that states that toxic pesticides are a “necessary evil”, Donley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“When you approach an issue from that lens there’s only so much you will do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 12:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOTDNnb3NaRUFqQ3o4eTFENGpnUzBTMzBDVW1jNUtzeHFfRVBQUGptQVltNDV2cXJPLTEyNHpfVU1Sa0FFUDNRMVVxT2pFRVRCZnh0SVBLaTM1M2QyX2xDMU1pVHN0MkxybWhmaHdLUVVfNnhrUmpacmp2ZnB1Q0VKUWJWeURMTzNDb0x3clptOG5xZw</guid></item><item><title>关于疫苗成分硫柳汞的4个须知事项- NPR | 4 things to know about the vaccine ingredient thimerosal - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNVFVNVWlNSmIxbVVZSGk0bmYyTHZGdDBlWDBTbGRDRU9qZ3dUSUJUNHBjN1d3QlhqOU5oT0RDdzh1VzNZeWdoLVI5V2VBSTFjNkxCcjI3Q2xLYUlaOXJ4RXVjQndjbzh0ZERiXzVONFlvYXZva2pQakZNVklsYVBwOGtVUGdqTFB4T0tJQjZxYjkyRkZVY0lMREJxV2UteGlVWUdlOTlyNE9OWnlyQnpj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Though most flu vaccines don't include the preservative thimerosal, advisers to the CDC have recommended against using it.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The federal government could soon recommend that people only receive flu shots made without an ingredient called thimerosal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The preservative has been absent from the majority of flu vaccines for nearly two decades, but was on the agenda of a committee that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on vaccine policy. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The June meeting &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;was the first since&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the month, when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sacked all 17 previous members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and installed his own slate of seven.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thimerosal has been a target of groups that question vaccine safety. That's despite "a long record of safe and effective use" as a vaccine preservative, according to the Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In three separate votes, ACIP recommended that children, pregnant women and all adults receive single-dose flu immunizations with vaccines that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;don't contain thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;. The next step would be a decision by Kennedy or the CDC on the recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's sort of like they turned this meeting into solving a problem that doesn't really exist anymore," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, a former chief scientist at FDA who is now at Georgetown University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lone committee member to vote against the recommendations was &lt;a href="https://geiselmed.dartmouth.edu/faculty/facultydb/view.php/?uid=8272" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Cody Meissner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Of all the issues that ACIP needs to focus on, this is not a big issue," he said. "The risk from influenza is so much greater than the non-existent, as far as we know, risk from thimerosal."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added: "There is no scientific evidence that thimerosal has caused a problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But what is thimerosal and what would happen if it is effectively banned from flu shots? Here are four things to know.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;It's a preservative that contains mercury&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thimerosal is a chemical compound that's about 50% mercury by weight, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/thimerosal-and-vaccines#pres" target="_blank"&gt;according to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;, and has been used in trace amounts as a preservative in vaccines and medicines since the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The compound is used in vials containing multiple doses of the flu vaccine. Its job is to keep the vial from getting contaminated between patients and potentially getting someone sick, says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/staff-member/dr-michelle-fiscus/" target="_blank"&gt;Michelle Fiscus&lt;/a&gt;, chief clinical officer of the &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Association of Immunization Managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're constantly going in and out of the vial to draw up a new dose, you run the risk of getting bacteria or fungus into that vial," says Fiscus. "And we don't want those vaccines to be contaminated."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She says although most flu vaccines come in single-dose prefilled syringes today, the multi-use vials are cheaper and take up less space in refrigerators. So for some health centers, they're more practical.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When we're coming into flu season, it's not uncommon to get all of your flu vaccine upfront at the beginning of the season. And sometimes storage in the refrigerator can be an issue," Fiscus says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, they're not common. According &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/prevent/vaxsupply.htm" target="_blank"&gt;to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 94% of flu shots in the 2024-25 season were thimerosal-free or thimerosal-reduced.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Thimerosal has been used infrequently since 2001&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1997, the FDA Modernization Act required the government to evaluate mercury in childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the heavy metal comes in different forms. Methylmercury is the compound found in seafood that doesn't break down easily and can be toxic. Ethylmercury, the form in thimerosal, has a different risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It didn't distinguish between that kind of mercury and ethylmercury, which is a form of mercury that's very quickly managed by the body and eliminated through the kidneys," says Fiscus. "And ethylmercury is where thimerosal is derived."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thimerosal was removed from most childhood vaccines in 2001, even though there was no evidence showing it caused harm to vaccine recipients, Fiscus says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;It has a discredited link to autism &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Concerns that vaccines cause autism originated with a now-retracted 1998 study by Dr. Andrew Wakefield, which focused on the MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella. Wakefield lost his medical license and &lt;em&gt;The BMJ,&lt;/em&gt; a prominent medical journal, called it an "elaborate fraud" in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452" target="_blank"&gt;a 2011 editorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite that, speculation about a link between vaccines and autism — once &lt;a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/01/rfk-jr-cites-flawed-paper-claiming-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-in-hhs-confirmation-hearing/" target="_blank"&gt;championed by Kennedy himself&lt;/a&gt; — continued and expanded to include thimerosal, even though a link to autism has been repeatedly disproven.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/05/mmr-vaccine-and-thimerosal-containing-vaccines-are-not-associated-with-autism-iom-report-says" target="_blank"&gt;2004 report&lt;/a&gt; published by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine reiterated that thimerosal wasn't associated with autism. Subsequent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/about/thimerosal.html" target="_blank"&gt;studies in 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010&lt;/a&gt; showed thimerosal was not associated with autism or neurophysiological problems, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;What's more, Georgetown's Goodman points out that despite thimerosal's removal from most vaccines, autism rates have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5445270/autism-rates-have-soared-this-doctor-says-he-knows-part-of-the-reason-why" target="_blank"&gt;continued to rise over the last 20 years&lt;/a&gt;, "which certainly would not be consistent with having anything to do with childhood vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ol class="edTag"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Most people won't notice if thimerosal is no longer recommended in shots&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since most flu shots are administered with single-dose syringes, most people probably won't notice this fall and winter if the CDC decides to effectively ban thimerosal, Fiscus says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, a thimerosal ban could present some challenges because health centers begin ordering flu vaccines in February for the next flu season. It's possible manufacturers will have to swap them out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sanofi, which makes multidose vials of a vaccine called Fluzone as well as single-dose syringes, says only a "very small number" of its doses contain thimerosal. "We acknowledge the recommendation of the new ACIP. We now await the decision by the CDC on the path forward. We will have sufficient supply of Sanofi flu vaccine to support customer preference for this season."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Seqirus, the other company that makes multidose vials of flu vaccine containing thimerosal, said in a statement to NPR that they "represent a very small proportion" of its total vaccine supply. "We are committed to supporting our customers in fully transitioning to single-dose syringes and do not expect any impacts to our supply or shipment timing this season."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The committee's process could be a sign of things to come&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fiscus, from the Association of Immunization Managers, says the committee's decision to only recommend single-dose flu shots without thimerosal shows that it is willing to make a decision without following protocol and considering the scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Is this now going to be the standard?" she says. "That's very concerning if that's where this is heading."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goodman also worries that these moves will ultimately undermine confidence in vaccines in the United States and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"One of my real concerns is that although the flu vaccines aren't perfect, they save lives. When they're given, they're still underutilized," he says. "If there's more difficulty in accessing them or affording them, at the end of the day, people would get hurt."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute researchers, along with colleagues in the UK and U.S., have linked brighter night-time light exposure to elevated risks of five major cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Circadian rhythms govern fluctuations in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+rate/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, platelet activation, hormone secretion, and glucose metabolism. Long-term disruption of those rhythms in animal and human studies have produced myocardial fibrosis, hypertension, inflammation, and impaired autonomic balance. Previous research efforts relied largely on satellite-derived estimates or small cohorts using bedroom or wrist light sensors, leaving personal exposure patterns uncharted at population scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Personal night &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/light+exposure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;light exposure&lt;/a&gt; predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases in &amp;gt;88,000 individuals," &lt;a href="http://medrxiv.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/2025.06.20.25329961" target="_blank"&gt;posted on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;medRxiv&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a prospective cohort analysis to assess whether day and night light exposure predicts incidence of cardiovascular diseases and whether relationships vary with genetic susceptibility, sex, and age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data came from 88,905 UK Biobank participants, average age 62.4 ± 7.8 years and 56.9% female, who wore wrist-based light sensors for one week between 2013 and 2016 across England, Scotland, and Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazard modeling linked night and day light exposure percentiles with new diagnoses of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+failure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, atrial fibrillation, and stroke recorded in National Health Service files through November 2022. Models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, photoperiod, socioeconomic variables, lifestyle factors, sleep metrics, clinical risk factors, and polygenic scores.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Brighter nights showed dose-response associations with higher risk across all five outcomes. Participants classified in the 90–100th percentile of night-time light exposure experienced 23–32% higher hazard for coronary artery disease, 42–47% for myocardial infarction, 45–56% for heart failure, 28–32% for atrial fibrillation, and 28–30% for stroke compared with those in the 0-50th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relationships persisted after controlling for physical activity, smoking, alcohol, diet, sleep duration, socioeconomic status, and genetic risk. Women displayed stronger associations for heart failure and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coronary+artery+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coronary artery disease&lt;/a&gt; whereas younger participants showed stronger associations for heart failure and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/atrial+fibrillation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors propose circadian misalignment induced by unnatural light may trigger metabolic and vascular perturbations that elevate cardiovascular risk. Impaired glucose tolerance and heightened diabetes susceptibility may foster endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-driven hypercoagulability could increase thromboembolic events, while sustained elevation of 24-hour blood pressure may damage vascular endothelium and provoke myocardial hypertrophy. Conflicting timing signals to sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes may amplify arrhythmic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bright+light/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bright light&lt;/a&gt; during habitual sleep times may serve as a practical addition to established cardiovascular prevention strategies, according to the authors, who call for circadian-informed lighting guidance in homes, hospitals, and urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors knew when the outbreak had started — June 17, 1894 — but they didn’t know what had broken out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of the many cases erupting in Rutland County that summer varied so much that they made doctors unsure of the diagnosis. A three-year-old boy, labeled Case 1, was a previously healthy, active child who developed a moderate fever and appeared to have indigestion. After three days, his fever broke, but he could no longer walk. After 10 days, he started to move about by holding onto chairs. Then, after three weeks, he regained full use of his legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another child, a six-year-old boy, Case 64, had also been in good health when he developed a high fever, accompanied by vomiting. On the sixth day, he suffered paralysis in his right arm; the next day he could no longer move his left leg. Ten weeks later, he was no better — both extremities were still paralyzed and the muscles were weakening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he was more fortunate than a six-year-old boy, Case 4, who suddenly began convulsing while playing in the street. The convulsions lasted hours. He also exhibited a moderate fever, rapid pulse and vomiting. The muscles in the boy’s neck and back became rigid and his arms and legs became extremely sensitive to the touch. On the sixth day, he died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alarming news surely spread more quickly than the disease itself. Newspapers carried brief reports about Vermonters who doctors believed had contracted meningitis. While the papers also covered a number of active epidemics, including smallpox, typhoid and measles, it wasn’t until late August that they connected the dots and reported that these suspected meningitis cases also represented an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 27, the Rutland Daily Herald reported that doctors believed an epidemic of cerebral meningitis, spinal meningitis and cerebro-spinal meningitis had hit the city and surrounding area. Over the past five weeks, the paper wrote, the outbreak had “been rapidly gaining headway until it has attained serious proportions.” &lt;/p&gt;

Photo via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatal cases or ones leading to total paralysis were relatively rare, doctors told the newspaper. However, they noted that many of the infected patients suffered paralysis in at least one limb and “the recovery of the patients (was) doubtful and slow.” Most cases seemed to be spinal meningitis “or a disease closely resembling it,” the Herald stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same article where it reported that the probable cause was meningitis, the Herald relayed a conflicting theory: “From information gained from physicians in the city yesterday it has been learned that polio-myelitis anterior [commonly known as polio]…seems to be the disease of the epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second diagnosis ultimately proved correct. Although it was buried in an article that was itself buried on Page 4 of the newspaper, the news was earth shattering: Vermont was suffering the first polio epidemic ever in the United States. In fact, this was the largest outbreak yet recorded anywhere. Although few people at the time had heard of polio, the disease would soon become a global terror. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;News that it was polio that had broken out in Vermont came from Charles Caverly, a 37-year-old Rutland doctor. Caverly, who was educated at Brandon High School, Kimbell Union Academy and Dartmouth College before attending medical school at the University of Vermont, had recently become president of the Vermont State Board of Health. As such, Vermont doctors were required to send Caverly detailed reports of any cases they encountered of this perplexing and disturbing disease. Those descriptions enabled Caverly to diagnose the disease correctly as polio, rather than a form of meningitis, making him the first person to identify a polio epidemic. He communicated his findings to the American medical community&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Early in the summer just passed,” he wrote in the November issue of the Yale Medical Journal, “physicians in certain parts of Rutland County, Vermont, noticed that an acute nervous disease, which was almost invariably attended with some paralysis, was epidemic.” &lt;/p&gt;

Photo via the Silver Special Collections Library, University of Vermont&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking the disease, Caverly wondered if geography might hold clues as to the source. The first cases were observed in the city of Rutland and the town of Wallingford. While most cases continued to arise in Rutland, they soon also emerged in other area towns. All but six of the reported cases occurred in the Otter Creek Valley, an area measuring roughly 30 miles long and 15 wide. The creek, contaminated with sewage and running at a particularly low level that summer, was a possible source. But Caverly believed he could rule it out. Most people who contracted the disease got their water from wells or mountain streams and springs. Similarly, “general sanitary conditions did not seem to have any influence on the epidemic,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caverly considered whether animals were the source of the disease. He wrote that that summer, domesticated animals, including horses, dogs and fowl, had been dying of an “acute nervous disease, paralytic in its nature.” It was an intriguing idea. Subsequent research, however, has shown that polio only affects humans.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Polio didn’t appear to be contagious, Caverly wrote. He had received only one report where more than one family member had contracted the disease. But appearances were deceiving. It turns out that most people infected with polio are asymptomatic. (In later years, after studying more cases, Caverly came to accept that polio was contagious.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caverly and his fellow doctors faced a massive obstacle in understanding polio. At the time of Vermont’s epidemic, virology was in its infancy. The poliovirus wouldn’t be isolated for another 15 years. Researchers eventually determined that the virus is typically transmitted through contact with an infected person’s feces or through droplets from their sneezes or coughs.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Caverly failed to determine the cause of the outbreak, he provided helpful demographic information that showed the disease, which is sometimes called infantile paralysis, doesn’t only afflict the very young. In fact, he found that 15 cases were reported in people over age 14, including one case involving a 70-year-old. His statistics also showed that males were more prone to the disease; females only represented one-third of the Vermont cases. Research has since shown that both sexes are equally susceptible to contracting polio, but males are at higher risk of suffering paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the 1894 epidemic, Vermont experienced a respite, with few cases emerging. Then in the summer of 1910, the state recorded 72 cases. Caverly, who remained in his role as president of the Vermont State Board of Health, was again on the case. A leading authority on polio, Caverly investigated a large outbreak in Vermont in 1916, which saw 64 cases. That year, more than 27,000 cases were reported in the United States, including 2,000 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1918, Caverly faced a new challenge: charting an epidemic of another frightening disease, a deadly influenza strain. Doctors had little recourse against the outbreak. No vaccine existed. They counseled bedrest and isolation, when possible, to limit its spread. That year, the new influenza killed an estimated 675,000 Americans. Among them was Charles Caverly, who died in October at the age of 62.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He only lived long enough to see the start of the enormous damage polio would inflict, and he didn’t get to witness the medical miracle that all but eradicated the disease. Each summer, parents braced for the arrival of polio season, when the disease always hit some part of the United States and spread overseas. Adults were also susceptible, including future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who contracted polio in 1921 at the age of 39.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear of polio was part of everyday life. Public officials closed beaches, swimming pools and amusement parks in an effort to stop the spread. Parents warned their children not to drink from water fountains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors found that roughly one out of 200 polio infections led to irreversible paralysis and roughly 5 to 10 percent of those cases proved fatal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the late 1920s, an artificial ventilator called an iron lung was invented, offering hope to patients who could not breath on their own because their chest muscles were paralyzed. The iron lung became the image many people associated with polio. Patients were slid into these cumbersome, sarcophagus-like machines with only their heads sticking out. Some polio patients required weeks or months inside an iron lung to recover use of their own lungs; others remained in an iron lung for life. The machines soon populated hospital polio wards — as well as the nightmares of parents and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real hope of not just treating polio, but defeating it, arrived in the mid-1950s. Dr. Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine had started work on a polio vaccine in 1948. By 1953, he was so confident of its safety and effectiveness that he vaccinated himself, his wife and their three sons. Two years later, on April 12, 1955, the American public learned that Salk’s vaccine had proved successful in clinical trials and would immediately be distributed. Across the country, communities celebrated the news by ringing church bells. Newspapers carried triumphant headlines. The Pittsburgh Press declared simply, “Polio Is Conquered.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polio epidemic peaked in the United States in 1952, with nearly 58,000 recorded cases. By 1957, the number of cases had dropped 95 percent to 5,485. By 1964, the number had fallen to 106 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, thanks to Salk’s vaccine, which has been further refined, polio is largely a disease of the past. A global survey in 1988 found that there were still roughly 350,000 cases in 125 countries that year. Massive vaccination initiatives have lowered that figure to 62 known cases in two countries in 2024, or less than half the number of cases identified in the Otter Creek Valley in 1894.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is what Democracy looks like:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[750 words] &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We elected a better Democrat, and then we spoke up for her. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backstory: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those who don't know or forgot, and at the urging of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/comments/2330729/91564298#comment_91564298" target="_blank"&gt;quite a few of my favorite Gnusies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I regale you with the following.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Briefly, I supported the progressive candidate for county sheriff &lt;/strong&gt;here in Washtenaw County, the home of the Michigan Wolverines. (Read about her progressive programs &lt;a href="https://www.dyer2024.com/priorities" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alyshia was the underdog&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The two largest cities in the county are Ann arbor and Ypsilanti, and almost all the members of those 2 city councils endorsed her opponent. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;The county prosecutor, Eli Savit, endorsed her opponent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Alyshia’s opponent’s campaign raised $300,000, which is 50% more than she raised ($200,000). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dark-money interests funded 2 mailings for her chief opponent’s campaign, so he was able to send out 5 mailings, while Alyshia could only sent two.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I helped her campaign a little. In the last 10 days of the campaign, I created a new concept, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/story/2024/9/22/2271165/-Kosacks-You-have-a-new-Superpower-Grab-it-before-Election-Day-The-Diary-Deluge" target="_blank"&gt;Diary Deluge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;raised funds for her under my new rubric, “Late Money Is Like Lemonade,” which is a play on &lt;u&gt;EMILY&lt;/u&gt;'s list, “Early Money Is Like Yeast.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the course of those days, members of Daily Kos came to my county’s aid and donated $600 for her campaign. In the last week of the campaign, she and her campaign manager, Will Garcia, told me they loved watching funds drop into her ActBlue account from distant states. Again, thank you, Gnuville and Daily Kos! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Note that good campaigns &lt;u&gt;plan&lt;/u&gt; to run out of money by the last day. However, with the delivery of the $600 from Daily Kos, Alyshia and her campaign manager had extra money on Election Day, and with that, they pulled victory out of from underground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On the morning of election day, Alyshia’s campaign made about 40,000 robocalls. In the early afternoon, they got reports from volunteers about how they were faring at the precinct level, the two of them decided to launch about 3,500 text messages to a geographically microtargeted group of people in the specific precincts where she was doing poorly, based on their skills and the previous filtering they had done on her social media.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the dawn’s early light on Election Day, Alyshia was down 800 votes with about two thirds of all votes already cast. On election day itself, she gained 1,200 more votes than her chief opponent with only one third of the votes remaining! Alyshia won by 384 votes out of 61,534 votes cast or 0.6%!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After 100 days in office&lt;/strong&gt;, in May 2025, Alyshia sent out this newsletter: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://content.civicplus.com/api/assets/2bf324d8-f2b5-4733-8f51-ff9ec6389731" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our First 100 Days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This week. &lt;/strong&gt;On Wednesday morning, Will, her campaign manager, texted me that she needed help again: She needed people to speak before the county board in support of her programs that evening. When I said I would help, Will forwarded me a long list of possible talking points, and I had time before the meeting to craft my remarks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In all about 10 county residents spoke for Alicia's programs. Out of about 25 speakers, I was one of the last. I introduced my remarks by saying I stood in solidarity with some of the previous speakers, and I named them. And I added that since they had already mentioned certain topics, I would skip those. Then I began my remarks as planned. For the curious, you can read the text of my remarks before the board &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tOXXYAlTWLWQO_KeNnVgOb9XzLTyE4yuFRJ2qcGxVBI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As I spoke, I watched the countdown clock, and when I finished my prepared remarks with about 20 seconds left, I spoke from my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; heart and expressed my deep gratitude to the members of the board for their difficult work. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That was my political adventure this week. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s next? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, I plan to contact about 10 precinct delegates who have told me in the past that they wanted me to inform them when Alicia needs support at county board meetings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;This week, I plan to contact two other precinct-delegate leaders in my county.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;I might speak before the board again next month, if asked. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among [Alyshia’s] accomplishments was this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://content.civicplus.com/api/assets/2bf324d8-f2b5-4733-8f51-ff9ec6389731" target="_blank"&gt;Our First 100 Days&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We attended and coordinated dozens of community events and established 13 community-driven policy teams to co-create our practices with the people most impacted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13 community-driven policy teams, co-creating. If we could replicate and foster this concept, throughout cities, it would go a long way towards changing the landscape. Not just in policing. But in governing. And in campaigns! &lt;/strong&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/6/22/2329284/-GNR-Sunday-Good-News-Roundup-2-Polls-WWtW-When-will-you-protest-the-bombing-of-Iran?_=2025-06-22T04:31:35.000-07:00#comment_91500124" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;denig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.] &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Five R’s of the Resistance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve repeated these for many years. I’ve added boycott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resist:&lt;span&gt; Boycott, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;protest on the streets, call senators and representatives, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebel: &lt;/strong&gt;Run for office, GOTV (Get Out The Vote), support a progressive.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revolt: &lt;/strong&gt;Change the laws, change the culture, build your communities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rely:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Trust that millions of others are fighting the good fight.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Take care of yourself, we are in this for the long term.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;WineRev’s Good and Goofy Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Watch for WineRev’s History Corner in the comments: &lt;strong&gt;“Here there be highlights, lowlights, and sidelights from events of this date from years ago, so you might get a different and longer perspective on how humans have coped, as well as a few items that will help you win Bar Bets on Trivia Night at your favorite watering hole.” &lt;/strong&gt;You can find&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/user/WineRev/comments" target="_blank"&gt;all his comments here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, even today’s, once he posts it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; You can search for &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; in Roundups to quickly find his comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;WineRev from Wednesday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dancing Gnu of Sunday means……..not what it usually does. After several bleary-eyed takes on the wall calendar, it IS Wednesday, and yet the Gnu of Sunday is Dancing in your dreams and before your pixel-ed eyes. My first take was that 2thanks was SO EAGER to get to an Independence Day Weekend Sunday that he/him just lost control. But upon checking sources (like reading the opening 300 words) we find 2thanks and his/he/him’s Dancing Wonder Gnu are pinch-hitting for another of our Front Pagers (good luck in the interview, bilboteach!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now YOU, the arriving seekers and finders and depositors of Good News, now you know why the Gnuville Breakfast Brunch is set up OUTDOORs at the ball field…….because we have a pinch-hitter, which means this is a Wednesday baseball game by the dawn’s early light. (Heard that line sung just recently.) You’ve gotten in the gate here, but don’t miss the goodies. The Bev Bar is in full serving mode with mimosas, margaritas, wine spritzers and morgen bier (German “morning beer”) for all the wonderful fans…...oh, and there’s also coffee, tea and mocha-cocoa, but at a baseball game……&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Snack Stand of Steam Tables have a steady flow of Gnusies picking up fan fare from the griddle, grill, smoker, toaster and microwave (alas, to oven-baked tater-tot hot dish this morning…..since the Snack Stand doesn’t have an actual oven.) Now carry your day break drink and your dawn doggie bag of breakfast up to your seats. There are rockers, wingbacks and recliners everywhere in the stands, while there are sofas in the Chaise Boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now tune in and cheer the Good News here at Round Up field! There are stories to read, rec, click a link, reply to, ask about and digress from, along with chuckles and cheers of various sorts. We thank 2thanks for the Launch (and he’s out there with a pinch-hit double and standing grinning on 2nd base.) Thank YOU for coming here as well, bringing your thoughts and cheers and heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Science&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please share good science news with us!

&lt;p&gt;A good place to look for science news if you are waiting for the Sunday Roundup is the archive of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/history/blog/overnight%20news%20digest" target="_blank"&gt;Overnight News Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. On Saturdays, the OND always focuses on science, though not all of it is devoted to what I would call Good Science News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;… Say Something&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We welcome certain comments in&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Roundups every day regarding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National or local Good News.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

We all do what we can. Since 2017, &lt;/span&gt;we’ve shared positive news, laughed, organized, resisted, rebelled, revolted without being revolting, relied, rested, mentored, created, crossed rivers, chewed our cud, and laughed.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank You!:&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many regular Roundup readers know that I’m the co-founding Admin and background mentor of the Good News Roundup group.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Over the years I’ve supported and led this and other Daily Kos groups that have raised almost $1M for candidates, individuals, and groups. In response to my previous requests, many readers sent me gifts, $1500 so far toward my goal of $12,000.&lt;span&gt; Team 2thanks thanks you&lt;/span&gt;! 💙&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m now asking for help to pay&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;for my wife’s medical treatments. If you value my gifts and activism, please don’t patronize me, but be my patron.

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In a delicious turn of events, scientists succeeded in taking the optics of olive oil to create the first-ever microlaser made entirely from edible materials. If commercialized, they could offer an easy and safe way to monitor food or medications from inside your body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The technology, introduced earlier this month in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adom.202500497"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advanced Optical Materials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, exploits an interesting tendency for droplets of common cooking oils, which emit a photon of light when subjected to a certain amount of energy. Arrange multiple droplets in a room full of mirrors, and together they shine more brightly—like a concentrated beam of light. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The researchers tested more than a dozen different types of materials—sunflower oil, cooked butter, plain water, and more—to see which would generate the cleanest laser. And the winner was olive oil. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One prominent component of olive oil is chlorophyll, the molecule most commonly known to make plants green. In this case, the chlorophyll molecules, trapped in the sticky surface of olive oils, generated photons in a chain reaction of sorts, transforming the droplet of olive oil into a laser. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brightness of the chlorophyll changes in accordance with the size and density of the oil droplets, making the laser highly sensitive to environmental conditions, according to the study. For example, adding it to different dishes of food and observing changes in the  laser allowed the researchers to measure things such as sugar concentration or acidity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What’s more, the researchers were able to encode data within the droplets akin to the lines of a barcode, into a peach compote. Surprisingly, the data—the specific date of April 26, 2017, which happens to be the first international Stop Food Waste Date—remained intact for over a year, demonstrating the microlaser’s potential to safely carry information, such as the identity of a manufacturer or an expiration date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Since this is the first such study, there are many possibilities for developing various edible lasers and their applications, which could ultimately find their way to everyday use,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

She’s also deaf and blind, with some functional vision in one eye and hearing with an aid in one ear. Hope was born with an extremely rare mitochondrial condition called MLS syndrome, of which there were only &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7041/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;64 documented cases&lt;/a&gt; in the US as of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;MLS syndrome, for Hope, causes a potentially life-threatening heart condition called cardiomyopathy, which can make her heart pump blood less efficiently. In February 2024, she started sleeping about 17 hours a day, and her speech began regressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;An echocardiogram revealed that Hope’s heart function had dropped about 14 percentage points, into potentially hazardous territory. She then started taking elamipretide, an investigational drug for mitochondrial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Pretty soon, honestly, she had a lot more energy,” her mother, Caroline Filchak, said. Most importantly, her heart stabilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e01aec7a-275d-46b5-9f10-bdc646e3fde8" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Ben and Caroline Filchak with their son, Thomas, and Caroline’s sister, Anna Bower, at an FDA advisory committee meeting&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Caroline Filchak&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hope’s aunt, Anna Bower, said her niece’s “quality of life dramatically improved” and soon after, she was “running, dancing, and playing” like any other child her age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;First developed in 2004, elamipretide has a long history. Advocates for patients with Barth syndrome – another mitochondrial condition with about 150 known patients – asked Stealth BioTherapeutics to pick up the drug in 2014 and shepherd it through the regulatory process. Stealth submitted its first application to the FDA in 2019, and then it went through four different review divisions at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an October 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/guVE0UilHkY" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the FDA’s cardiovascular and renal drugs advisory committee, patients and physicians spoke about the positive effects of the drug, and the advisers eventually voted 10-6 to recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Patients and families saw the [advisory committee’s] endorsement as an encouraging sign because the FDA almost always follows its recommendation,” Bower said in June. “But last month, it didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA rejected the application in May. Internal FDA reviewers &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/182553/download" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the drug had not met its endpoint in phase 2 trials of 12 study participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We don’t feel like they looked at a totality of evidence where the patient’s voice was heard in the decision,” Caroline Filchak said, who added that it’s been difficult to measure the effectiveness of the drug because of how rare the disease is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The FDA did offer a new pathway to approval, Stealth said in a &lt;a href="https://stealthbt.com/stealth-biotherapeutics-announces-path-forward-despite-disappointing-delay-for-ultra-rare-barth-syndrome/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. That process takes at least eight months, though it can also take years. Stealth laid off 30% of its staff after the rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Advocates such as Filchak are worried the company will not be able to continue pursuing approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If [the FDA] drag their feet like they have throughout this entire process, Stealth is not going to be able to continue operations,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Under the new pathway, the medication is not available for infants. Stealth has &lt;a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/health/colorado-parents-fda-drug-infant-barth-syndrome/73-89f43375-ddfa-4669-90a2-324a01b8f894" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that 35 patients around the world are receiving the medication, and two-thirds of them are very sick infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a congressional hearing in late June, the Republican representative Earl L “Buddy” Carter of Georgia asked Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of the US Department of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; and Human Services, about treatments for rare mitochondrial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Carter mentioned two young constituents with these conditions, including Hope Filchak. The children “need your help in accessing life-saving medications”, Carter said, promising to follow up with Kennedy after the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For now, Hope has a three-month supply of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For children like Hope, there are no other options,” Bower said. There are no FDA-approved medications like elamipretide, and there are no similar drugs in late-stage development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Caroline Filchak said that this administration “does have a stated commitment to accelerating therapies for rare diseases. And it seems like this recent decision by the FDA doesn’t align with that commitment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="994d4e4e-530a-4d65-85cd-842e7073d8ff" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;FDA commissioner Marty Makary speaks during a news conference in Washington DC on 22 April.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: José Luis Magaña/AP&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Marty Makary, the FDA’s commissioner, recently announced plans to accelerate approval for select drugs and companies. He has also &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2835314" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;floated&lt;/a&gt; the use of machine learning, often called AI, to review applications quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But there are already &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;four ways&lt;/a&gt; for the FDA to expedite the review of new medications, and the approval speed is not the sticking point for drugs such as these, Filchak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Elamipretide is an example of the difficulty of developing drugs for ultra-rare conditions – and for approving them based on clinical evidence, said Holly Fernandez Lynch, bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s not the poster child of FDA efficiency,” Fernandez Lynch said, noting the long time span and the four different review divisions at FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But it’s also not the poster child of ‘Oh my God, we have a drug that works amazingly well, and FDA is standing in the way, and why won’t they just use their regulatory flexibility?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The drug hasn’t been approved yet because it hasn’t met a pre-specified endpoint, Fernandez Lynch added: “If the evidence doesn’t support approval, if the systematic evidence collection doesn’t show benefit, then FDA really can’t approve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The biotech company is now resubmitting data on knee strength improvement as part of its new application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Of course, these patients have a need. Of course, they have an altered tolerance for risk and altered tolerance for uncertainty,” said Fernandez Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“That’s the really devastating part of all of this. And it’s really heartbreaking, but it does not mean the FDA should grant approval to a product that hasn’t been demonstrated effective, because we really don’t know that it works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Approving a medication without this evidence could lead to issues developing other drugs for the same conditions, Fernandez Lynch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“People say, ‘Well, what’s the big deal? These patients have nothing. Just let them try it.’ I get that. If I was that mom, I would do the same thing, right? But the FDA has to make judgments for the population,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For Caroline Filchak, who works for a petroleum delivery company, she plans to continue advocating for her daughter and other affected children – and has even gotten the whole family involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“You don’t, when you think about having a kid, think that you’re going to be doing this, but you do what you’ve got to do for your kids,” she said, noting that she and her husband, Ben, took their seven-year-old son, Thomas, to the October meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We call him our baby advocate. Ever since that meeting, every night when he would say his prayers, he would pray that the FDA says ‘yes’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jul 2025 11:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxQckFzWDFsSW00UDVYWFpDZE10elc0TUtMQzhKMlNLZXctcnhJREpDVUJNa244WkhoVG1sSHdaYm1IcVNWcEdKTGpocENtQlZiY3RMZGVTal9MYmpuWU5OTlNGQWN1ZmJjY3JqQnlXZXFwdE9CLWJ0c0lwZW9jcHF0S0hVaw</guid></item><item><title>我们很多人都忘记了接种疫苗之前的生活有多糟糕。我有一个理论。-石板 | Lots of Us Forget How Bad Life Was Before Vaccines.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnumxcw007pusm9pcrku2ze@published"&gt;Polio? What polio? Uncle Lloyd doesn’t remember his sister Pat having polio. As for him, he’s walked with a cane all his life, and did he have polio? No one in his family says so. He took up sailing as a sport at Princeton—so what. He winks. See, here are the family pictures, he says. Everyone straight as string.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blh001u3b77zalhk1bh@published"&gt;Pat’s résumé doesn’t suggest a polio survivor. One of the first women hired by CBS Radio, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/hitler-and-my-mother-in-law/22232925?ean=9781682196519&amp;amp;next=t&amp;amp;"&gt;Pat Lochridge&lt;/a&gt; was the only female journalist to cover both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters of World War II. She interviewed Hermann Göring twice, climbed to Hitler’s redoubt at Eagle’s Nest in snow up to her waist, was the first woman reporter to participate in a landing—at Iwo Jima—and &lt;a href="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2022/08/mayor-of-berchtesgaden.html"&gt;was appointed mayor&lt;/a&gt; of postwar Berchtesgaden.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blh001v3b774ogktwgz@published"&gt;Looking at the family photos, I see three girls in laced-up shoes, wearing knee-high white socks, no one on crutches. But later I find a photo of Pat, my mother-in-law, as a 9- or 10-year-old standing at the front of a line of girls, her half-paralyzed face much in evidence. She, like her brother, a very successful Austin lawyer, must have contracted a mild form of the disease. I telephoned the next generation of Lloyds, and Pat’s nephew said no one talked about his father’s limp, and all he ever heard about his aunt was her conquests.&lt;/p&gt;

Later, I find a newspaper clipping about Pat’s stint as mayor of Berchtesgaden, about how “frail” Pat was—“a victim of polio when she was a child, for years she was unable to walk.”&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;A 1943 interview in the San Francisco Chronicle with the same reporter is titled “Handicaps, Threats Didn’t Stop Her: Patricia Lochridge Is a Correspondent.” This piece observes that 27-year-old Pat suffered “infantile paralysis in her childhood” and achieved a top spot in her profession despite the tenet that “no reporter is better than his legs.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="9" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bli001x3b7711s865z0@published"&gt;It’s her family that won’t affirm her having polio.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="164" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bli001y3b777evaqmzb@published"&gt;Sixty years earlier, during Texas’ pioneer days, any sign of weakness meant that the family and its wagon had to be left behind. Pat, a descendant of those pioneers, could have inherited the instinct to show no pain or impairment—or was it a more basic drive of preservation? Dogs are set upon by other dogs if they whimper. In the 1950s, the last time polio was a scourge in the U.S., families considered contracting the disease shameful. In order to catch it, you must have associated with the wrong people or gone “slumming.” The irony is that polio actually becomes dangerous when sanitation is good. People living in poorer neighborhoods develop antibodies, since you can gain immunity by ingesting the virus in small doses. But if you caught the disease and became disabled, wealthy or not, you were considered damaged and treated with less respect. Disabled family members &lt;a href="https://www.fdrlibrary.org/polio"&gt;were often put into asylums&lt;/a&gt; back then and left there for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bli001z3b779jxjlj5c@published"&gt;Pat shrewdly used the diagnosis to her advantage. In her 1995 interview for Nancy Sorel’s &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1559704934/?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Women Who Wrote the War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, she says “that the fact that she had come down with polio when young had cemented her friendship” with FDR. Pat’s “great personal friend,” as she refers to FDR, also worked hard to obscure his disability. He devised a method of “walking,” using a cane and the arm of his son or adviser for balance, and maneuvered his hips and swung his legs forward in a swaying motion. Overcompensating, he would sometimes make seven speeches a day on the campaign trail but requested that the press never photograph him walking, maneuvering, or being transferred from his car. The press took great pains to obey him. At the now-demolished Philadelphia Municipal Stadium in 1936, after he was nominated for a second term, his braces slipped as he was moved behind the speaker’s platform. He fell into the mud, and pages of his speech scattered. While his aides collected the papers and helped him to stand, Pat’s CBS colleague Robert Trout, who was providing on-the-spot radio reporting, said not a word.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="221" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blk00203b77mutbp089@published"&gt;Politically, FDR couldn’t be seen with a disability—only two of the 35,000 photographs in the Roosevelt Presidential Library at Hyde Park show him in a wheelchair—but it’s not as if nobody knew about it. How he coped became a powerful symbol of an individual’s persistence in managing with an impairment.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;He was, in part, defined by how he dealt with his disability, admired and remembered for it. “Every time I hear your voice on the radio and read about your attitude toward physical handicaps … I am strengthened and my courage is renewed,” wrote &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1627797467/?tag=slatmaga-20"&gt;one of his constituents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Roosevelt bought Georgia’s Warm Springs resort to relieve his symptoms and occasionally led therapy sessions himself, &lt;a href="https://greensboro.com/remembering-fdrs-holiday-ritual/article_708973d2-6e57-5a67-8e22-de1ea1a8b7ab.html"&gt;where patients called him&lt;/a&gt; “Uncle Rosey.” To support the polio clinic, he organized Birthday Balls all across the country, using his date of birth as an occasion to raise money to combat the disease, the first time philanthropy was open to everyone. Radio commentator Walter Winchell provided the catchy slogan: “Dance so that a child might walk.” Six thousand balls were held in 1934, and Roosevelt &lt;a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=9Cgg_vy7564C"&gt;raised over $1 million&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $20 million in today’s money, laying the groundwork for the March of Dimes, its mailbags soon full of the dimes that poured into the foundation’s office to help fund the vaccine. Eventually, FDR’s face appeared on the dime itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Her stepmother had insisted she wear special leg braces and shoes as a child and forced her to do physical therapy to strengthen her legs. This regimen did not endear her stepmother to Alice, and although Alice was able to walk without braces as an adult, perhaps their discord was why all mention of her polio was buried. Alice also apparently connected the humiliations of disability with social class, stating that she felt “like a tenement child … deformed with my legs.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bll00223b77b2mpbci2@published"&gt;Ten years after FDR’s death, his foundation helped launch the nationwide inoculation program that ended the polio epidemic. Early supporter Winchell almost stopped the program. He warned that Jonas Salk’s cure “may be a killer,” suggesting on TV, on the radio, and in the newspaper that the vaccine contained live virus. He could have been extra cautious with regard to the lives of children, but his words mirrored those of the anti-vaccine movement, popularized by the Daughters of the American Revolution, the American Legion, and other right-wing organizations, that persists today, having gained new steam during COVID-19 and now being cemented into the federal government by the second Trump administration. Only in this one instance &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/18/elvis-presley-polio-vaccine-confidence-448131"&gt;was Winchell right&lt;/a&gt;. A single batch was indeed &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/02/cutter-incident-polio-vaccine-drive-history.html"&gt;not properly inactivated&lt;/a&gt;, and 79 children contracted polio— out of 1.8 million.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bll00233b778szvhqrk@published"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new secretary of Health and Human Services, was born in 1954, the year before the polio vaccine was government-approved. One of his uncles, President John Kennedy, signed the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a9.htm"&gt;Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962&lt;/a&gt; into law, expanding the use of the few childhood vaccines available at the time. “There is no longer any reason why American children should suffer from polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, or tetanus,” Kennedy told Congress. RFK Jr. spread much misinformation about vaccines prior to his appointment, and a lawyer who helped him build a list of federal officials to nominate for the department &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/13/health/aaron-siri-rfk-jr-vaccines.html"&gt;once petitioned&lt;/a&gt; the Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the polio vaccine. RFK Jr. has no medical training—which means that, unlike doctors, he’s never sworn to do no harm.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blm00243b77ib8drf50@published"&gt;Though the efficacy of the polio vaccine has been known for over 70 years, new HHS policy around testing may (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/"&gt;it’s not clear yet&lt;/a&gt;) require the older vaccine, or new variations on it that are now being developed, to be tested using placebo trials. This is an outcome that’s still far from coming to pass, but just imagine if it did happen. There would be children assigned to the placebo group exposed to the virus; 1 in 200 in a given group of infected children would be affected to the point of irreversible paralysis, and 5 to 10 percent of that smaller subset would die. Yes, some victims do recover from mild infections well enough to sing and perform, to take up the practice of law, to report during wartime, but some do actually die. Since 80 percent of those who contract polio are children under the age of 5, those in the trial won’t have any say about their participation, signed up by parents who most likely have been vaccinated themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="140" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bln00253b7727sej897@published"&gt;Out of the nearly 2 million children who received the vaccine in 1955, &lt;a href="https://sph.umich.edu/polio/#:~:text=In%20observed%20areas%20there%20were,where%20polio%20was%20already%20prevalent"&gt;only one died&lt;/a&gt;. Every corner of the U.S. had victims before the vaccine. Even my tiny grade school of 100 children in 1950s Nebraska had two polio victims, one of them known as “Skippy” for his gait with braces, and both dragged themselves around while the rest of us screamed and chased each other on the playground. Persuading teenagers, those near immortals, to get vaccinated was the biggest challenge. To sway them, Elvis Presley &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-who-have-had-polio-2022-8#polio-was-once-one-of-the-most-feared-diseases-in-the-us-1"&gt;was given his shot live&lt;/a&gt; on Ed Sullivan’s TV program. Parents of the boomer generation rushed to get the oral vaccine for themselves and their children. The boomers, having schoolmates or friends with the disease, vaccinated their own children. Few of the next generation have seen the disease for themselves or felt its threat.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bln00263b77d8zaq6ye@published"&gt;But imagine that your child is one of those who contracts polio during these new trials, if they do happen. They will also be susceptible to post-polio syndrome, which affects &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-polio-syndrome/#:~:text=Who's%20affected,to%20as%20high%20as%2080%25"&gt;15 to 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; of older adults who, years after the initial bout, have to suffer the disease all over again. Joni Mitchell, who didn’t have a choice whether to take the vaccine because it didn’t exist when she was exposed, contracted polio at age 9. &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/celebrities-who-have-had-polio-2022-8"&gt;She writes&lt;/a&gt;: “If [polio] eats the muscles of the heart, it kills you; if it eats the muscles that control the flexing of your lungs, you end up in an iron lung; if it eats the muscle of your leg, it withers.” She began to sing and write songs while in the hospital for polio in her spine. Mitchell has had post-polio syndrome for the past 30 years. That’s a long time to suffer for a decision somebody else made for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="147" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5bln00273b77fft7dr11@published"&gt;These days, celebrities who’ve had polio don’t hide their ordeal. Like Mitchell, Mia Farrow has long been involved in polio campaigns around the world, having &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/celebrities-who-have-had-polio-2022-8#polio-was-once-one-of-the-most-feared-diseases-in-the-us-1"&gt;endured being in an iron lung&lt;/a&gt; for eight months and had all her belongings burned. Director Francis Ford Coppola was stricken at the age of 9: “There were gurneys piled up three and four high in the hallways because there were so many more kids than there were beds in the hospital. … I remember the kids in the iron lungs who you could see their faces on mirrors, and they were all crying for their parents. They didn’t understand why they were suddenly in these steel cabinets.” Violinist Itzhak Perlman has always worn leg braces and crutches that &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2022/09/16/itzhak-perlman-polio-vaccine-music-violin-1736948.html"&gt;force him to perform seated&lt;/a&gt;. “I never wanted people to say, ‘Well, you know, for somebody who can’t walk, he plays very well.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="150" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blo00283b773hrmyb4q@published"&gt;There is yet another hidden affliction that polio survivors suffer, which is emotional. In an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2020/05/04/my-mothers-childhood-bout-with-polio-paralyzed-more-than-her-body-ive-spent-much-my-life-trying-understand-that-paralysis/"&gt;essay in the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson writes about her polio-stricken mother who, as a child, spent a year in the hospital with the disease. She recovered so well she danced the ballet and became a poster child for the March of Dimes. Her mother told a reporter that she was determined “to live her life so that no one would notice she’d ever been sick,” perfectly reflecting Pat’s practice. “But she never really fully recovered,” writes her daughter, as “polio paralyzed more than her body.” Dickinson believed that the early experience of isolation and abandonment—her parents were allowed to visit only on Sundays—severely affected her psyche. Her mother rarely hugged her, or held hands, or kissed her, a state of affairs that my husband remembers only too well with regard to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="154" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcnv5blo00293b77g5lg25nu@published"&gt;Like FDR, Pat excelled in the outside world, and perhaps, like him, as a result of her disability. She prioritized strength over truth and fabricated her wellness. Her parents wanted to put her and her brother’s strengths ahead of their disabilities, until they could decide for themselves what to tell people. The irony was that she was driven to report the truth of what she saw as a reporter, but her family felt obliged to cover up the truth of her body. Never did she talk about having polio in the 19 years I knew her as my mother-in-law.
