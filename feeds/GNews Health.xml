This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Data shows that heart attack cases are on the rise in young people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahsan Ayaz, study author and an internal medicine resident at Montefiore St Luke's Cornwall Hospital in New York, said: 'Based on our findings, the two-year period after a colorectal cancer diagnosis is a critical period when patients need aggressive care to improve cardiovascular outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For example, there should be an aggressive approach to control cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities like &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-32d09790-05a1-11f0-83a7-eff5085fe898"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and hypertension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is also a need for coordination between oncology teams and primary care teams, because most of those risk factors are managed by primary care providers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since the 1990s, early-onset colon cancer has increased by 50 percent, and rates are expected to double between 2010 and 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, which will be presented later this month at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session, looked at data from 630,000 patients in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While some warning signs are easy to spot — such as severe chest pain — others are more vague and hard to pinpoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All patients were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 2000 and 2021. The patients' exact ages are unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular mortality was defined as deaths from heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, tears or aneurysms in the aorta, or atherosclerosis - a buildup of plaque in the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found colorectal cancer patients overall had a 16 percent increased risk of dying from cardiovascular causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear what demographic they used as a control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their likelihood of dying from these conditions was highest in the first two years after their colorectal cancer diagnosis, increasing to 45 percent during this period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer patients under age 50 were 2.4 times more likely to die of cardiovascular issues than people in the same age group who did not have cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, researchers concluded that Black colorectal cancer patients had a 74 percent increased chance of dying from cardiovascular issues, and white men were at a 55 percent increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ayaz suggested the racial disparities could be due to socioeconomic issues, location, and access to care, but added that more research on this is needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said the increased risk among colon cancer patients could stem from heart damage linked to cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation, called cardiotoxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee, pictured at left, died of colon cancer earlier this year at age 26. Monica Ackermann of Australia, pictured at right, was just 31 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These treatments may lead to inflammation, scarring, and other forms of heart damage that makes it more difficult for the heart to function properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer also results in widespread inflammation that can spread to the heart, making it more prone to damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the risk of cardiovascular death may be greater in younger people because they need more aggressive treatment, which could increase their chance of cardiotoxicity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate study published earlier this year looking at 25,000 adults with colorectal cancer in Denmark found patients under 50 were &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14215241/doctors-reveal-tragic-young-people-colon-cancer.html"&gt;more likely to be diagnosed at later stages&lt;/a&gt;, meaning their cancer was more prone to spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Later-stage cancer often requires more aggressive combinations of surgery, chemo, radiation, and immunotherapy, all of which can contribute to cardiotoxicity.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ayaz said: 'For therapies that are newer, there is not a lot of data on the side effects and toxicities, but evidence is emerging that they cause cardiovascular toxicity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team is planning to conduct additional research on cardiovascular mortality in colon cancer patients receiving different types of treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 01:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Find Strong Link Between Drinking Sugary Soda and Getting Cancer -

The five-year survival rate for OCC, which &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28865100/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;causes painful sores&lt;/a&gt; on either the lips or the gums and can spread down the throat if left untreated, is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9437560/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;only 64.3 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new paper published in the journal &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaoto.2024.5252?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamaoto.2024.5252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;JAMA Otolaryngology-Head &amp;amp; Neck Surgery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, the University of Washington researchers looked at long-term healthcare data for more than 162,000 healthcare workers from the &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/long-running-nurses-health-study-at-risk-of-shutting-down/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Nurses' Health Study&lt;/a&gt; and identified 124 cases of OCC among them. Crunching the numbers, the researchers found that people who drink at least one sugary soda beverage per day were at a 4.87 times greater risk of developing OCC than their counterparts who had less than one such drink per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who don't smoke or drink — or do so lightly — the numbers were even more stark: those who consumed one or more sugary soda per day were 5.46 more likely to develop OCC than people who drink less than one per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper only establishes correlation, not causation, but the results are pretty striking. Brittany Barber, an assistant professor of otolaryngology head and neck surgery who led the research with her colleagues at UW, told &lt;em&gt;UPI&lt;/em&gt; that rising rates of this type of cancer among women are "alarming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, sugary soft drinks have not been studied as one of the culprits behind that rate rise among nonsmokers — especially after rates of OCC related to smoking have seen a steady decline thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343649/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;successful anti-smoking campaigns&lt;/a&gt; and legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the report notes, there were 355,000 new cases of OCC and 177,000 deaths globally. Despite being far "less common than breast or colon cancer," as Barber notes, that's still a pretty grim ratio of deaths to diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than implying that the sugar from sodas themselves is causing people to get OCC, the researchers hypothesize that "diets with higher added sugar may contribute to chronic inflammation." Previous studies have connected &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41405-024-00265-w" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;excessive consumption of sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt; with gum disease — which, in turn, has been &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/2018/01/more-evidence-of-link-between-severe-gum-disease-and-cancer-risk" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;linked to oral cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will obviously need to be more research to pin down this apparent connection — but in the meantime, cutting out full-sugar sodas, or soft drinks completely, may be your best bet for avoiding mouth cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on oral health:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/rfk-fluoride-water-tooth-rot" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;When They Took Fluoride Out of the Water Like RFK Jr. Wants to Do Everywhere, People's Teeth Started Rotting Out of Their Heads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 00:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE5scllyM2xOcnl0Tlg0dF9wTXdHUzIwUUIxZEtEN0ppbmJVSzZKR2ptcEgtMG50RXBkTThPQUI5NGV1cHRtSVE4TDd3MmFqaF9MVjlFRl9CWi1pNElMcHVMSF9Taw</guid></item><item><title>Kennedy Instructs Anti-Vaccine Group to Remove Fake C.D.C.

Kennedy Jr., the nation’s health secretary, on Saturday instructed leaders of the nonprofit he founded to take down a web page that mimicked the design of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s site but laid out a case that vaccines cause autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The page had been published on a site apparently registered to the nonprofit, the anti-vaccine group Children’s Health Defense. Mr. Kennedy’s action came after The New York Times inquired about the page and after news of it ricocheted across social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The page was taken offline Saturday evening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has instructed the Office of the General Counsel to send a formal demand to Children’s Health Defense requesting the removal of their website,” the Health and Human Services Department said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“At H.H.S. we are dedicated to restoring our agencies to their tradition of upholding gold-standard, evidence-based science,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It was not clear why the anti-vaccine group might have published a page mimicking the C.D.C.’s.

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The chances of developing the cancers rose in men too, with new-onset type 2 diabetes linked to a 74% increase in pancreatic cancer and a near quadrupling in the risk of liver cancer in the five years afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A smaller effect was seen for bowel cancer, with the risk of the disease 34% higher in women and 27% higher in men with new-onset type 2 diabetes compared with people without a recent diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Diabetes and obesity are associated with similar cancer types,” said Owen Tipping, a medical student who worked on the study with Andrew Renehan, professor of cancer studies and surgery at the University of Manchester. “Our research was detecting the effect of diabetes on cancer, after adjusting for obesity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Previous studies have linked &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/03/cancer-obesity-weight-us-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;obesity with 13 types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, many of which are also more common in people with type 2 diabetes. But researchers have struggled to work out whether diabetes itself raises the risk of some or all of the cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;For the latest study, the Manchester group turned to the UK Biobank which holds medical and lifestyle data on half a million people. They examined the records of 23,750 people with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and compared them with more than 70,000 matched controls without diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;There tends to be a surge in cancer diagnoses shortly after people are found to have diabetes, simply because patients have more medical tests. The researchers accounted for this spike in cancer due to better detection by ignoring cases reported within a year of a diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the study, after five years the risk of any obesity-related cancer was 48% higher for men recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes than for those without the condition. For women, the risk was 24% higher in those with a recent diabetes diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Not all obesity-related cancers rose with diabetes, however. Women with diabetes were no more likely to develop endometrial cancer or post-menopausal breast cancer than those without, according to the study which will be presented at the European Congress on &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/obesity" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Obesity&lt;/a&gt; in Málaga, Spain, in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Across the population, the lifetime risks for liver and pancreatic cancer are higher for men than women. In the UK, one in 76 men and one in 130 women will develop liver cancer, while one in 55 men and one in 59 women will get pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Tipping said it was too early to know whether people with diabetes would benefit from cancer screening, but added: “We know with pancreatic cancer that it’s important to detect it early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It is unclear how diabetes might drive cancer, but scientists suspect high levels of insulin, high blood glucose and chronic inflammation. The sex differences may be driven by hormone levels, how sensitive the body is to the effects of insulin or variations in body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sophia Lowes at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK said: “This study helps increase our understanding of the link between diabetes and cancer. While many questions remain about how and why diabetes might cause cancer, research like this is vital in helping us better prevent, detect and diagnose the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Overweight and obesity cause at least 13 different types of cancer. The world around us doesn’t always make it easy, but keeping a healthy weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet is one way to reduce the risk of cancer. There are other steps people can take too, such as not smoking and cutting down on alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 23:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNbExfcVVkMW5SNXE2YXZqeWFPdnUwdUdHUWJFeEJrVXhJX2E1eTNrTWtUWFJydWE0QnBDN01iekRmU1JFTk45XzFyT0FqTHY0YkJRM0FvVXR2VjlTb3VHOVVOM25OUGZDbjdMSmFSVHhjOEdIYzJqaktQeFlVYlhLMWkxUE80d3M1N0tFM2dBaGxBcVlzUkxBT2FmN2treVNTemhlZEdHX0J2ZDRHRFV2Y2YzVC1QQ3lCenh5VjRyNA</guid></item><item><title>Prostate cancer risk increases by 45% among men who share one troubling behavior - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE8tTFFmYzIwMlBTVjJscmFnT0sxLWVOYm16ZEpBd1dPZlNUMjl5VmJqc1l2N0tJdmlKT1Q5VUdCQjVzVFlKOENoSEpyd3N2YTlxVmNreS1NM216QlB6cmgxeHQ3bE1KblBaRzJLUUNPZ3ZYREJUSEdj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are warning that men who regularly dodge prostate cancer screening appointments are 45% more likely to die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer/prostate-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostate cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; is the most common cancer among men and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths, according to UC San Francisco (UCSF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if screening programs are introduced on a national scale — particularly those that measure levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood — they could give men earlier access to treatment, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/prostate-cancer-cases-spike-us-state-doctors-share-likely-reason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Prostate Cancer Cases Spike In This Us State As Doctors Share Likely Reason;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prostate Cancer Cases Spike In This Us State As Doctors Share Likely Reason&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They would thus have a better chance of being cured, according to reporting by news agency SWNS and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening can also prevent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:costly treatments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;costly treatments&lt;/a&gt; associated with advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A new study examined the link between the consistent decline of men's screenings and the risk of dying from prostate cancer.

and preventative care in general."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, "This is the opposite behavior of people who are perhaps more health-conscious and are more likely to attend a screening appointment … Our study identifies that men who were invited for screening, but do not attend screening appointments, are at a significantly higher risk of dying from prostate cancer compared to men who were not offered screening or accepted an invitation for screening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Long-term data from this entity consistently shows that PSA screening programs can lead to a 20% reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Leenen said that experts "need to better understand who these men are, why they choose not to attend appointments and how to motivate them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing so, she added, "will help us design population-based prostate cancer screening programs that encourage higher rates of informed participation … Tackling attendance rates in this way could be a big factor in the long-term success of a national prostate screening program," SWNS reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urologist Tobias Nordström, M.D., Ph.D., of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said, "We need to better understand why these men might actively choose not to participate in screening, despite being invited to attend, and how this behavior is linked to worse outcomes when they get a diagnosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from the study are scheduled to be presented this weekend at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Congress in Madrid, Spain, said SWNS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News' senior medical analyst &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/s/marc-siegel" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Marc Siegel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Marc Siegel&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the new study on prostate cancer risks, previously called out the need for regular medical screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Siegel has emphasized the need to "diagnose it early for better outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Angelica Stabile of Fox News Digital contributed reporting. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt;

or people who have had past surgical complications to avoid an elective operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Dr Charles Lee, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, has revealed why certain people shouldn't get plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the people Dr Lee says should avoid cosmetic procedures and why. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;People with body dysmorphia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly two percent of Americans have been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder as of 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental health condition that causes you to excessively and obsessively criticize perceived defects or flaws in your appearance that are usually minor or non-existent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person's fixation is far beyond the typical dissatisfaction people may have - like wanting to lose 5lbs - and can cause a person to constantly feel embarrassed, ashamed and anxious to the point they avoid social situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Charles Lee, a board certified plastic surgeon explained why certain people should not get plastic surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two percent of Americans have been diagnosed with BDD as of 2024, according to National Alliance of Eating Disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, people suffering from body dysmorphia may seek out plastic surgery as a solution to fix their imperfections, but in one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drlee90210/video/7130480675517517098?lang=en"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lee advises them not to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert explained: 'So someone who looks at a perfectly normal part of their body but they see a big problem, you're not going to get that fixed with surgery that really needs to be taken care of.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of plastic surgery, doctors suggest seeking out mental health professionals who can help evaluate the situation and suggest appropriate treatment such as therapy and medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Control freaks and perfectionists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee added that people who are extremely particular in life and cannot bear slight asymmetries should not undergo procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perfectionists and control freaks tend to have a strong drive for flawlessness, which can lead to unrealistic expectations about the outcome of plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, there is always a risk of complications or flaws when it comes to cosmetic procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of a rhinoplasty (nose job) and eyelid surgery, it is normal to expect a bit of unevenness. However this may cause extreme disappointment among perfectionists - causing them to book more appointments and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lee added that people who are extremely particular in life and cannot bear slight asymmetries should not undergo procedures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee explained: 'Surgery is not that precise, and if you can't accept a few millimeters off here and there, you should not get plastic surgery, especially the more precise procedures, such as rhinoplasty or eyelid surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A fraction of a millimeter can be seen, but a surgeon can't necessarily correct all that, plus we have some asymmetries that cannot be corrected as well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The specialist also noted plastic surgery requires a 'lot of patience and a lot of ability to accept the unknown'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'You're going to be swollen for a while. You're going to heal a certain way. Nobody can predict exactly how the outcome is going to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a general idea, but it's in the 95 percent precision rate and that last five  percent is kind of random and you have to be willing to accept that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And you may not know for six months, 12 months, sometimes two years, what the final result is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;People with delusional expectations  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last few years, social media has convinced people that plastic surgery can completely 'fix' their problems and make them look perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lee highlighted that people who have a tendency to bleed easily during surgery should avoid an elective operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Lee says this is unrealistic and people shouldn't expect instant gratification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's important to understand it is impossible for plastic surgery to completely alter facial and bodily structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeon revealed: 'I've had a lot of cosmetic surgery myself. I had rhinoplasty, chin implant, whatever. I can't go into surgery expecting to look like Tom Cruise, no matter how much surgery I get.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also emphasized it is extremely important for patients to be grounded in reality as plastic surgery ideally cannot reverse signs of aging, improve relationships or alter any negative thought patterns about your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Easy bleeders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dr Lee highlighted that people who have a tendency to bleed easily or excessively should opt out of elective surgeries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that 'one in 10 people' have a tendency to bleed during surgery and while those with milder conditions, such as vitamin K deficiency, should treat those before seeking treatment, but other 'severe bleeders' need to be careful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conditions such as hemophilia - a condition where blood does not clot - and Von Willebrand disease - a genetic bleeding disorder caused by low levels of a clotting protein - may lead to prolonged and difficult-to-control bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An accumulation of cigarette smoke in the chest can also cause issues during the healing process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frequent cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can also cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can cause blood to thin and an accumulation of cigarette smoke in the chest can lead to complications during the healing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee explained: 'The big thing that we worry about related to bleeding during surgery is substance abuse, including cigarettes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's a huge one, because cigarette smoke and other smoke, but cigarette in particular has nicotine and carbon monoxide, tar, things that really clog up the oxygen flow to the healing areas and that can cause necrosis, meaning tissue death, poor scarring and a bad outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So you really should not smoke for almost any of these elective procedures. Alcohol, there's another one. Red wine causes bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Other types of alcohol can prolong the swelling phase, and sometimes, if it's swollen for too long of a period, you're not going to get a good result.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 20:12:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQVHkydkpVZGlCclRYV2xFV1dNZWFoRDNPOUpQOGpJaXRrb2dlSkxKN2FVLWhlaWtfS3V1N0RzVlJrX0Etekd5dTViV0dnaVE1bU9oRzR6X0d2ZmdUUEhuN0p6YVpTRm5RODNudWc3Q0VoalpnVVZmY3ZFX0tYeDRqZmxIZXpHb2ltcHlzN1hoLTNIdkw5OW5Za3ZMNUs0UdIBowFBVV95cUxPMXNoVDBKems4OExiVGhqaFN5djRBWmxCV1NOQlU4RWtJQXhDeGZvbExxZXU1S3JPc1JxVy1wX2pxbHZaMVM4X2dPNmxoUWNFemdzeWRCUmZzWmh0cG4wVTYwZ2Y5UEpfLVppSklmU1NBMHMtZVRYRFVhdC1yNVZFX2pBWGdnYkZHYXRua2MyZkpLakVoamQyVmpxS0RfM1hvZ3Q4</guid></item><item><title>Dendritic spines: The key to understanding how memories are linked in time - Phys.org</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE80Nlg4YmtVYXV5U2Nya3FNUVpVLXEwRW9ZdmtpcWRhOWRuT2JmbV9mWS1GUkc0ZDhlazVKU1BKN1hhbGFkX1dTWm1fdms1djJKTmMtSzcydGVHbGpXX1RfVDVYbmJtSXNpRXhhZHZZYVFVWXFxbmlnUkZTUdIBekFVX3lxTE1rVkdXeDhsN2RpcUR2QVpGeWlMWjk5aERoemhydmpqNVlQa0kxVWNVTW1lVVBBS1AxTmtrTUdDNUQ0ZEY5LWZESDRtanFqTERlSkNBd0tEOUszdlRyYkt2aDhKT185X2I5RmlyNHlvN0hhUHkxUHlYaXl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've ever noticed how memories from the same day seem connected while events from weeks apart feel separate, a new study reveals the reason: Our brains physically link memories that occur close in time not in the cell bodies of neurons, but rather in their spiny extensions called dendrites.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;This discovery stems from studies in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, in which researchers observed memory formation using advanced imaging techniques, including miniature microscopes that captured single-cell resolution in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/live+animals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;live animals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study shows that memories are stored in dendritic compartments: When one memory forms, the affected dendrites are primed to capture new information arriving within the next few hours, linking memories formed close in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you think of a neuron as a computer, dendrites are like tiny computers inside it, each performing its own calculations," said lead author Megha Sehgal, assistant professor of psychology at The Ohio State University. "This discovery shows that our brains can link information arriving close in time to the same dendritic location, expanding our understanding of how memories are organized."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01876-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; recently in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though most learning and memory studies have focused on how a single memory is formed in the brain, Sehgal's lab aims to determine how we organize multiple memories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The idea is that we don't form memories in isolation. You don't form a single memory. You use that memory, make a framework of memories, and then pull from that framework when you need to make adaptive decisions," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Neurons, the principal brain cells, are known to encode and relay information. Dendrites—the branch-like projections extending from neurons—serve a critical role in how information is processed, receiving incoming information and passing it to the neuronal cell body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But dendrites are not just passive conduits—each dendritic branch can act as an independent computational unit. While dendrites have been thought to play an important role in the brain's function, how they shape learning and memory has been unclear until now, Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mice were exposed in experiments to two different environments within a short period of time, the team found that memories of these spaces became linked. If mice received a mild shock in one of these spaces, the animals ended up freezing out of fear in both environments, associating the shock from one room with the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/retrosplenial+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;retrosplenial cortex&lt;/a&gt; (RSC), a brain region crucial for spatial and contextual memory. The researchers observed that linked memories consistently engaged the same groups of RSC neurons and their dendritic branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team tracked these changes at the dendritic level by visualizing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dendritic+spines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dendritic spines&lt;/a&gt;, tiny protrusions on dendrites where neurons communicate. The formation of new memories triggered the addition of clustered dendritic spines, a process critical for strengthening communication between neurons and facilitating learning.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spine clusters formed after the first memory were more likely to attract new spines during a second closely timed memory, physically linking those experiences in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm the role of dendrites in linking memories, the team used optogenetics, a technique that allows researchers to control neurons with light. By reactivating specific dendritic segments that had been active during &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/memory+formation/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;memory formation&lt;/a&gt;, they were able to link otherwise unrelated memories, further demonstrating the importance of dendritic changes in shaping memory networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to illuminating a previously unknown role for dendrites in linking memories, the findings open new avenues for understanding memory-related disorders, Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work not only expands our understanding of how memories are formed but also suggests exciting new possibilities for manipulating higher order memory processes," she said. "This could have implications for developing therapies for memory-related conditions such as Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;

The two topics are linked: The anti-seed-oils faction has turned to saturated fats as a replacement, based on the belief that these fats are more “natural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to a new study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831265" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in JAMA Internal Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at the association between varying consumption levels of either butter or plant-based oils (aka seed oils), and mortality levels, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63096101/signs-of-heart-disease-in-men/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a43774213/good-news-about-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; incidence over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nurse’s Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nurse’s Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, a large-scale study started in 1976, researchers analyzed the dietary habits of more than 220,000 adults. They collected the data through participants’ food frequency recalls to determine the amount of butter and/or plant-based oils in the participants’ diets over the course of roughly 30 years. (Researchers included safflower, soybean, corn, canola, and olive oils in the “plant-based” oils group.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were consistent with what previous research has already shown: People who ate the most butter had a 12% higher risk of developing cancer, and a 15% higher risk for all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the subjects who ate the most plant-based oils had a 16% lower risk for all-cause mortality, a 6% lower risk of death from heart disease, and 11% lower risk for cancer, which compounded the more plant-based oils were consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that substituting just 10 grams of butter a day—which is less than a tablespoon—for plant-based oil, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/dietary-habits-study-suggests-more-plant-oils-less-butter-lead-to-better-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:led to a 17% reduction in cancer deaths and all-cause mortality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;led to a 17% reduction in cancer deaths and all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conclusions seem aligned with what other studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However—and this is a big HOWEVER—there are some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it’s virtually impossible to draw a definitive link between specific diets—&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in a population—and health outcomes over time. Scientists just can’t keep people in a controlled lab environment for years of their lives. For long-term research like this, we have to rely on self-reported food intake, and at least some of that data may be inaccurate: People can forget, omit, or even lie about what they’ve been eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, other factors may muddle the link. People who eat more butter, for instance, may also do more of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things that increase their risk for disease. They may eat a more processed diet, be more sedentary, or be more likely &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a35213467/quitting-cigarettes-how-i-did-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to smoke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to smoke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, people's diets tend to change over time. (While researchers had participants fill out food frequency forms every four years, is this enough data to show the true nature of each person’s intake? Maybe or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Good Food, Bad Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982137509?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64255411%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$12.05 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$12.05 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, all of the participants in the study were nurses. Do they represent the general population? Also maybe or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential flaws in nutrition research as a whole, dietitians like myself look for reproducible effects and patterns. If we keep getting the same results over a series of similar studies, it’s likely that there is a true effect happening. In this case, it’s highly likely that a diet high in saturated fats is associated with a greater risk for disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we all need to avoid saturated fat; it simply means that a diet containing a mix of fats is probably the best for health (with the exception of trans fats, which are definitely harmful).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means favoring unsaturated fats (including seed oils like canola and soybean) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adding in some saturated fats like butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might not be the next hot food trend, but it’s the most effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:35:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE8zTm5DQU1uemtMckxhN2JvTmdwRmpROWxhZ3gzUnhsbWl6SnljZ1Zrclk1NkxWRUF0VE1KVHEzMGdxcVpYSFdOVHlzUXFTLVg3OUVlMHlwVFg0Ym1rVndVblFFVzdKUEk3bFBvZ08zbw</guid></item><item><title>An Uncertain Future for the County’s STI Clinic Stirs Outcry - Willamette Week</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQU1NXOHFUcFd0a2xjVFAtdzZuZkEwWE9ka1NZREUwdHFqQnlRRG1jZTZ1WklBTTdLaDNjS3NvVXRHU3d5YnZIZXo5TWxmV3ZrTWstMXd2NTRGeU1adHcwdzJma2EwNklzVjcwY1ltNkhGXzVMZ2NkU3YwQnV0dk5wSmZvdHdnMUdlVXRxd29yRG0tWm1UM0tXSy1YeDlEVzJ5V2lCLUtNaWY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="b-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Health care advocates are raising alarms over the possible shutdown of Multnomah County’s sexually transmitted infections clinic in Old Town. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Last month, the county health department listed the STI clinic’s $1.4 million annual budget among $9 million in cuts needed to reduce the department’s budget by 12%, as part of a budgeting exercise ordered by County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson. She asked departments to list what they’d cut to bridge the county’s $21 million budget shortfall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“In response to this significant budget challenge, the Health Department was asked to think strategically and concentrate on providing core services,” a Multnomah County spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;i&gt;WW&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fFsJJApdG78II"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The health department raised the possibility of eliminating the STI clinic altogether, closing its doors in June. The health department’s other clinics would be expected to pick up the STI clinic’s services, which include testing and treatment for illnesses such as HIV, syphilis and gonorrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Since then, the budget outlook has grown sunnier: The county only needs to trim $15 million, and the STI clinic is listed by the health department as its first priority to be saved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Still, those close to the program have in recent weeks expressed concern about its future, given that the county is in delicate negotiations with other governments over its homeless services budget, and its budgeting woes for that office could have a domino effect. Social media posts began circulating across platforms in February, urging voters to contact Vega Pederson and county commissioners about the clinic’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0f4sSS60cJYa3P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Eliminating this clinic is not just going to inconvenience or something like that—it’s going to cost lives in the long run,” says Jeanne Krinsley, who worked there for nearly 25 years. “We’ve spent decades building trust with people, especially with the LGBTQ+ community and immigrants. They’re not comfortable going to someone they don’t trust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The STI clinic has operated around Old Town since the 1960s and is currently housed in the Gladys McCoy Building on Northwest 6th Avenue. Last year, the clinic’s staff treated nearly 3,000 patients, and is on track to treat a similar caseload this year. Krinsley, who retired in 2023, not only treated and educated patients who contracted STIs through consensual encounters, but she also treated sexual assault victims, many of whom hadn’t told anyone else what happened to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“When someone says, ‘I’ve never told anyone that,’ that’s a real honor when someone confides in you like that,” Krinsley says. “Our patients—we’re supposed to call them ‘clients,’ but I don’t see what’s wrong with ‘patients’—just loved us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The medical specialty requires sensitivity toward patients of all backgrounds, including houseless people, people who don’t speak English fluently, and people navigating the complexities of American health care. Krinsley says she remembers the STI clinic leading treatment during the mpox outbreak of 2022 and staying open in 2020 for in-person care when primary care doctors pivoted to telehealth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“People trusted us, so they came in,” she says. “If we’re so unimportant, why were we still coming in?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Multnomah County’s STI clinic workers attempt to lower the barriers patients face when seeking treatment for STIs. Some clinicians visit sites like camps of houseless people to offer testing and treatment, a service that would be cut if the clinic had to close its doors. This keeps treatment accessible for people who might not be able to afford care without insurance, or who fear the stigma associated with STI testing. A familiar staff of expert providers also means patients have access to culturally competent clinicians who can help reassure them when their care leaves them physically or emotionally vulnerable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fHBQDiWeXl5zS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We had a guy who did not speak English who we spent a year trying to get into HIV treatment because he did not trust the medical system,” Krinsley says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Though new STI cases fell in Multnomah County in 2023 from their immediate post-pandemic spikes in 2020–22, the rates still remain around pre-pandemic highs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Vega Pederson said in a statement to &lt;i&gt;WW&lt;/i&gt; that she has not yet reached a final decision on the STI clinic’s future. She’ll propose a budget April 24, with the final budget to be approved in early June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Any cuts proposed by the department are provisional and meant to give myself and our board a range of options to consider,” she said. “We appreciate the patients, community members, and partner organizations who have contacted our office and testified to share their support for the services provided by the STI clinic. I share their passion for impactful public health initiatives and prevention efforts, especially as we see these services eroded at the federal level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Krinsley says in her experience that primary care providers can miss an STI’s early symptoms before they’re so obvious they require urgent care, which comes with a higher co-pay when patients have insurance. Symptoms can also go away without the infection resolving, leaving unsuspecting patients unaccounted for to risk spreading infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;broadstreet-zone zone-id="169550"&gt;&lt;/broadstreet-zone&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob" data-fusion-component="html-block-f0fWUJt8KR3m5Ob"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“HIV and syphilis can kill you down the line,” Krinsley says. Closing the clinic “is just not going to work very well. It’s just going to lead to a lot more disability and death, and it’s just so short-sighted because it’s going to lead to an increase in costs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Willamette Week</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQU1NXOHFUcFd0a2xjVFAtdzZuZkEwWE9ka1NZREUwdHFqQnlRRG1jZTZ1WklBTTdLaDNjS3NvVXRHU3d5YnZIZXo5TWxmV3ZrTWstMXd2NTRGeU1adHcwdzJma2EwNklzVjcwY1ltNkhGXzVMZ2NkU3YwQnV0dk5wSmZvdHdnMUdlVXRxd29yRG0tWm1UM0tXSy1YeDlEVzJ5V2lCLUtNaWY</guid></item><item><title>Oregon Man Sues Pet Food Company for Allegedly Killing His Cats With Bird Flu - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQQjlkR0wzVjk4cVJWblJTNlhfUmgwRFlOYUUycTh1bzFlZHltZndzbi1XeVd4YUJyZkVrenNWaGU0eXJYVzFmUHhMUFREd1hJM01RUFpjMDFjOXBvYXFVMDczYTlqOXg1OHlkTHZPX25iLXhSX21KaGVsdUVtV3BORXFSd3Q2ek5NbjFSaXEwMFdzQU1pYWlucUQwNkNEd0Qtd000Wkt0R251ZEVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A man in Oregon filed a lawsuit against Wild Coast Pet Food this week after his cat died from bird flu. The suit alleges the company misled consumers when it sold raw chicken cat food as healthy, failing to acknowledge potential risks, such as potential death from the consumption of H5N1-infected food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed by Tim Hanson, seeks just under $8,000 in damages which covers compensation for veterinarian bills and legal fees, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/regional/portland-man-sues-wild-coast-pet-food-cat-dies-bird-flu/283-983181c4-2d7f-4549-8239-6e72d29d4386"&gt;KTVB 7&lt;/a&gt; in Oregon. Hanson adopted his cat Kira in 2021 and told the news outlet he typically feeds his cats raw food like the chicken that killed his cat because “I believe in the health benefits of it.” It’s not entirely clear what health benefits Hanson believes can come from raw chicken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanson told KTVB 7 he bought the Wild Coast Pet Foods brand cat food in January but one day in early February Kira stopped eating. Hanson told the news outlet he brought her to the vet on Feb. 5 and a few days later tests confirmed Kira had bird flu.  Kira was so sick she had to be euthanized on Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wild Coast, which is based in Washington, issued a recall on March 1 for its 16 oz and 24 oz frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats. The food was sold in Washington and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The warning from the recall, which was posted on the FDA’s website:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who fed pets the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu in their pets, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness. People with pets exhibiting these signs after feeding this product should contact their veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spread of bird flu has been devastating for many cat owners, as they seem to be the most susceptible among domestic animals outside birds to H5N1. Many cats from New York to Oregon have been documented to have died from the disease and there are likely many more deaths that are going undetected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No humans in the U.S. have contracted bird flu from eating food, at least as far as health authorities can tell. But it does appear that cats are getting it from the consumption of raw food. U.S. health agencies have tested both milk and beef and it appears both are safe for human consumption even with the presence of bird flu as long as the milk is pasteurized and the beef is cooked to at least medium.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s also no evidence of human-to-human spread of the bird flu in the U.S. but there is concern a mutation could allow that to happen. There have been 70 cases of H5N1 documented in Americans with one death. Forty-one of those cases have been tied to dairy cattle, 24 have been traced to poultry farms, two cases are from backyard flocks and wild birds, and three cases are still unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wild Coast didn’t respond to questions emailed Friday. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have suspected for&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-evidence-suggests-parkinson-s-might-start-in-the-gut-before-spreading-to-the-brain"&gt; some time&lt;/a&gt; that the link between our gut and brain plays a role in the development of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="155632" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study identified gut microbes likely to be involved and linked them with decreased &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="155632" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B2) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin"&gt;biotin&lt;/a&gt; (vitamin B7), pointing the way to an unexpectedly &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9wuwZbPf0Vs"&gt;simple treatment that may help&lt;/a&gt;: B  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="155632" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Supplementation of riboflavin and/or biotin is likely to be beneficial in a subset of Parkinson's disease patients, in which gut dysbiosis plays pivotal roles," Nagoya University medical researcher Hiroshi Nishiwaki and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00724-z"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper published in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wuwZbPf0Vs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative disease impacts &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/parkinson-disease"&gt;almost 10 million people globally&lt;/a&gt;, who at best can hope for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-the-first-time-drug-shows-signs-of-slowing-parkinsons-disease"&gt;therapies that slow and alleviate symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin with constipation and sleep problems, up to 20 years before progressing into dementia and the debilitating loss of muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; found people with Parkinson's disease also experience changes in their microbiome long before other signs appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131231" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1.jpg" alt="Hands picking up a glass" class="size-full wp-image-131231" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-131231" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Parkinson's disease impacts almost 10 million people globally.

&lt;p&gt;While different groups of bacteria were involved in the different countries examined, they all influenced pathways that synthesize B vitamins in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the changes in gut bacteria communities were associated with a decrease in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin"&gt;biotin&lt;/a&gt; in people with Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145467" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145467" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642.jpg" alt="Graphic of human gut-brain connection and B vitamins" class="size-full wp-image-145467" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145467" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In Parkinson's disease, a reduction in the gut bacteria of genes responsible for synthesizing the essential B vitamins B2 and B7 was found.

&lt;p&gt;"Deficiencies in polyamines and SCFAs could lead to thinning of the intestinal mucus layer, increasing intestinal permeability, both of which have been observed in Parkinson's disease," Nishiwaki &lt;a href="https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/researchinfo/result-en/2024/06/20240618-01.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131227" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the process of gut bacteria depleting B vitamins and leading to symptoms of Parkinson's disease" class="wp-image-131227 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642-280x415.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642-600x888.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-131227" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Summary of findings from the study and speculations from previous research. (Nishiwaki et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00724-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Parkinson's Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They suspect the weakened protective layer exposes the intestinal nervous system to more of the toxins we now encounter more regularly. These include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dry-cleaning-chemical-could-be-major-cause-of-parkinsons-scientists-warn"&gt;cleaning chemicals,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-pathways-to-parkinsons-could-point-to-a-single-way-to-prevent-it"&gt;pesticides&lt;/a&gt;, and herbicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such toxins lead to the overproduction of α-synuclein fibrils – molecules &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106411"&gt;known to amass&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-detects-parkinsons-7-years-before-most-symptoms-show"&gt;dopamine-producing cells&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt; part of our brains, and increased nervous system inflammation, eventually leading to the more debilitating motor and dementia symptoms of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/BM4WLJBtjxF8Cx3wFsjFhKb/?lang=en"&gt;2003 study&lt;/a&gt; found high doses of riboflavin can assist in recovering some motor functions in patients who also eliminated red meat from their diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's possible that high doses of vitamin B may prevent some of the damage, Nishiwaki and team propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131228" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/VitaminBInBlood642.jpg" alt="Illustration of a vitamin B2 molecule in the blood.

(Nemes Laszlo/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all suggests ensuring patients have healthy gut microbiomes may also prove protective, as would &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/parkinsons-disease/can-environmental-toxins-cause-parkinson-disease"&gt;reducing the toxic pollutants&lt;/a&gt; in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with such a complicated chain of events involved in Parkinson's disease, not all patients likely experience the same causes, so each individual would need to be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We could perform gut microbiota analysis on patients or conduct fecal metabolite analysis," &lt;a href="https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/researchinfo/result-en/2024/06/20240618-01.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Nishiwak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using these findings, we could identify individuals with specific deficiencies and administer oral riboflavin and biotin supplements to those with decreased levels, potentially creating an effective treatment."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Indiana University and Wuhan University in China have unveiled a groundbreaking chemical process that could streamline the development of pharmaceutical compounds, chemical building blocks that influence how drugs interact with the body. Their &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/chem/abstract/S2451-9294(25)00078-6" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Chem&lt;/i&gt;, describes a novel light-driven reaction that efficiently produces tetrahydroisoquinolines, a group of chemicals that play a crucial role in medicinal chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Tetrahydroisoquinolines serve as the foundation for treatments targeting Parkinson's disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disorders. These compounds are commonly found in medications such as painkillers and drugs for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/high+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in natural sources like certain plants and marine organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, chemists have relied on well-established but limiting methods to synthesize these &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/molecules/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecules&lt;/a&gt;. The new research, co-authored by Kevin Brown, the James F. Jackson Professor of Chemistry in the College of Arts and Sciences at Indiana University Bloomington, and Professors Xiaotian Qi, Wang Wang, and Bodi Zhao of Wuhan University, presents a fundamentally different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it works: Light as a chemical tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of using traditional chemical reactions, scientists harness light to trigger a process called photoinduced energy transfer, wherein light initiates a controlled reaction between sulfonylimines (a type of chemical compound) and alkenes (another type of compound), leading to the creation of tetrahydroisoquinolines—a type of complex molecule. This method allows for the development of new structural patterns in the molecules, which were previously difficult or impossible to create using other methods, offering a more efficient way to make complex molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The key innovation in this study is the use of a light-activated catalyst, a special molecule that speeds up the reaction without being used up itself," said Professor Brown. "Traditional methods require high temperatures or strong acids—like trying to cook food with a blowtorch instead of a stove. These harsh conditions can sometimes create unwanted side reactions, or make the process less useful for certain chemicals. The new process, however, uses molecules that respond to light, and can bypass heating by access new energy states. This makes the reaction cleaner, more efficient, and less likely to create unwanted byproducts."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown and colleagues also found that tiny changes in the location of electrons within the starting materials had a huge impact on how the reaction played out—akin to if these electrons were puzzle pieces that needed to fit together just right. By tweaking the shapes of these pieces, the scientists made sure that only the desired product was formed, making the process highly selective. This is crucial for making medicines, where even a small mistake in a molecule's structure can turn a helpful drug into something useless or even harmful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Implications for medicine and other industries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ability to create a wider range of tetrahydroisoquinoline-based molecules means that medicinal chemists can now explore new drug candidates for treating diseases like Parkinson's, certain types of cancer, and heart conditions," noted Professor Qi. "Right now, some diseases have very few effective treatment options, and this method could help scientists discover new and better drugs more quickly."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond pharmaceuticals, this research could also impact other industries that rely on fine chemicals. In agriculture, for example, similar chemical reactions could be used to develop more effective pesticides or fertilizers. In &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/materials+science/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;materials science&lt;/a&gt;, it could help create new synthetic materials with specific properties, such as better durability and longevity and greater resistance to heat for the aerospace, automotive, electronics, and medical industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to fine-tune the reaction conditions, meaning, they will experiment with different ingredients and settings to make the improve the process further. They also aim to find out if this method can work on even more types of molecules, expanding its usefulness. In addition, they hope to partner with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/pharmaceutical+companies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pharmaceutical companies&lt;/a&gt; to test whether this technique can be used to produce medicines, potentially leading to new drug discoveries that could make a difference in people's lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This approach gives chemists a powerful new tool," said Professor Brown. "We hope especially it will open the door to the development of new and improved therapies for patients around the world."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the field of photochemistry continues to expand, innovations like this may redefine how medicines and essential chemicals are made, paving the way for faster, cleaner, and more efficient production methods.&lt;/p&gt;

And what’s even in them? Ahead, experts break down how these supps work, and whether you should take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do insulin resistance supplements work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, an insulin resistance supplement would help support insulin sensitivity. “Insulin sensitivity can be looked at as the amount of insulin required to push sugar/carbs into cells to make energy,” explains endocrinologist Rekha Kumar, MD. “More sensitivity means it requires less insulin, and insulin resistance means it takes more insulin to turn carbs to energy.” This balance is vital for keeping healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, these supplements are designed to help combat a range of health issues. “Poor insulin sensitivity—insulin resistance—can lead to high blood sugar and lipids, which increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease,” says Christoph Buettner, MD, PhD, chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance supplements are a pretty broad category, so they all work in different ways. Most of them have a range of ingredients that don’t tend to overlap, although there are a few that show up repeatedly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bitter Melon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few small studies suggest that the fruit extract bitter melon may help with lowering blood sugar levels. One randomized controlled trial of 90 people with type 2 diabetes found that levels of HbA1c (which measures average blood sugar levels over two to three months) didn’t change between the bitter melon and placebo groups after 12 weeks, per 2020 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229920302491" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Complementary Therapies in Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the average fasting glucose level of people in the bitter melon group went down during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another small trial on 76 people with prediabetes also found that bitter melon helped to lower glucose levels by suppressing levels of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537082/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glucagon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;glucagon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that stimulates the liver to release stores of glucose, according to 2022 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10050654/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food Science and Biotechnology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Food Science and Biotechnology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White Mulberry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaves from this tree are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/white-mulberry-leaf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NIH;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NIH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s some research that suggests white mulberry may lower blood glucose levels, according to a 2020 study in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229919317315" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Complementary Therapies in Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of this research is preliminary and not conducted on humans, per the NIH, so it’s hard to draw a definitive conclusion from them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready for resul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ts? &lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_strength_transformation_prep_amy_williams_a64218691" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for WH+ today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sign up for WH+ today&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for exclusive meal and strength training plans only available to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinnamon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon or cinnamon bark pops up in a few supplements, too, and there is some (also limited) research to back this up. One 2023 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://dmsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13098-023-01057-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diabetology &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Diabetology &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of existing research concluded that cinnamon could be an “add-on treatment” to control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62224378/the-impossibility-of-getting-a-pcos-diagnosis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another four-week randomized controlled trial of 18 people with prediabetes and obesity found that blood sugar levels were “significantly lower” when people had cinnamon beforehand, according to 2024 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000291652400008X" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers concluded that cinnamon may improve blood glucose control for those with obesity-related prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But none of the research on these ingredients is robust, making it tough to say for sure that the supplements do what they claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, can insulin resistance supps actually improve your blood sugar and help you lose weight?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are some pretty hefty promises, and experts are wary of them, especially because they haven’t been evaluated by the FDA. “There are no good studies or scientific evidence to show they make any dramatic difference,” in your blood sugar and weight, says Mir Ali, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, insulin sensitivity is a complicated process, and taking a supplement alone is unlikely to make a huge difference in your blood sugar and weight, adds integrative and functional medicine dietitian Lindsay Malone, RD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sure-fire way to improve your blood sugar and maintain your weight? Lifestyle changes: “No supplement will work unless you do,” Malone says. “Switching to a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a39628652/80-20-diet-low-glycemic-intermittent-fasting-weight-loss-success-story/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:low-glycemic diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;low-glycemic diet&lt;/a&gt;, eating whole, minimally processed foods, moving your body throughout the day, and getting &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63941290/blue-light-sleep-health-benefits-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adequate sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt; will address and fix the root cause of insulin resistance.” Reducing &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a27378711/weight-loss-success-story-simple-carbs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:simple carbs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;simple carbs&lt;/a&gt; like baked goods, soda, and cereal, for instance, can also help to keep your blood sugar levels stable, since your body breaks them down into glucose which could cause blood sugar spikes, Kumar says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which supplements are best for insulin resistance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts aren’t really on board with taking these new, buzzy, multi-ingredient supplements that claim to help with insulin resistance. However, a few vitamin and mineral supplements &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have some inherent benefits for insulin resistance and even weight loss, especially in people with endocrine or hormonal disorders like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11668966/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PCOS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PCOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts stress that these supplements are not magic pills. “Supplements alone are not a cure and often they do not do much,” Buettner says. But, again, with lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and regular movement, they may help support your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how they work, according to Malone:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carnitine. &lt;/strong&gt;Commonly sold as l-carnitine, this &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60956813/amino-acid-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amino acid;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amino acid&lt;/a&gt; helps your body use fat for energy, which can support weight loss efforts and may improve insulin sensitivity, according to Malone. In a 2020 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Nutrition ESPEN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Nutrition ESPEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 37 randomized controlled clinical trials, l-carnitine supplementation significantly decreased body weight, but there were no major effects on waist circumference or body fat percentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Omega-3;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Omega-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These healthy fats can reduce inflammation and “may also improve insulin sensitivity and assist with fat loss, especially belly fat,” Malone says. One small 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815739/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrición Hospitalaria;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nutrición Hospitalaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that omega-3 supplements “augmented” belly fat loss in overweight or obese people who were also on a weight loss diet, but more research is needed to determine whether omega-3 supplementation is effective for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40120300/vitamin-d-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “Low vitamin D levels are linked to insulin resistance, so supplementing with vitamin D can help improve sensitivity and potentially support weight loss,” Malone says. There’s a link between taking vitamin D and weight loss, as part of a larger treatment plan like a changed diet, per a 2018 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246883/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clinical Endocrinology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clinical Endocrinology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 2021 study in the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07315724.2021.1902879" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Nutrition Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of the American Nutrition Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acetyl-L-Carnitine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Courtesy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005P0UYGA?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64254355%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$27.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$27.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Omega-3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Courtesy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001GCU6KA?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64254355%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$12.29 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$12.29 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D3&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Courtesy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004U3Y8OM?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64254355%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$10.22 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$10.22 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re concerned about insulin resistance, it’s best to talk to a healthcare provider.

The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2024.102630" target="_blank"&gt;Ageing Research Reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, highlight connections between environmental factors and brain health as people age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a growing global concern, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. It encompasses a range of disorders that impair memory, thinking, and daily functioning, including Alzheimer’s disease. With an aging population and no available cure, finding ways to prevent or delay dementia has become a pressing goal in public health. While many studies have examined genetic and lifestyle factors, researchers are now turning their attention to environmental influences. Previous studies have hinted that elements such as air quality, traffic noise, and neighborhood design may affect brain health, but results have been inconsistent and often based on subjective reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, a team of researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. This means the researchers carefully examined and combined data from many previously published studies. A systematic review aims to gather all relevant evidence on a topic, while a meta-analysis uses statistical techniques to combine the results of those studies and provide a clearer picture of how strong the observed effects are. Only studies that used objective measures—such as satellite data, geographic information systems, and pollution monitoring—were included to ensure the most reliable results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My interest in this research topic is because of the urgent global challenge posed by dementia. As dementia affects millions of people and effective treatments remain limited, I was driven to explore modifiable risk factors that could help delay or even prevent cognitive decline,” said study author Linlin Da, a PhD student at the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I became particularly interested in investigating the role of the built environment, and how factors such as air pollution, urban design, and the availability of green spaces might influence cognitive health. By utilizing objective measures to assess these environmental exposures, I aimed to address inconsistencies in previous studies and contribute to a clearer understanding of how urban planning and environmental policies could support dementia prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers searched five major scientific databases and initially identified over 1,800 studies. After a thorough screening process, they selected 54 high-quality studies for their systematic review, 21 of which were also suitable for meta-analysis. The included studies came from around the world, with sample sizes ranging from under 200 to over 63 million individuals, most of whom were aged 60 and older. These studies measured environmental exposures like fine particulate matter in the air (known as PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide, proximity to green spaces, and access to local services. Outcomes included diagnosed dementia or measures of cognitive decline over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people exposed to higher levels of air pollution were more likely to develop dementia. Specifically, exposure to fine particulate matter—tiny particles that can be inhaled into the lungs and bloodstream—was associated with a 9% higher risk. Nitrogen dioxide exposure was linked to a 10% higher risk. Living near major roads, often a source of both air pollution and noise, was also tied to a 10% increase in dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, people living in neighborhoods with more green and blue spaces—such as parks, forests, rivers, or lakes—had a 6% lower risk of developing dementia. These areas were also associated with slower cognitive decline. Neighborhoods with more connected street layouts and better walkability also supported cognitive health, possibly by encouraging physical activity and social engagement. Access to food stores, community centers, and healthcare services was similarly beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these associations don’t prove direct cause and effect, they are consistent with what scientists already know about how the environment can affect the brain. Air pollution is known to cause inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, which can harm brain tissue and potentially contribute to dementia. On the other hand, green spaces may help protect the brain by reducing stress, encouraging exercise, and improving sleep—all of which are known to support cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did have some limitations. The researchers found considerable variation across the studies they analyzed. This so-called heterogeneity reflects differences in study designs, populations, and how environmental factors were measured. Some factors, like indoor air quality or socioeconomic status, were not always taken into account, and the methods used to estimate environmental exposure may not perfectly reflect individuals’ real-life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the authors emphasize that their findings provide strong evidence that environmental features play a meaningful role in brain health. By focusing on studies that used objective measurements and following participants over time, the researchers were able to offer a more reliable picture than many past efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Song hopes the findings will help shape future research and public health efforts. “These numbers show that living in a dementia-friendly environment is important to delay or prevent cognitive decline and the onset of dementia,” said Suhang Song, an assistant professor at the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urban planning decisions—like adding parks, improving air quality, and making neighborhoods more walkable—may offer a promising path toward protecting cognitive health at the population level. Future research may focus on how to better measure these environmental exposures over time, and how they interact with genetics, lifestyle, and other personal risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1568163724004483" target="_blank"&gt;Objectively measured environmental features and their association with cognition and dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Linlin Da, Xia Song, Zimu Jia, Nicholas Gary Lamont Myers, Jin Sun, Jingkai Wei, Daniel Jung, Feiyang Li, and Suhang Song.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 12:02:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQUjlJRDk0cjZ4YnNaN28xbUVaRXQzdVNXQmF2cTd2VjRTdFdwQXBsSU9oQW9SUzM2TEVfQ0pUOHJrTzF4RkNtbU9zM0M1VU82V2JWempuUmxqSFBPNmxjbWRTbFU4Z2pBUGQ2RVRlWDZBZnc0b0szSXZLT3dfN2hsdFhOTXJBZ2dGdW9FaVcxZ1AteEdYRFNhMQ</guid></item><item><title>Kennedy praises cell phone bans in schools, for science-backed and tenuous reasons - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxQSElwekJlQW93eFBoZDNFNW11c01wZVJkS3VHZVVFeEl1d29jQ25iYWFmTlZnWTZkUEItRmRnazlucUljdTBWclRfZTBHMzFneTNhX2YtN1JLNnBQSDdJMWRqbXN6bWllWlpIZ3NKLS00T3ZERFAtT0lqSXJyMkdNVGFOa21EcjB5cEF2Y1B30gFWQVVfeXFMUGpjLXhJVkFyZWVJckcxWVp1VkY2WGp3OVRVWXhYQVRnSmdSN2tSNWNfV1ZlaWNuYWRPWkpFU3EzUFdwcTRDNG9VVnV6NE1zVHRTaEJQM3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda: cell phones in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370269070112" target="_blank"&gt;an interview with “Fox &amp;amp; Friends”&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, Kennedy praised &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/state-lawmakers-bills-ban-cellphones-schools-rcna187309" target="_blank"&gt;cell phone restrictions in schools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244" target="_blank"&gt;listed health hazards&lt;/a&gt; that he said were linked to phone use among children and teens  — some backed by scientific research, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy cited established links between social media use and depression and poor school performance. But he also suggested that cell phones “produce electromagnetic radiation, which has been shown to do neurological damage to kids when it’s around them all day, and to cause cellular damage and even cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Studies have found that excessive use of social media via smartphones can &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2749480" target="_blank"&gt;negatively impact teens’ mental health&lt;/a&gt;, elevating their risk of depression and anxiety. Scientists have also long understood that cell phone use in school &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11894741/" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to poor academic performance&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213003993" target="_blank"&gt;lower grades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the bulk of research so far has found no association between cell phone use and cancer, nor evidence that cell phones damage DNA. Cell phones emit radio frequency radiation, which has far less energy than ionizing radiation, such as that released by medical X-rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy’s statements follow a pattern of his, in which he mixes misinformation with scientific fact. Some of the issues he has highlighted &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-first-month-health-secretary-vaccines-food-additives-rcna196042" target="_blank"&gt;during his first five-plus weeks in office&lt;/a&gt;, such as reducing chronic disease in children and warning of the dangers of ultraprocessed food, have broad support among the public and many scientists. But certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems and some of his proposed solutions — such as substituting &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/influencers-claim-beef-tallow-health-beauty-benefits-not-necessarily-e-rcna195206" target="_blank"&gt;beef tallow&lt;/a&gt; for seed oils in fast food — are not backed by research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;So, too, for cell phones in schools. Restricting their use is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Vivek Murthy, while he was surgeon general under the Biden Administration last year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html" target="_blank"&gt;called on schools to get rid of phones in the classroom&lt;/a&gt;. Nine states have already enacted such &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/" target="_blank"&gt;bans or restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, and 15 states and Washington, D.C. have introduced legislation to do so, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Both in red states and blue states, there’s a lot of concern about kids and cell phones, so I do think that there is bipartisan support on this,” said Annette Campbell Anderson, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, there’s no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cell phone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a lot of low-quality research in the literature that, if you wanted to collect all that and put it together, it would look very damning,” he said. “There are many activist groups out there that promote those studies and say that that’s the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What Kennedy says, and what studies say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims about the physical harms of cell phone use in the past, including &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3DQfcTY4viyXsIXQ89NXvg" target="_blank"&gt;on Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy also told Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., that he stood by his past statements that WiFi radiation causes cancer, saying that he had “won a case in front of the Court of Appeals against the FCC on that very issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, Children’s Health Defense, challenged the Federal Communications Commission’s decision not to review its 1996 health and safety guidelines for wireless-based technologies. An appeals court &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/filing/1041748778173" target="_blank"&gt;ruled in favor of the plaintiffs&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the FCC to explain how its guidelines protect against potentially harmful health effects. However, that case was about health issues unrelated to cancer, and the court did not take a position on the potential health effects of cell phone radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Research thus far has been “very reassuring” about cell phone safety, Bushberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cell phones could increase the risk of brain tumors, given that people often hold their phone by their head while talking. But overall brain cancer rates haven’t risen as cell phones have become more widely used. And &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974237/" target="_blank"&gt;a large study&lt;/a&gt; among children found no association between wireless phone use and brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/do-cell-phones-pose-health-hazard" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/non-ionizing-radiation-wireless-technology" target="_blank"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; — agencies that Kennedy now oversees — have all said there’s not enough scientific evidence to associate cell phone use with cancer. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic, meaning it cannot rule out a causal link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Several questions remain, said David McCormick, a biology professor at Illinois Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think it’s fairly clear that Mr. Kennedy doesn’t necessarily pay much attention to the bulk of the scientific data that is out there. That said, it’s not impossible that there are health effects from people using cell phones,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29217849/" target="_blank"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, McCormick and his fellow researchers exposed rodents to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29217848/" target="_blank"&gt;radio frequency radiation&lt;/a&gt; and found a possible increased rate of certain tumors — however, findings in lab animals don’t necessarily apply to humans, given the many biological differences, and the studies contained limitations that prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A decade earlier, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17636416/" target="_blank"&gt;study looked at cell phone use&lt;/a&gt; among more than 5,000 people with brain tumors and found a possible increased risk of tumors in the 10% who used their phones the most. But the research relied on people’s memories about past phone use, which aren’t always reliable, so its results (like those of similar studies) are hard to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cell phone use has also changed in recent years, McCormick said, which could affect exposure. Whereas studies thus far have mainly looked at the effects of 2G or 3G mobile signals, higher-frequency 5G networks are common today. And people now text as much if not more than they call, so there’s potentially less radiation near the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;The pros and cons of cell phone bans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite bipartisan support for cell phone restrictions in schools, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Phones can have life-saving benefits — for instance, by allowing children to call 911 — so some parents worry that outright bans could jeopardize their child’s safety. Anderson said policymakers have to weigh those concerns against risks to kids’ mental health and their ability to focus in the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Part of what schools are trying to do is figure out how to wrest back control over what happened in their school climates because of the phone — everything from using the phone to tape fights and incidents that happen in schools to kids using them to make TikToks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The right approach likely differs from school to school, she added — for instance, in schools where cell phones are the only internet-connected device, a ban may make less sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In his interview on Thursday, Kennedy applauded Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who last year issued an executive order directing the state’s education department to &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/july/name-1030522-en.html" target="_blank"&gt;draft guidance for public schools to restrict or eliminate phone use&lt;/a&gt; and set aside $500,000 to fund those efforts. Kennedy visited a Virginia high school on Monday that adopted the change, which he said students and teachers there have welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The states that are doing this have found that it is a much healthier environment when kids are not using cell phones in schools,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy suggested that although he personally supports getting phones out of schools, parents and teachers should make their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Do we really want the government to decide when, where, and how we communicate?” he &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1710023376360632465" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on X&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQSElwekJlQW93eFBoZDNFNW11c01wZVJkS3VHZVVFeEl1d29jQ25iYWFmTlZnWTZkUEItRmRnazlucUljdTBWclRfZTBHMzFneTNhX2YtN1JLNnBQSDdJMWRqbXN6bWllWlpIZ3NKLS00T3ZERFAtT0lqSXJyMkdNVGFOa21EcjB5cEF2Y1B30gFWQVVfeXFMUGpjLXhJVkFyZWVJckcxWVp1VkY2WGp3OVRVWXhYQVRnSmdSN2tSNWNfV1ZlaWNuYWRPWkpFU3EzUFdwcTRDNG9VVnV6NE1zVHRTaEJQM3c</guid></item><item><title>Allergy sufferers expected to have worse season than usual: See pollen maps - USA TODAY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNSEIxVkh4SzRuWncxNlBBd3BieGhGUW5jTVJVbmJJUzlubTlOb0IyTjZXelktVDJlVVI4LVB4OHBKaTA3WWNWLTk1eGYzc1FZZm1FQkd6UjJNMk9CY1V6TTVRa240cl9zNzFkanNqbnplNTctNzhjY3RzSzR2MXR2SVduaURVTExzcWR6RlVuNkZuMTdFWnFsbWZfa28tdERXTEgw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For trees and flowers, early spring might be wonderful, but for allergy sufferers, it can be awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Springtime has arrived two weeks earlier than usual in several Midwest states this year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.usanpn.org/data/maps/spring" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;USA National Phenology Network&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Arizona.

New Orleans also jumped considerably, going from 34th place the previous year to second in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Where are pollen counts at their highest?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As warm spring temperatures expand throughout the United States, pollen levels are rising. Pollen counts forecasted on March 20, the first official day of spring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why does pollen cause allergies?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Plants, trees and grass release pollen in the springtime to fertilize other plants of the same species. The powdery particles drift in the air and are easily inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In some people, inhaling pollen causes their immune systems to overreact. The immune system sees the pollen as a danger and releases antibodies that attack the allergens. This leads to the release of histamines into the blood. Histamines trigger runny noses, itchy eyes and other allergy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How pollen affects your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How to help stop the allergy symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Reducing your exposure to pollen allergens and identifying seasonal triggers might help ease your symptoms.

After narrowing it down to about 90,000 cannabis users and an equivalently sized group of non-users, the researchers found that the risks for heart attacks, stroke, and related deaths were substantially higher among the using group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ACC's statement, Kamel suggested cannabis legalization around the United States should lead doctors to ask their patients more questions about their pot use — especially given the &lt;a href="https://masscannabiscontrol.com/health-effects/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; that it's &lt;a href="https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Final-Study-No.-253.pdf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;not as risk-free&lt;/a&gt; as some advocates would have you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Asking about cannabis use should be part of clinicians' workup to understand patients' overall cardiovascular risk, similar to asking about smoking cigarettes," he said. "At a policy level, a fair warning should be made so that the people who are consuming cannabis know that there are risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are other factors to consider when it comes to weed, which is still &lt;a href="https://www.mpp.org/policy/federal/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;illegal on the federal level&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We should have some caution in interpreting the findings in that cannabis consumption is usually associated with other substances such as cocaine or other illicit drugs that are not accounted for," Kamel said. "Patients should be forthcoming with their doctors and remember that we are their number one advocate and having the full story matters."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the records Kamel and his team looked at also didn't differentiate between smoking pot and ingesting it in other forms, like edibles. They also didn't look at levels of cannabis use or doses — and anyone who has known true stoners can attest that there's a big difference between a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Hmd7zFG9M" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bong-ripper's choked coughing fits&lt;/a&gt; and the chilled-out bliss of those who occasionally pop indica gummies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this link is pretty alarming — and a good reminder that weed, unfortunately, doesn't seem to be consequence-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on weed:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientists-weed-cognitive-decline" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If You Blazed Massive Amounts of Weed as a Youth, Scientists Have Interesting News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:00:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9BdU95ajFoWnhwNXpQOTg4QkxiQmpfUjE5R0FZWlVSTHZFQVRCYy0xdEFOcjBHZVJzTF9SSkY1STdlX1hXVFl6T1JiWWIwd2Zpc1RMa3RVcWZ5ZC1sSDJaVDN1SFRDMXNTTGc</guid></item><item><title>The truth about ‘condoms for Gaza’: DOGE canceled $33 million USAID contract treating 350,000 HIV patients - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQeWVGYTJyOVVFOFhkSFNFQWg3T1RZcVhQdlR3bk1leFJrU200UDloWGtOMDVjaDdPZGVHbWFkMzdTVTdhNDlfSmZmYkh2dnc3bWhubXhFREJVd0E5bnhzTWxzQXBnWDNqUThjSU9CZ05OZ0FMUk15QnpYd0FuY001R0pYbloySEV3b0I0TFFjS3lkNGRPV2tucFBqempsdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQeWVGYTJyOVVFOFhkSFNFQWg3T1RZcVhQdlR3bk1leFJrU200UDloWGtOMDVjaDdPZGVHbWFkMzdTVTdhNDlfSmZmYkh2dnc3bWhubXhFREJVd0E5bnhzTWxzQXBnWDNqUThjSU9CZ05OZ0FMUk15QnpYd0FuY001R0pYbloySEV3b0I0TFFjS3lkNGRPV2tucFBqempsdw</guid></item><item><title>These Supplements Promise To Lower Blood Sugar And Help You Lose Weight—But Do They Work? - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQQnZQQzJCS3BTSThNbkswZE42ZzZIREVXTE1fSkxXcnVNeU5faTVfS0xhVDhNYjl2VDhvbGZCOGRYdFJMc1V5ZWk1eUVZaHBxcE1qaDl3blMwVGZ1ZjJhMzJIeUxXZFNBaFdPblg5clBTeTRvRUthbHRjNGlLSVc4MFlSN1ZwcHV0a2NpOU94OFZFc2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-j4k1z9 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Just like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a46052847/taylor-swift-eras-tour-training-workouts/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a46052847/taylor-swift-eras-tour-training-workouts/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Taylor Swift during her Eras Tour" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Taylor Swift during her Eras Tour&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a62230472/natural-glp-supplement/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a62230472/natural-glp-supplement/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weight loss supplements" data-node-id="0.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weight loss supplements&lt;/a&gt; are everywhere right now—and that includes insulin resistance supps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Supplement companies market insulin resistance supplements to help &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64245012/walking-blood-sugar-management-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64245012/walking-blood-sugar-management-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lower your blood sugar" data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;lower your blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, curb glucose spikes, support consistent energy levels, combat sugar cravings, and help you maintain a healthy weight.

And what’s even in them? Ahead, experts break down how these supps work, and whether you should take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-insulin-resistance-supplements-work" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;How do insulin resistance supplements work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In theory, an insulin resistance supplement would help support insulin sensitivity. “Insulin sensitivity can be looked at as the amount of insulin required to push sugar/carbs into cells to make energy,” explains endocrinologist Rekha Kumar, MD. “More sensitivity means it requires less insulin, and insulin resistance means it takes more insulin to turn carbs to energy.” This balance is vital for keeping healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As a result, these supplements are designed to help combat a range of health issues. “Poor insulin sensitivity—insulin resistance—can lead to high blood sugar and lipids, which increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="type 2 diabetes" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease,” says Christoph Buettner, MD, PhD, chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Insulin resistance supplements are a pretty broad category, so they all work in different ways. Most of them have a range of ingredients that don’t tend to overlap, although there are a few that show up repeatedly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Bitter Melon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;A few small studies suggest that the fruit extract bitter melon may help with lowering blood sugar levels. One randomized controlled trial of 90 people with type 2 diabetes found that levels of HbA1c (which measures average blood sugar levels over two to three months) didn’t change between the bitter melon and placebo groups after 12 weeks, per 2020 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229920302491" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229920302491" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Complementary Therapies in Medicine" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0.0"&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the average fasting glucose level of people in the bitter melon group went down during the trial. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another small trial on 76 people with prediabetes also found that bitter melon helped to lower glucose levels by suppressing levels of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537082/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537082/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="glucagon" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;glucagon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that stimulates the liver to release stores of glucose, according to 2022 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10050654/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10050654/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Food Science and Biotechnology" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.3.0.0"&gt;Food Science and Biotechnology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;White Mulberry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Leaves from this tree are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/white-mulberry-leaf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/white-mulberry-leaf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NIH" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;NIH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In a 2020 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clinical Nutrition ESPEN" data-node-id="34.0.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="34.0.4.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.0.4.0.0"&gt;Clinical Nutrition ESPEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 37 randomized controlled clinical trials, l-carnitine supplementation significantly decreased body weight, but there were no major effects on waist circumference or body fat percentage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="34.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.1.0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Omega-3" data-node-id="34.1.0.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Omega-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These healthy fats can reduce inflammation and “may also improve insulin sensitivity and assist with fat loss, especially belly fat,” Malone says. One small 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815739/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815739/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nutrición Hospitalaria" data-node-id="34.1.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="34.1.2.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.1.2.0.0"&gt;Nutrición Hospitalaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that omega-3 supplements “augmented” belly fat loss in overweight or obese people who were also on a weight loss diet, but more research is needed to determine whether omega-3 supplementation is effective for weight loss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="34.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.2.0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40120300/vitamin-d-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40120300/vitamin-d-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vitamin D" data-node-id="34.2.0.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “Low vitamin D levels are linked to insulin resistance, so supplementing with vitamin D can help improve sensitivity and potentially support weight loss,” Malone says. There’s a link between taking vitamin D and weight loss, as part of a larger treatment plan like a changed diet, per a 2018 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246883/"

During walks or runs, it may make you feel heavier, and during strength exercises, it can make the moves feel even tougher to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of weight vests, as my colleague found out when he &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-worked-out-with-a-weight-vest-for-a-week-and-it-kicked-my-ass" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-worked-out-with-a-weight-vest-for-a-week-and-it-kicked-my-ass"&gt;exercised with a weight vest for a week&lt;/a&gt; back in 2021. But the idea is simple: secure weights to your front and back and get to work.

For reference, I weigh roughly 57kg (around 125 lbs) and reach 5”2 in height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this isn’t an enormous amount of weight to add to your daily walk, it made me feel a little sluggish, and I certainly got a sweat on, especially when walking uphill. It definitely made my walk feel more challenging on my legs and core muscles, and I had to focus on bracing my stomach to prevent my lower back from taking the strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a few more hills than usual and found myself puffing as I strode along with my dog. It’s a simple way to add gentle conditioning to walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-balance-felt-off"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My balance felt off &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my colleague also reported, my balance felt slightly off from the change in weight distribution. However, the vest is strapped evenly around the torso rather than isolated to the wrists or ankles, so it doesn't put too much pressure on my joints. I also chose to avoid high-intensity or sudden changes in movement (think burpees), so it didn’t pose too much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had I opted for rucking — adding weight to a backpack on your back — I believe this would have put more pressure on my back, particularly the upper trapezius muscles that sit along either side of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-fitness-tracker-picked-up-on-the-difference"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My fitness tracker picked up on the difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a brisk walker, and with 7kg strapped to my torso, this brought a morning cardio element to my day. I noticed my calorie count was slightly higher, but I don’t check &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-just-did-a-500-calorie-hiit-workout-heres-how-many-calories-i-really-burned" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-just-did-a-500-calorie-hiit-workout-heres-how-many-calories-i-really-burned"&gt;calorie burn &lt;/a&gt;while I walk, as it can be an unreliable metric to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a competitive streak, so &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-closed-my-apple-watch-rings-for-an-entire-week-heres-what-i-learned" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-closed-my-apple-watch-rings-for-an-entire-week-heres-what-i-learned"&gt;closing my Apple ring&lt;/a&gt;s serves as a daily motivator for me; I tend to look at my overall movement for the day rather than individual workouts and their associated metrics — unless I’m going for a run and want to check my time and splits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulative energy expenditure, known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt; (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis), is a great way to naturally &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;burn calories &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/boost-your-metabolism-without-dieting-heres-how" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/boost-your-metabolism-without-dieting-heres-how"&gt;boost your metabolism. &lt;/a&gt;Walking with a weight vest just helped to ramp things up a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I noticed my heart rate increase with the intensity of the exercise without resorting to HIIT or running. That’s not to say it increased to the same level it would if I were out jogging, but &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/educ_hess_etds/58/" target="_blank" data-url="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/educ_hess_etds/58/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;have suggested that a weight vest can boost VO2 max during treadmill walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose to go rucking or walk with a weighted vest, you can combine low-impact resistance training with endurance and improve your daily energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-still-felt-meditative"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It still felt meditative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t forget, walking can also benefit your mental health. I recently started making a 5K walk a non-negotiable part of my routine, and I found it helpful for building better mental stamina. Thankfully, I still benefitted even while walking in a weight vest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-week-later-is-it-good-to-wear-a-weighted-vest-while-walking"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One week later — Is it good to wear a weighted vest while walking?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did weighted walking workouts do for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes much longer than a week to build noticeable differences in strength and fitness metrics, but I could feel my legs and trunk working much harder with the added weight, and I had to focus on core engagement to prevent my back from taking too much of the load. That said, a rucksack would have been even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually use my morning&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/i-took-a-mindful-walk-every-day-for-a-week-here-s-how-it-changed-my-mind-and-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/i-took-a-mindful-walk-every-day-for-a-week-here-s-how-it-changed-my-mind-and-body"&gt; 5K walks for mindfulness &lt;/a&gt;(and to exercise my four-year-old pooch), but a week of walking with a weighted vest felt more like a low-impact conditioning workout before starting my day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has plenty of benefits, aside from increasing your step count and getting you into nature, it can also improve various &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/the-5-components-of-physical-fitness-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/the-5-components-of-physical-fitness-you-need-to-know"&gt;components of fitness&lt;/a&gt; like cardiovascular health, which can decrease the risk of chronic conditions like high blood pressure while strengthening your muscles, bones, and joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make bodyweight strength workouts harder or add more intense cardio conditioning to your routine without going high-impact — a weight vest may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that walking with weights can also contribute toward bone loading — loading the bones with resistance to help build them up. One&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=tomsguide_us_6638888917789054658&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2FBF00435733&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Five-been-walking-with-a-weight-vest-for-5k-every-day-heres-what-happened-to-my-body" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00435733" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2FBF00435733&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Five-been-walking-with-a-weight-vest-for-5k-every-day-heres-what-happened-to-my-body" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; even found bone density increased by 1% when exercising in a weighted vest compared with a control group who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd need to continue testing this out daily for a few weeks to a few months to really notice the physical impacts. However, because wearing a weight vest during walks is low-impact, you can tick the boxes for consistency and frequency without overstraining your muscles and joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to start walking with weights, increase by a few kgs or lbs every few weeks as you get stronger and fitter, and try to keep your strides even without leaning too far forward as you walk. Think proud chest and strong core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My final verdict? A weighted vest for walks could help you slightly increase overall calorie burn, build strength and endurance, and increase the intensity of workouts, including walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s simple and affordable, too, but sometimes, I like to walk for pure enjoyment, so I’m not sure this is a challenge I’ll (quite literally) carry into my daily wellness routine going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom’s Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

They excluded studies that did not specify the type of wine and articles like literature reviews and experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They included 22 case-control studies and 20 cohort studies in the final meta-analysis. Researchers did subgroup analyses looking at wine type and cancer type when there were more than three studies regarding the cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also conducted analsyses only including the cohort studies since these have less bias risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven of the studies looked at site-specific cancer and consumption of red and white wine, while five only looked at red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When researchers compared the greatest to the lowest wine intake, they did not find an association between wine intake and cancer risk. They also did not observe a difference in how red wine or white wine affected cancer risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ec78" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eunyoung Cho&lt;/a&gt;, ScD, associate professor of epidemiology and dermatology at Brown School of Public Health, explained the following to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it’s well-known that alcohol (including wine) consumption increases the risk of cancer, many people consider red wine to be a healthier option due to its higher levels of antioxidants compared to white wine. However, there have been few large-scale studies directly comparing red wine to white wine in terms of cancer risk, which was why we decided to conduct this meta-analysis. Our findings revealed no significant difference in cancer risk between red and white wine overall. The main message is that there are no safe alcoholic beverages in terms of cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking only at cohort studies, researchers observed that white wine was associated with an increased risk for cancer, while red wine still lacked association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There did not appear to be a difference in cancer risk for red versus white wine in men. However, in women, white wine was associated with an increased risk for cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, researchers examined the dose-response relationship, including three cohort and 12 case-control studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that each additional 10 grams of estimated ethanol from red wine, or about one glass, consumed in a day “was associated with a 5% increase in overall cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when only looking at the cohort studies, this association did not persist. Researchers did not observe a significant dose-response relationship for white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When looking at specific cancers, researchers observed that white wine was associated with an increase in the risk of skin cancer by 22%. Researchers did not observe an association between skin cancer and red wine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin cancer was the only site-specific cancer that showed a significant difference in associated cancer risk when comparing red wine to white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red and white wine were associated with an increased risk for female breast cancer, but there was no significant difference in the associated risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when researchers estimated “what the summary effect size would be if there was no publication bias,” they found a small increase in overall cancer risk for red and white wine, with a possibly higher risk from white wine. However, researchers noted later in the paper that the summary estimates were similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meta-analysis has some limitations. The studies were observational, so the findings cannot show a causal relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies used self-reported food frequency questionnaires, and not all the studies used validated food frequency questionnaires. This could have led to misclassification and a minimization of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers acknowledge recall bias may be more likely to occur in case-control studies than in cohort studies but they also looked at the results examining only the cohort studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors only used two databases to conduct their literature search. They also faced potential limitations from their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the information they chose to extract from each of the included studies, and the methods they chose to use, as well as possible publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that the observed increase in skin cancer risk in white wine drinkers might be related to different demographic and lifestyle factors between white and red wine drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the included studies did account for other skin cancer risk factors, so the researchers suggest that the results likely reflect the true effect of white wine on skin cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some cancer sites, they only had a limited number of studies to examine. This meta-analysis also had the biggest sample size related to skin cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers acknowledge that this could have given them enough statistical power to see a difference between red and white wine consumption. This needed amount may have been lacking for the other cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also could only include a certain number of studies in the dose-response analyses, primarily case-control studies. Finally, the authors note, “[p]otential regression dilution bias in the included cohort studies might have also played a role in underestimating summary risk estimates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hendricks.org/physicians/details.aspx?sid=1&amp;amp;physician=615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Brian Black&lt;/a&gt;, DO, an osteopathic physician specializing in family medicine, who was not involved in this work, noted to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking at the study as I observe with nonsubstantial overall difference in risk of cancer between the two, it does challenge the stated popular perception that red wine is healthier. I found the limitations of the analysis include its observational design and wine-specific focus, rather than total alcohol intake. That constrains its ability to address broader alcohol-related cancer or health risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is room for further exploration in this area of study. More research into site-specific cancers and wine consumption will likely be helpful and more follow-up into the risk of skin cancer from white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cho noted that it is not entirely clear why they observed this result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“One possibility is that heavy alcohol consumption might be linked to high-risk behaviors, such as sunburn, indoor tanning, or insufficient sunscreen use,” she explained. “But it’s still unclear why white wine appears to be the key factor. Our study suggests that more research is needed to better understand the potential mechanisms behind this.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that a component of red wine is resveratrol and that some evidence supports its anticancer properties. Additionally, red wine has higher levels of resveratrol than white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this meta-analysis did not show that red wine decreased cancer risk. Researchers acknowledge that this may be due to the rapid metabolism of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/resveratrol-benefits" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;resveratrol&lt;/a&gt;, leading to low levels of resveratrol in the body after consuming red wine, which might not yield beneficial concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings suggest that red wine might not be a better choice compared to white wine when it comes to cancer risk. Cho noted that this “study, which is one of the first of its kind, challenges the belief that red wine is inherently healthier than white wine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:17:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNNGtSVDRxdTF2Z0duWGJIZGxWWUFhTUtsUlVUT3dVVjhXMkh5ZU1mSnlQNHZMX0NtWi1NOXZuY1VxeHJ6QlBQLVAyTTl3RXZMX2RKS1oxOXZmMW9vQkNHUEs4UUlOOFVHSUJKZzJWaUhNTFhRZmFyWkU5elZpbTFSM19EdlZ6Ul9pV1MyVVVCaVI0bDc5cGRWNFZYdXdmN2xaeEFDLU1oRGNWbExfSTNkZVFnQi1MVHhxSklMQ0d0aHQxd2tUdVow</guid></item><item><title>A longevity scientist who says he's reversed his age by 15 years shares the diet he follows — and 3 foods he avoids - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxPaW0xX0xCSTZRcnhudnZQSUpYR21wUkJuWkRtbWM0cUhUSHktWUw2bnpxMGJ2eDlfQ2haX1RVSVlvc214aGdXTVpza2FLQ0tTZ0hqVEpwTkdmVUMzcEhDaVp3cHhJcHlOLXZBU0pVVE5VRDBMclJJSUFka0F4LXBibUZWMmJxaFlFakVZcjdra1czU1lKcnJhSHNfMkRiUDNPZU9vSW1meEVhemhaVmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-content typography

There is no consensus on the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-the-maximum-age-of-humans-115-or-older-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;definition of biological age&lt;/a&gt; or how to measure it, so it differs according to the tests he refers to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, Verdin believes lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, sleep, stress management, and social connections, play a larger role in determining &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-lifestyle-changes-live-longer-healthy-habits-genes-study-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;how long we will live in good health&lt;/a&gt; than genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdin shared the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-diet-food-list-cheap-easy-2023-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt; diet he swears by for longevity&lt;/a&gt;, and the three foods he limits as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="df33d72a-30d2-43d9-aa42-469f511db45c" data-toc-id="df33d72a-30d2-43d9-aa42-469f511db45c"&gt;Swears by: eating a Mediterranean-style diet &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verdin said that there's strong evidence to suggest eating a good balance of complex carbohydrates — such as sweet potatoes — fats, and proteins is essential for health.&lt;/p&gt;

So you can drink several pieces of fruit in seconds, which you wouldn't be able to do if you ate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consume sugary foods or beverages, our blood sugar spikes and the pancreas needs to release more insulin to balance it. With repeated spikes, after a period of time the pancreas may not be able to keep up with production needed, which can lead to insulin resistance, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber, which is great for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-health-boost-overall-digestion-better-moods-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, also delays the absorption of the sugar therefore &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-carbs-without-blood-sugar-spikes-2024-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;preventing blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat an orange, the sugar comes in at a much slower rate.

"So I never went back," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He'll still have the odd glass of wine on a special occasion but he rarely drinks these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the World Health Organization said that "no level of alcohol consumption is safe when it comes to human health," and the US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy published an advisory bringing awareness to&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general-report-smoking-cigarettes-obesity-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt; alcohol's links to cancer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory said alcohol consumption was the third leading &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-risks-young-people-reduce-diet-alcohol-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;preventable cause of cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the US, after tobacco and obesity and recommended advocated for warning labels on alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
