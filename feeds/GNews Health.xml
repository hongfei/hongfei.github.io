                    &lt;p&gt;Birding enthusiasts in Indiana have been struck by the loss of an estimated 1,500 Sandhill Cranes. The deaths of the popular birds has been attributed to Avian Influenza, or bird flu, by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cranes congregate in several areas of the state including west of South Bend, Indiana where they have access to open water and food. Some winter in the area along with isolated areas of Southern Michigan instead of migrating south for the winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indiana DNR's Marty Benson said in a short message to Newsmax that the &lt;br&gt;
total number of stricken cranes is not known. The department estimates 1,500 in total, with at least 100 in an area surrounding the frozen Fish Lake in the Northwest corner of the state. He pointed to a department press &lt;a href="https://events.in.gov/event/avian-influenza-detected-in-waterfowl-in-multiple-indiana-counties" target="_blank"&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; in January that indicated widespread incidents of bird flu detected in wild birds throughout a ten-county area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Benson said, "Since 2022, there have been more than 125 positive detections of HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) in waterfowl across the state." The death count of afflicted Sandhill Cranes from this most recent event may be higher as wildlife biologists continue to survey the area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandhill Cranes are &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/sandhill-crane" target="_blank"&gt;popular&lt;/a&gt; with birding enthusiasts. When flying, their calls can sometimes be heard from a mile or more away. Many communities hold events to bring attention to areas where they congregate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Michigan, the State Department of Natural Resources &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/about/newsroom/releases/2025/02/11/dnr-suspects-bird-flu-in-recent-lower-michigan-waterfowl-die-offs" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the recent deaths of at least 300 wild birds including Canada Geese across a five county area of the state's Southern Lower Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avian Influenza is considered a primary &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;factor&lt;/a&gt; in the deaths and euthanization of millions of egg-laying chickens and the subsequent increase in retail egg prices throughout America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In 2023, neurologists at a memory clinic in China diagnosed a 19-year-old with what they believed to be  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="153739" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease&lt;span&gt;, making him the youngest person ever to be diagnosed with the condition in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The male teenager began experiencing memory decline around age 17, and the cognitive losses only worsened over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imaging of the patient's brain showed shrinkage in the hippocampus, which is involved in memory, and his cerebrospinal fluid hinted at common markers of this most common form of dementia&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often thought of as an old person's ailment, and yet early-onset cases, which include patients under the age of 65, account for up to 10 percent of all diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_136965" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136965" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-642x260.jpg" alt="older woman in a care home" class="wp-image-136965 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/older_woman_home_AD.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-136965" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is today an incredibly common disease among older people, but it's comparatively rare in the young. (zeljkosantrac/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost all patients under 30 years of age can have their Alzheimer's explained by pathological gene mutations, putting them into the category of familial Alzheimer's disease (&lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/early-onset-familial-ad/overview/what-early-onset-familial-alzheimer-disease-efad"&gt;FAD&lt;/a&gt;). The younger a person is when they receive a diagnosis, the more likely it is the result of a faulty gene they've inherited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet researchers at the Capital Medical University in Beijing couldn't find any of the usual mutations responsible for the early onset of memory loss, nor any suspect genes when they performed a genome-wide search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before this diagnosis in China, &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/34366350"&gt;the youngest patient with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; was 21 years old. They carried the &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/psen1/"&gt;PSEN1 gene mutation&lt;/a&gt;, which causes abnormal proteins to build up in the brain, forming clumps of toxic plaques, a common feature of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases like the one in China pose something of a mystery. None of the 19-year-old's family had a history of Alzheimer's or dementia, making it hard to categorize as FAD, yet the teenager had no other diseases, infections, or head trauma that could explain his sudden cognitive decline either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years before being referred to the memory clinic, the teenage patient began struggling to focus in class. Reading also became difficult and his short-term memory declined. Oftentimes, he couldn't remember events from the day before, and he was always misplacing his belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_89131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89131" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-642x260.jpg" alt="Depressive Symptoms And Memory Loss in Older Adults Linked to Telomere Shortening" class="wp-image-89131 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/03/TelomeresCognitiveDecline-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-89131" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Patients over 65 account for the vast majority of AD cases. (Maskot/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the cognitive decline became so bad, the young man was unable to finish high school, although he could still live independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year after being referred to the memory clinic, he showed losses in immediate recall, short-delay recall after three minutes, and long-delay recall after 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient's full-scale memory score was 82 percent lower than that of peers his own age, while his immediate memory score was 87 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term follow-up is needed to support the young man's diagnosis, but his medical team &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; at the time the patient was "altering our understanding of the typical age of onset of AD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The patient had very early-onset AD with no clear pathogenic mutations," &lt;span&gt;neurologist Jianping Jia and colleagues &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065"&gt;wrote in their study&lt;/a&gt;, "which suggests that its pathogenesis still needs to be explored."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case study, published in February 2023, just goes to show that Alzheimer's doesn't follow a single pathway, and is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-says"&gt;much more complex&lt;/a&gt; than we thought, emerging &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-splits-alzheimer-s-into-three-subtypes-and-it-might-help-us-treat-it-better"&gt;via numerous avenues&lt;/a&gt; with varying effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3209607/chinese-diagnosis-worlds-youngest-person-probable-alzheimers-set-change-thinking-about-disease?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;amp;pgtype=article&amp;amp;campaign=3209607"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; to the South China Morning Post, the neurologists who described the patient's case argued that future studies should focus on early-onset cases to further improve our understanding of memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Exploring the mysteries of young people with Alzheimer's disease may become one of the most challenging scientific questions of the future," they &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3209607/chinese-diagnosis-worlds-youngest-person-probable-alzheimers-set-change-thinking-about-disease?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;amp;pgtype=article&amp;amp;campaign=3209607"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Alzheimer's Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in February 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The outbreak continues to be mainly in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a press briefing hosted by the city of Lubbock, Texas, on Friday, Ron Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, offered a stark warning for Texans in his opening statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“What I want you to hear is: It's not good to go have measles parties because what may happen is—we can't predict who's going to do poorly with measles, be hospitalized, potentially get pneumonia or encephalitis and or pass away from this,” Cook said. “So that's a foolish idea to go have a measles party. The best thing to do is make sure that you're well vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Lubbock sits about 90 miles northwest of the outbreak's epicenter &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-erupts-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/"&gt;in Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, which is one of the state's least vaccinated counties. It has recorded 98 of the outbreak's 146 cases. While Lubbock has only reported two of the 146 cases, patients from elsewhere have been treated in Lubbock. That includes the first two cases in the outbreak as well as the child who died of the infection earlier this week, who was not a resident of Lubbock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;It's unclear if any measles parties are occurring in Gaines or elsewhere. “It's mostly been ... social media talk,” Cook said in response to a follow-up question from Ars. He noted that measles parties and chickenpox parties were more common practices decades ago, before vaccines for both diseases were available. But he again warned about the dangers today. “Please don't do that. It's just foolishness; it's playing roulette,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Cook, along with Lubbock's director of public health, Katherine Wells, said they see no end in sight for the outbreak, which now spans nine counties in Texas, many of which have low vaccination rates. “This outbreak is going to continue to grow,” Wells said, declining to forecast how high the final case count could go after a reporter raised the possibility of several hundred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;So far, 116 of the 146 cases are under the age of 18, with 46 being 4 or under. Only five of the 146 were vaccinated with at least one dose of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;On a more positive note, Wells reported that the outbreak has seemed to sway some vaccine-hesitant parents to get their children vaccinated. Just yesterday in Lubbock, over 50 children came into the city's clinic for measles vaccines. Eleven of those children had vaccine exemptions, meaning their parents had previously gone through the state process to exempt their child from having to receive routine childhood vaccines to attend school. “Which is a really good sign; that means our message is getting out there,” Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;So far in the outbreak, which erupted in late January, messaging about the disease and the importance of vaccination has exclusively come from state and local authorities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only released &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html"&gt;a brief statement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday, which was not sent through the agency's press distribution list. It did, however, note that “vaccination remains the best defense against measles infection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;During a cabinet meeting Wednesday, US health secretary and anti-vaccine advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to a question about the outbreak, offering a variety of inaccurate information. Kennedy downplayed the outbreak, falsely claiming that “it's not unusual.” Actually, this is an unusual year for measles in the US. As epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina noted on Bluesky, the number of US measles cases this year has already &lt;a data-offer-url="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h"}' href="https://bsky.app/profile/kkjetelina.bsky.social/post/3lj45miduzk2h" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;surpassed the total case counts from eight of the previous 15 years&lt;/a&gt;.

Last year, there were 16. It is not unusual. We have measles outbreaks every year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The remark sparked outcry from critics who said Kennedy was downplaying the severity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Physicians have set off alarm bells about the outbreak that has affected 100 people in West Texas and New Mexico. The measles had been declared eliminated in America in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;State officials said that the child who died in Texas was “school-aged” and unvaccinated. The last-known previous death from measles was in 2015, when an immunocompromised adult woman &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/woman-dies-measles-first-us-death-12-years-n385946" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:succumbed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;succumbed&lt;/a&gt; to the disease.

&lt;p&gt;Taters and toast could be tooth trouble in disguise. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/13/2/461" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the number of AMY1 gene copies you have plays a crucial role in how the bacteria in your mouth respond to starch, potentially increasing the risk of cavities and gum disease for some people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Most people have been warned that if you eat a bunch of sugar, make sure you brush your teeth,” &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/02/do-starchy-carbs-cause-cavities" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Angela Poole&lt;/a&gt;, senior author and assistant professor of molecular nutrition at Cornell University. “The takeaway finding here is that depending on your AMY1 copy number, you may want to be just as vigilant about brushing your teeth after eating those digestible starches.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The findings could pave the way to more personalized dental care.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;RomanR – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Poor oral health can wreck havoc throughout the body.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Kay Abrahams/peopleimages.com – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMY1 gene is responsible for producing salivary amylase, an enzyme that helps digest starch in the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have linked AMY1 to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/21/new-treatment-for-cavities-is-easier-more-effective-study/"&gt;cavities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/02/cutting-daily-calories-could-help-reduce-gum-disease-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, scientists haven’t fully understood how salivary amylase interacts with starch to disrupt the oral microbiome and increase the odds of dental disaster. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s what we wanted to know in this experiment. What’s going on in the mouth if someone eats starch, and is the answer different if their copy number is high or it’s low?” Poole said. “What we found was that there are other bacteria involved in these processes and that the changes depended on AMY1.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers collected saliva samples from 31 adults, each with different AMY1 copy numbers. They then added starch to the cultured samples, or biofilms, and observed how the bacterial makeup shifted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In samples with high AMY1 numbers, the team found that starch significantly reduced the proportions of two bacteria — Atopobium and Veillonella — while Streptococcus levels increased. All three bacteria are associated with tooth decay or gum disease, according to Poole. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Some increased and some decreased, so it’s not so straightforward as saying, ‘The whole thing is good or bad,’” Poole said. “It’s an interaction, but it looks like the AMY1 copy number, as well as which species are present in people’s mouths when they eat starch, is affecting the risk for developing these diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Your body breaks down starchy foods into glucose, which fuels all tissues and organs with the energy. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;M.studio – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study findings don’t mean you should ditch starch from your diet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For most people, starchy foods are a important source of carbohydrates and play a vital role in a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/starchy-foods"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; when eaten in moderation. They provide energy and fiber, along with essential vitamins and minerals. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/high-starch-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Starch-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; include bread, cereals, pasta, rice, potatoes, beans, corn and even bananas. People with higher AMY1 copies &lt;a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2018/10/18/did-eating-starchy-foods-give-humans-an-evolutionary-advantage--.html#:~:text=People%20with%20more%20copies%20of,pasta%2C%20but%20not%20sugary%20foods." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;have an easier time breaking down starchy foods&lt;/a&gt; — a genetic variation that researchers believe evolved in certain groups over time.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“The populations that historically had greater access to starch tend to have more copies,” Poole said, “which makes sense from a practical standpoint, because it would have given you a survival advantage when food is scarce, to be able to break down those starches more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this may have its benefits, Poole said the study also points to potential downsides for your teeth and gums. “If someone has a high copy number, they break down starch efficiently, and bacteria that like those sugars are going to grow more in that person’s mouth,” she noted. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research could open the door to more personalized dental care. By understanding your genetic makeup, dentists might one day offer recommendations tailored to your individual risks when it comes to starch metabolism and oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result? A happier mouth and a healthier you. After all, tooth decay and gum disease don’t just mess with your smile or make eating and talking a challenge — they can affect your entire well-being.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor oral health has been &lt;a href="https://penndentalmedicine.org/blog/how-dental-health-affects-overall-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;linked to a range of serious conditions&lt;/a&gt;, including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and certain cancers. Experts believe the issue lies with bacteria from the mouth entering the bloodstream, triggering inflammation that spreads throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/apa-blogs/how-dental-health-and-mental-health-are-connected" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dental and mental health are closely connected as well&lt;/a&gt;. Struggling with issues like gum disease or tooth decay can trigger feelings of embarrassment, low self-esteem, and anxiety, often leading to social isolation and a decline in overall quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cat in New Jersey was euthanized after becoming severely ill from a confirmed case of &lt;a href="https://6abc.com/tag/bird-flu/" data-testid="prism-linkbase"&gt;bird flu&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s health department said Friday.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cat was not exposed to infected poultry, livestock, raw milk or meat.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was allowed to roam outdoors, so it’s not known if it had exposure to wild birds or other animals.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other cats on the property in Hunterdon County are also ill.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 100 domestic cats have been infected with bird flu since 2022 across the country, according to the USDA’s latest figures. Thirty-five of those infections occurred in just the past two months this year.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No human cases have been linked to exposure to infected cats.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey Health Department is recommending the following steps to protect pets:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Do not feed cats raw (unpasteurized) milk or dairy products, and avoid feeding any raw or undercooked meat treats or diets.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Keep cats indoors to prevent exposure to birds and other wildlife.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Keep cats away from livestock, poultry, and their environments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Avoid contact with sick or dead birds and other wildlife yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Thoroughly wash your hands after handling your cat and after any encounters with poultry, livestock, or wild birds and other animals.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Change your clothes and shoes, and thoroughly wash any exposed skin, after interacting with sick or dead animals that may harbor the H5N1 virus, and before interacting with your cat.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Contact a veterinarian if you notice signs of H5 HPAI or think your cat might have been exposed to the virus.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The tropical fruit has long been a staple in traditional medicine across Central and South America, known for its supposed antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and even anticancer properties. But are all these purported benefits of the fruit backed by science?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's understand the nutrition factor first. The fruit despite its rough and tough appearance has a brilliant taste and many compare it to strawberry and banana. A cup of soursop fruit has 148 calories, 7.42 g of fibre, 37.8 g of carbohydrates, and 30.5 g of sugar. Being a low glycemic index, it's great for people with diabetes. The fruit is abundant in vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, as well as antioxidants, and potassium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Native to Central and Southern America, soursop has been used in traditional medicine to manage diabetes, treat infections and even cancers. The soursop fruit or leaves have also been used to treat stomach ailments, fever, parasitic infections, hypertension and rheumatism. Many claims say soursop tea or extract can slow the spread of cancer, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support this claim. Only limited, lab-based research has pointed to the fruit's ability to fight cancer, however, the same hasn't been studied in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is soursop effective in killing cancer cells? What the research says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry found the soursop compounds could destroy the breast cancer cells and were even more effective than chemotherapy. Another study published in 2016 in Scientific Reports found that soursop had anticancer activity on prostate cancer cells. However, the study was done on mice, and not humans. A 2024 review paper found that soursop extracts show promise in fighting cancer, with compounds that kill cancer cells while sparing healthy ones. The review also highlighted anti-inflammatory benefits, suggesting that soursop’s long-standing use in traditional medicine may have some scientific basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists find that certain bioactive compounds like acetogenins, alkaloids, flavonoids and vitamins in the fruit have been found to be effective in killing cancer cells. These acetogenins have also been linked with not just blocking cancer growth but cancer prevention. A key acetogenin, annonacin, has also been linked to Parkinson's and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can soursop raise risk of neurodegenerative disorders?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study published in the journal Molecules warned that high doses of acetogenins, found in soursop, could be neurotoxic and may contribute to neurodegenerative disorders. Some of the fruit’s alkaloids may also affect nerve cells, especially with prolonged or excessive consumption. Researchers emphasized the need for further studies and clinical trials to fully understand soursop’s safety and medicinal potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of soursop&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High in antioxidants&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet and delicious fruit can also deliver a wealth of antioxidants to your body, which have disease-fighting potential.

                    &lt;p&gt;DALLAS (AP) — The number of people with measles in Texas increased to 146 in an outbreak that led this week to the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of cases — Texas’ largest in nearly 30 years — increased by 22 since Tuesday. The Texas Department of State Health Services said cases span over nine counties in Texas, including almost 100 in Gaines County, and 20 patients have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-to-know-about-highly-contagious-measles-and-how-to-protect-yourself"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about highly contagious measles and how to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The child who died Tuesday night in the outbreak is the first U.S. death from the highly contagious but preventable respiratory disease since 2015, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The child was treated at Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, though the facility said the patient didn’t live in Lubbock County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nation’s top health official and a vaccine critic, said Wednesday that the U.S. Department of the Health and Human Services was watching cases but dismissed the outbreak as “not unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Friday afternoon, Kennedy said in a post on X that his heart went out to families impacted by the outbreak, and he recognized “the serious impact of this outbreak on families, children, and healthcare workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy went on to say in the post that his agency will continue to fund Texas’ immunization program and that ending the outbreak is a “top priority” for him and his team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus has largely spread through rural, oil rig-dotted West Texas, with cases concentrated in a “close-knit, undervaccinated” Mennonite community, state health department spokesperson Lara Anton has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has a strong homeschooling and private school community. It is also home to one of the highest rates of school-aged children in Texas who have opted out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14 percent skipping a required dose last school year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas law allows children to get an exemption from school vaccines for reasons of conscience, including religious beliefs. Anton has said the number of unvaccinated kids in Gaines County is likely significantly higher because homeschooled children’s data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/west-texas-measles-outbreak-spreads-amid-vaccine-hesitancy-in-some-communities"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WATCH:&lt;/strong&gt; West Texas measles outbreak spreads amid vaccine hesitancy in some communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing infection and severe cases. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95 percent vaccination threshold for kindergartners — the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. had considered measles, a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours, eliminated in 2000, which meant there had been a halt in continuous spread of the disease for at least a year. Measles cases rose in 2024, including a Chicago outbreak that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eastern New Mexico has nine cases of measles currently, but the state health department said there is no connection to the outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a news conference Friday in Austin, officials confirmed the first reported case in Travis County since 2019. Dr. Desmar Walkes of the Austin-Travis County Health Authority said the case involved an unvaccinated infant who was exposed to the virus during a vacation overseas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services spokesman Chris Van Deusen said the case was one of four linked to international travel so far this year, none of which were part of the West Texas outbreak. The others were two in Houston last month and one reported this week in Rockwall County, east of Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Travis County case, the child’s family members were vaccinated and were isolating at home and no exposures were expected, Walkes said. She could not give the exact age of the infant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the news conference urged people to get vaccinated if they are not already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re here to say quite simply: Measles can kill, ignorance can kill and vaccine denial definitely kills,” said U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School officials in two Texas cities each reported reported one rubella case this week, but Van Deusen said no infections had been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;

            Authorities investigating the deaths of at least 60 people in northwestern Congo suspect the water source in one of the areas may have been contaminated, the World Health Organization said Friday. But the agency said it’s too early for any definitive conclusion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00033b6mn4nzgezd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors are investigating more than 1,000 &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/congo-disease-equateur-outbreak-9bd3dc848d3c1ae6196f1d194f56f7bd" target="_blank"&gt;illnesses&lt;/a&gt; that emerged since late January in five villages in Congo’s Equateur province, where high rates of malaria have complicated efforts to diagnose the cases and where officials have said they’ve been unable so far to confirm the main cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00043b6m2mjy9njd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan said during an online briefing Friday that for one of the villages there is “a very strong level of suspicion of a poisoning event related to the poisoning of a water source.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00053b6m0t6zpprq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ryan did not clarify whether he was referring to contamination by accident, negligence or deliberate action. He also did not identify the village where the poisoning was suspected.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8xfn00013b6mvwflkbic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We will not stop investigating until we are sure that the true cause or the absolute cause of what is occurring here is fully investigated,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00063b6muwpccet2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Illnesses were first detected in late January in the village of Boloko after three children ate a bat and died within 48 hours.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00073b6mjeutq9ek@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twelve cases and eight deaths in total have been recorded in Boloko, with no new cases recorded since January, officials say, adding that nearly half of deaths there occurred within hours of the onset of symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00083b6mx12d1ac3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The village of Bomate in Basankusu health zone, around 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Boloko, has been hit the most: 98% of the cases and 86% of deaths have been recorded there, health officials say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku00093b6m74lz1so1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            WHO said on Thursday that hundreds of the patients have tested positive for malaria, which is common in the region. In addition to common malaria symptoms such as fever and body aches, patients have also shown symptoms like chills, sweating, stiff neck, runny or bleeding nose, cough, vomiting and diarrhea.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000a3b6m781nzzr8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The health crisis has caused fear among residents, some of whom have said they fled the villages to avoid falling sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000b3b6mctuj5oyn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say access to the sick has been hindered by the remote locations of the affected villages and that several people died before medical teams were able to reach them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8yku000e3b6m0dc4rpvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Clearly, at the centre of this, we have some kind of poisoning event,” Ryan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8ykv000f3b6mhc0np41b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another likely suspect could be a “toxic-type event either from a biological perspective like meningitis or from a chemical exposure,” the WHO emergencies chief said, citing systematic investigations carried out so far by experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7qh8ykv000g3b6mfuvxujdw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials, though, haven’t been able to confirm the main cause of the illnesses, he said, adding that the high rates of malaria and other common illnesses in the villages are making it difficult to determine the cause.

For example, fat cells, also called adipocytes, and immune cells work in concert to communicate with the brain, muscles and liver.

However, one of the many aspects of obesity that have left scientists puzzled is that not all fat is created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral fat — fat cells that reside in the abdomen close to the internal organs — is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.922931/full" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked to a greater risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of various health problems than fat under the skin, known as subcutaneous fat. For example, excess visceral fat comes with a heightened risk of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/heart-circulation/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heart attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stroke&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, diabetes, insulin resistance and liver disease. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." target="_blank" data-url="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/taking-aim-at-belly-fat#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%20makes%20more%20of,and%20blood%20pressure%20to%20rise." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Studies also&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggest visceral fat is more "proinflammatory" than subcutaneous fat, which could potentially contribute to the ill health linked to obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand what might be happening inside fat tissues, Yeger-Lotem and her colleagues charted a "cell atlas" of adipocytes as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/scientists-take-huge-step-forward-in-mapping-all-37-trillion-cells-in-the-human-body"&gt;&lt;u&gt;part of the Human Cell Atlas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a global project that aims to map all the cells in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers built this map using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA seq), which measures which genes are active and to what degree by looking at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular cousin of DNA. RNA molecules act as blueprints for proteins, shuttling instructions from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the cell's nucleus out to its protein-construction sites. By measuring RNA in the nuclei of cells extracted from fat tissue, the team gathered clues as to what each cell does inside the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeger-Lotem and colleagues examined samples of subcutaneous and visceral fat collected from 15 people during elective abdominal surgeries. Most adipocytes were fairly "classical" — meaning storing excess energy was their main purpose. But a small proportion of the fat cells were "non-classical," as their RNA suggested they carried out functions not typically associated with fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these cells were "angiogenic adipocytes," which carried proteins usually used to promote blood vessel formation; "immune-related adipocytes," which make proteins related to immune cell functions; and "extracellular matrix adipocytes," which are related to scaffold proteins that help support cells' structures. These cell subtypes, found in both visceral and subcutaneous fat, were also confirmed under the microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "state-of-the-art application" of snRNA seq suggests these cells may play a role in "remodeling" fat tissues, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" target="_blank" data-url="https://ki.se/en/people/niklas-mejhert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Niklas Mejhert&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of endocrinology at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. Remodeling here refers to the way fat tissues change in response to weight fluctuations or metabolic changes. "Healthy" remodeling would help maintain metabolic balance, but if dysregulated, it could spur inflammation and other drivers of poor health in obesity, Mejhert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/diabetes/in-a-1st-scientists-reversed-type-1-diabetes-by-reprogramming-a-persons-own-fat-cells"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a 1st, scientists reversed type 1 diabetes by reprogramming a person's own fat cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also spotted differences in the newly described cell types depending on which tissue they were taken from. Unconventional adipocytes from visceral fat seemed more likely to communicate with the immune system than those found in skin fat, Yeger-Lotem said. This link to immune cells suggests the cell subtypes might play a role in triggering visceral fat's proinflammatory nature, which could help explain why belly fat is worse for health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also hinted that the fat-tissue donors with higher insulin resistance tended to have a higher concentration of these unconventional cells in visceral fat than did people with lower insulin resistance. However, Mejhert noted that the authors did not prove causation, so it's not clear whether the cells might drive the insulin resistance in any way. It's too early to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these fat subtypes can be linked to human disease, understanding how they work could "help us fight inflammatory processes," Yeger-Lotem said. That could potentially help doctors predict the risk of insulin resistance in people with obesity, assuming all the dots connect, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berry cautioned that the study used a relatively small sample size and that, at this stage, it only suggests rather than definitively demonstrates that the fat cells have these unusual functions. Still, "these insights highlight the importance of understanding fat depots' unique behaviors to develop targeted treatments for obesity and related diseases," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK-Xrzuf1t0zNwaOIGEBWWT32npniqADavl" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-imcaMAhZZBS8atQcABJDhK-Xrzuf1t0zNwaOIGEBWWT32npniqADavl slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Participants who received psilocybin demonstrated substantial improvements in emotional empathy compared to the control group, which received a placebo. These improvements lasted for at least two weeks after treatment. The paper was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-024-02875-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It can be categorized into two types: cognitive empathy (understanding another person’s perspective) and emotional empathy (feeling what others feel). While empathy is essential for forming emotional connections, research suggests that excessive empathy—particularly emotional empathy—can contribute to emotional distress, especially in individuals who frequently absorb others’ negative emotions. As a result, heightened emotional empathy has been linked to an increased risk of depression and burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research suggests that psilocybin can temporarily enhance empathy, particularly emotional empathy, by increasing feelings of connectedness and reducing ego-related barriers. Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms (commonly referred to as “magic mushrooms”) and is known for its hallucinogenic effects. It interacts with serotonin receptors in the brain, leading to altered perception, mood, and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Johannes Jungwirth and his colleagues aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of psilocybin on the empathy levels of depressed individuals and compare these changes to those observed in a placebo group. They assessed empathy differences at two days, eight days, and thirteen days after treatment. Their hypothesis was that psilocybin would increase emotional empathy and that this effect would persist for up to two weeks post-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 51 individuals experiencing an acute depressive episode, 19 of whom were men. The participants’ average age was between 36 and 37 years. Those taking psychiatric medication were required to undergo a washout period before the study began. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either psilocybin (25 participants) or a placebo (an identical-looking, inactive medication; 26 participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved seven in-person visits to the research lab over a four-week period. The first visit consisted of screening. Participants then attended two psychological preparation sessions—one four days before treatment and another one day before treatment. On the third visit, participants received either a single oral dose of psilocybin or a placebo. This was followed by three additional visits at two, eight, and fourteen days after treatment. During these follow-ups, participants attended psychological support sessions designed to help them process difficult emotions and develop a narrative about their experience. At these sessions, they also completed assessments of empathy (using the Multifaceted Empathy Test) and depression (using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that psilocybin treatment led to an improvement in emotional empathy compared to the control (placebo) group. This improvement was evident as early as two days after treatment, peaked at eight days, and was moderate in magnitude. However, no significant differences were found between the two groups regarding cognitive empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the eight-day and fourteen-day follow-ups, individuals in the placebo group who experienced a stronger increase in emotional empathy also tended to show greater improvements in depressive symptoms. However, this association was not observed in the psilocybin group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings provide evidence for the lasting effects of psilocybin on empathy in depressed patients, with significant increases in explicit emotional empathy observed up to 14 days after treatment. Given that conventional antidepressants have been observed to reduce empathy, psilocybin could be a promising candidate for enhancing social cognition and strengthening therapeutic alliance,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study contributes to the scientific understanding of psilocybin’s effects on depressed individuals.

&lt;p&gt;A blind Canadian man could soon see again thanks to a surprising source: his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes, you read that right. Earlier this week, Brent Chapman underwent one of Canada’s first-ever “tooth in eye” surgeries. While it might sound like something straight out of science fiction, this jaw-dropping procedure has been restoring sight in other parts of the world for decades.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a rare operation that most people have not heard of, even if you are an eye surgeon,” &lt;a href="https://drgregmoloneyvancouver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney&lt;/a&gt;, an ophthalmologist and surgeon at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital in Vancouver, &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/tooth-in-eye-surgery-canada-1.7470626" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The procedure, called osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, has been used in other parts of the world for decades.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;H_Ko – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors performed Canada’s first tooth in eye surgeries this week.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cheeky science &lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure, called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;osteo-odonto keratoprosthesis&lt;/a&gt; (OOKP), uses a patient’s own tooth to craft a support structure for an artificial cornea. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The operation is broken down into two parts. First, Moloney and his team removed one of Chapman’s teeth, shaved it down into a rectangle, drilled a hole and popped a plastic optical lens inside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tooth then got a temporary home in his cheek, where it will stay for about three months.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“(The tooth) doesn’t have any connective tissue that I can actually pass a suture through to connect it to the eyeball,” &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/vancouver/article/victoria-woman-becomes-1st-canadian-to-receive-rare-tooth-in-eye-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney told CTV News&lt;/a&gt;. “So the point of implanting it for three months is for it to gain the layer of supporting tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;During the same procedure, Moloney prepared the eye by removing the top layer of the eye’s surface and replacing it with a soft tissue graft from inside Chapman’s cheek. This graft needs a few months to heal so it can support the implant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney said the initial procedure went smoothly, and Chapman will be monitored closely over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it’s time for the second surgery, Chapman’s tooth will be removed from his cheek and placed into his eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney and his team will pull back the graft, remove the damaged iris and lens, and sew the tooth (with its new optical lens) into the eye. The graft will then be resewn over the eye, leaving a small hole for the lens to peek through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The end result is a pink eye with a small black circle through which Chapman will hopefully be able to finally see again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eyes on the prize &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A tooth might seem like an unlikely candidate for eye surgery, but it’s actually the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“(Teeth) contains dentin, which is the ideal tissue to house a plastic lens without the body rejecting it,” &lt;a href="https://thedailyscan.providencehealthcare.org/2025/02/canadas-first-tooth-in-eye-surgeries-aim-to-restore-bc-patients-sight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Moloney explained to The Daily Scan&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, the tissue from the cheek recognizes the tooth, making the whole process smoother. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Surgeons typically use a canine tooth for the surgery.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But don’t get too excited just yet — this procedure isn’t risk-free. “With any ocular surgery of any kind, there’s a chance that we could introduce infection and lose all our vision,” Moloney told CBC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also not meant for everyone. The surgery is often a last-ditch option for people with corneal blindness in the front of the eyes caused by conjunctival scarring from autoimmune diseases, chemical burns and other traumas, but who still have healthy retina and optic nerves. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the risks, the procedure has been restoring sight for several decades in at least 10 countries with a high success rate. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35618023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 study out of Italy&lt;/a&gt; found that, 27 years post-surgery, 94% of patients still had vision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moloney himself has done seven successful tooth in eye surgeries in Australia before bringing his talents to Canada. “The risk-reward ratio for these patients, when they have no vision at all, is well worth it, we think,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Greg Moloney has successfully performed the operation seven times.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Facebook/St. Paul's Foundation/Providence Health Care&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A life-changing gamble &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman has undergone 50 surgeries over the past 20 years, all aimed at restoring his sight, and he hopes this is his last one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old massage therapist from North Vancouver is blind in both eyes due to Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a rare autoimmune reaction triggered by a dose of ibuprofen he took after a basketball game when he was just 13.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Though some of the surgeries he had gave him temporary partial sight, it always faded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When I get it back, you know, it would be sort of this great rush,” he told CBC. “Then I’d lose it again and it would be heartbreaking, and I sort of sank into this depression.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;

		
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time, Chapman hopes things will be different. When his doctor first pitched the tooth in eye surgery, he was hesitant. But after speaking with an Australian woman who had undergone the same procedure to tremendous success, he was sold. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She had been completely blind for 20 years, and is now snow skiing,” he said. Today, Chapman is dreaming about shooting hoops again and traveling the world. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chapman is one of six patients in a pilot program at Mount Saint Joseph Hospital. If the surgeries go well, Moloney and his team plan to pitch Health Canada for funding to open the country’s first OOKP clinic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we’re successful in getting this up and running and stabilized in Vancouver, then we will be the only active North American center for the operation,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

I tried to stave off the inevitable by submerging myself in ice baths and drinking a brand of coffee that claimed to improve cognition. I paid too much for eye creams (to erase dark circles) and hair volumizers (to make my mane look fuller). I whitewashed my résumé, eliminating the year I graduated from college.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6MK5ET53IZDBDNEASI5YMLRIHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I thought I needed to hide my age because of the ageism surrounding me: advertisements that depicted people my age as decrepit and frail, birthday cards that mocked us as deaf or daffy, and other media that simply erased us. For sure, I was not going gently into that good night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U65RTG35TFFN7AOVJ45D4OWQWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It took me several more years to understand that there are different ways to understand ageism, including what researchers call “internalized ageism,” or discriminating against ourselves — and our contemporaries — as we age. Or as Todd D. Nelson, a professor of psychology at California State University at Stanislaus, who edited the book “Ageism,” put it: “&lt;a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00402.x?casa_token=Ki9-NmUKaHgAAAAA%3ARDOX-t29125hQrR2P5ZYcPhkHGPnOCIAbsXxjtoh_NqwhlEi8CdOdQQTSmZQMwle8QuyJ2r7GR53" target="_blank"&gt;prejudice against our feared future self&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C27WBUPA5NFBJE5QF2SDABB65E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Sure, those of us 55-plus face negative stereotypes, bias and discrimination — in health care (exclusion from clinical trials because of age), on the job (being passed over for promotion) and by the media (all those “look younger” ads). But I finally realized that the antiaging messages I was hearing weren’t just coming from others. The awareness set me on a path to reverse my own aging biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QKM6M65MZAJ3OAL4SCCKH7ZIY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Negative &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07317115.2024.2355539#d1e223" target="_blank"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; with getting older have their own &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9757993/" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, according to research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="525DQQCQBBFURN3CEAGJT6VEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LjiIqQDNPQ" target="_blank"&gt;Becca Levy&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychology at Yale University and a leading researcher on the psychology of aging, has written that internalized ageism may take as much as 7.5 years off your life — about the same as heavy smoking. Levy argues in her book, “Breaking the Age Code: How Your Beliefs About Aging Determine How Long and Well You Live,” that those under 60 who hold negative aging stereotypes (frailty, cognitive decline) are more likely to have a heart attack or develop other cardiovascular conditions after they turn 60 than those who make positive associations with getting older (wisdom, loyalty, reliability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7IKKE4BZPNEI7DHTXUW4UM744Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The way we think about aging affects how we age,” Levy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWTQWKBSEBFQ7P3PZIXPEVDUYQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These negative associations get baked into our culture and our memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DZ3F3AH6QRGCTJPVXZIBUFTRA4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But it doesn’t have to be that way. Yes, we can change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="DFL3CCX6PJGTJAXL642LHEL7GA" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="DFL3CCX6PJGTJAXL642LHEL7GA"&gt;Embracing the positives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DARHBFTOIZGNROXI7JTIEOR2QM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For my reset, I first turned to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/06/02/middle-age-midlife-transformation-retirementchrysalis/" target="_blank"&gt;Chip Conley&lt;/a&gt;, the author of “Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder.” Conley is also the founder of the &lt;a href="https://www.meawisdom.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Modern Elder Academy&lt;/a&gt; (MEA), a retreat center designed to help those in midlife navigate its challenges, whether they stem from retirement, empty nest syndrome, divorce or aging. I joined one of his retreats in 2022, on the cusp of turning 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7VGHTSDVBHK5AXZBYH2DGPPHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the MEA, I spent a week with 19 other individuals, hearing admissions such as, “It’s too late for me to learn new things,” or “I’m past the age where I can reinvent myself.” Conley warned us of the dangers of a “closed mindset,” or becoming rigid, fearing change and even believing it’s just too late for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RFHYOGITK5F7VNBBLNTCEH7RO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In an exercise called the Great Midlife Edit, we wrote down our associations with getting older on bits of paper. (You already know mine, which were very similar to the others’.) We then tossed these scraps — representing our old mindsets — into a bonfire, watching them incinerate. “We’re letting go,” a new friend said excitedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B4BAHWFEGBCHDBXN75WJSANZBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;On the second day, Conley asked us to describe what he called “a replacement mindset” — a list of the positives of aging. There are plenty, including greater experience and wisdom, less judgment of others and more acceptance of ourselves, even increased contentment or equilibrium. I understood what Conley was saying, but it was going to take time for me to fully grasp the import of his message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="MGYEBRBBPJBFTPL4LSXNLSH7SQ"&gt;Putting beliefs into practice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K7I6XJO545FSJOG2GETW4FHUR4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the MEA, I began to think about intention and practice. Levy has outlined a three-stage process of bolstering positive age beliefs. The first is increasing awareness: “We know from our research that we often [hold] age beliefs without awareness and they can operate unconsciously.” She noted that children as young as 3 often internalize the age beliefs of the culture around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWBCGCDF2REC7PTSDXZYQ75APY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To combat this, Levy recommends journaling, “which involves writing down all the age beliefs you encounter over one week.” Was the portrayal positive or negative? Or were older people absent from a movie or a show, “because we know that lack of representation … can lead to them becoming marginalized as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OYFHY4IRD5GMXG4OOJAVE6KLFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her second exercise is to ask yourself: “Is what is said about older people ageist?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5SFWCTIMMFB2XD56FJJAAO5A6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ageism is considered one of the last acceptable forms of discrimination and can be challenging to call out. When you’re not sure if you’re seeing bias, Levy suggests changing the target to another marginalized group, such as women: “If an employee states the need to fire older workers, ask yourself how it would sound if the same comments were made about firing women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QN3VORSGH5F45BKQ7HD7PFCFEE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Finally, she recommends an exercise to dismantle negative age beliefs “by countering them with accurate information.” Consider the belief that cognition inevitably declines as we get older. “In fact, a number of types of cognition have been found to improve later in life, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6697608/" target="_blank"&gt;metacognition&lt;/a&gt;, or thinking about thinking,” Levy told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XCLFIPEUQRFYBONLROGVTNTRXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Using her framework, I made a handful of pledges about how to reframe aging. Recently, I pointed out to a gift shop manager that the store sold only birthday cards that mocked older people. The manager, roughly my age, first took umbrage and then got my point, promising to order a different line. Similarly, when people tell me, “You look good for your age,” I nicely explain that that’s damning praise and ageist, because it implies most people my age look awful.

&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., appears to be gearing up for potentially substantial changes in vaccine policies, specifically with respect to the federal government’s messaging and the composition of the advisory panel responsible for making recommendations on vaccination schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy is planning to remove several members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices due to what he &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/20/kennedy-prepares-shakeup-of-vaccine-advisers-00205223" aria-label="views as conflicts of interest"&gt;views as conflicts of interest&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP advises the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on which vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used; for example, recommending which groups of people ought to be vaccinated, at what doses and when. ACIP’s guidance is not binding, though CDC almost always follows it and provides recommendations to the public on what is to be included in the United States adult and childhood &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-schedules/index.html" aria-label="immunization schedules"&gt;immunization schedules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Secretary of HHS can hire or replace ACIP committee members, which may lead to new sets of CDC recommendations. ACIP’s first scheduled meeting since Trump was inaugurated &lt;a href="https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04" aria-label="was postponed"&gt;&lt;u data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://marketing.statnews.com/e3t/Ctc/LV+113/cp47z04/VWHzhx2tcM65W3Rs6t679YsGKW3pvQRf5sj6MfN7PgQ2K3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3pHW4lq1C98-q7xLVWxTRP6RbfczW5gd9B26tJCh9VNX2jx6_Hs7QW3jpRx_5DvXyvVBf4NX65br8sW5Q47C85WvWRwW65r-sk4yYGnRW1kYWwc95WN0lW5kZZs-93v1CwW3jqPYf473BV_W2c235R5llH3TW8w8vCG5K51s1W8SCpcx7DQBM1V1hFmK4flvz7W7zjX_K4SztwkW2YB_1q4y1G9xN2y5NzW-95Q9W110b6X98GSY3W79bg7Q7Vvz2HW4vxmZB67Yt_jW34hz245pmpDFW2vYY0x3pBbyhV7zgMS6ZN4tNW8Xtnwk31FMN6W71cfHL70wt4lW3j9fbn6YCdhnW8kwZXR8pL3--f6kXwpz04"&gt;was postponed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week It’s not clear at this time exactly what this postponement signals, though in light of other changes within HHS it may be a foreboding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the CDC has been &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/20/cdc-vaccine-promotions-rfk-jr-informed-consent/?utm_campaign=breaking_news&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9QY5bF2eXGzMFtvAcGepnks3M-3u3nlXku1jNkUleQKJHYQ5w5r6YNt8L4dVyIMNKnR9Xlv6uqMgtcl3DCbbleW1EuKU8dCWjIohWNb553G1U7uRk&amp;amp;_hsmi=348281919&amp;amp;utm_content=348281919&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" aria-label="ordered"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; to shelve promotions it developed for multiple vaccines, including a “Wild to Mild” advertising campaign urging people to get vaccinated against influenza. Secretary of HHS Kennedy says he wants advertisements that incorporate a more robust version of “informed consent.” Informed consent is the principle that people should be notified of all the risks, as well as benefits, of any medical intervention they receive or any therapeutic they are prescribed. The Wild to Mild ads emphasizes the harm-reducing functions of vaccines, particularly for vulnerable populations like pregnant women, young children and the immunocompromised. Evidently, Kennedy wants messages that are more focused on potential adverse events associated with vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just this week the FDA canceled a meeting of its flu vaccine advisors. The panel was set to convene to discuss the composition of the 2025-2026 influenza vaccine.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/rfk-jr-vow-purge-fda-sets-up-collision-with-big-pharma-2024-11-15/" aria-label="has previously said"&gt;has previously said &lt;/a&gt;that he is concerned about the pharmaceutical industry’s close relationship with government agencies and the entities such as ACIP that advise them. But it’s unclear what Kennedy means when current ACIP members include several academics, a chief medical officer of a community health center, a state public health higher-up and the owner of a family medicine practice. (We reached out to Kennedy’s office for comment, but did not receive a reply)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes at HHS are taking place against the backdrop of a large &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2025/02/18/widening-measles-outbreak-in-texas-signals-problem-with-vaccine-uptake/" target="_self" aria-label="measles outbreak"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; which began in West Texas and thus far has claimed the life of a child and hospitalized 19 others. Practically all the people who’ve contracted measles are unvaccinated. Yet Kennedy seems to be &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.msn.com/en-us/public-safety-and-emergencies/health-and-safety-alerts/rfk-jr-said-measles-outbreaks-are-not-unusual-in-the-us-doctors-say-he-s-wrong/ar-AA1zWcKY?ocid=BingNewsSerp" aria-label="downplaying"&gt;downplaying&lt;/a&gt; the situation in Texas and New Mexico, suggesting that such outbreaks are not unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s vaccine-skeptic views are well-known. And while he &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://lexfridman.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-transcript/" aria-label="told"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the podcaster Lex Fridman in 2023 that some vaccines “are probably averting more problems than they’re causing,” he also maintained that “there’s no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective.” Kennedy recently informed employees within his department that he &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/healthpolicy/114262" aria-label="vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule"&gt;vows to investigate the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt; that prevents measles, polio and other infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of this doesn’t come as a surprise. Kennedy has invariably been outspoken on vaccines and what he sees as public health agencies’ “suppression” of controversial treatments. Just prior to the November election, Kennedy &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737" aria-label="posted"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; on X, warning the FDA that its “aggressive suppression of psychedelics, peptides, stem cells, raw milk, hyperbaric therapies, chelating compounds, ivermectin, [and] hydroxychloroquine” was about to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drugs ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2021/08/29/ivermectin-a-40-year-old-anti-parasitic-now-embedded-in-a-covid-19-culture-war/" target="_self" aria-label="embroiled in a culture war"&gt;embroiled in a culture war&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic that pitted unproven treatments against proven measures, such as vaccines. Kennedy defends himself as merely wanting placebo-controlled trials prior to licensure and no vaccine mandates. However, the vaccines he rails against are typically subject to such clinical trials. Furthermore, arguably the mandates Kennedy opposes, which have been in place since the 1960s, have helped to contribute to a dramatic decline in childhood infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From smallpox inoculations—which began in the late 18th century and ended when the disease was eradicated in the 1970s—to mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and measles immunizations, vaccinations have saved millions of lives and prevented crippling and life-threatening illnesses from occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, mass vaccination programs with single or combination—measles, mumps and rubella—shots began in the 1960s and quickly suppressed the spread of measles in most developed countries. The measles vaccine is “&lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595357/" aria-label="sterilizing"&gt;sterilizing&lt;/a&gt;,” which means it not only prevents illness, but also transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither the Secretary of HHS nor the CDC director can unilaterally ban vaccines. But they can alter the CDC’s messaging, hire and fire ACIP committee members and revise vaccine scheduling. The fact that the HHS secretary and probable CDC director, nominee Dave Weldon, have aligned views could facilitate the process of transforming vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1973/text" aria-label="bill"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; which Weldon sponsored sought to undo what he saw as a conflict of interest entailed by CDC being both a promoter of vaccines and an evaluator of their safety. This echoes Kennedy’s opinion on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should Weldon be confirmed, he will be making the decisions regarding whether a vaccine should be recommended to the public.

meant to be given to children in a series of two shots at 12 to 15 months old as well as between the ages of four and six years old – through its immunization program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Earlier, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) upheld the role of vaccines in offering protection against measles after an unvaccinated child died from an infection this week. The death, reported on Wednesday, was the first US fatality from the highly contagious disease in a decade. Government data shows a growing outbreak with more than 140 cases reported in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; since late January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The child’s death and the hospitalization of nearly 20 other patients in Texas have put Kennedy’s vaccine views to the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy founded the Children’s Health Defense anti-vaccine group. However, he has claimed he is not “anti-vaccine” and has said he would not prevent Americans from getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;A total of 164 measles cases were reported as of 27 February across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas, information from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; showed. About 95% of those infected were unvaccinated people, including children whose parents did not follow CDC recommendations to get them immunized with safe, effective vaccines providing protection against measles as well as other easily preventable diseases. Another 3% were from people who received only one of the two required shots for immunity, CDC data showed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;These cases were reported in nine jurisdictions, including Kentucky, marking a near 80% jump from 93 cases reported a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Also on Friday, Kennedy’s health and human services department announced plans to eliminate public participation in many of the agency’s policy decisions – a proposal that explicitly flouts a promise of “radical transparency” that he previously made to Congress while lawmakers considered confirming his appointment to the cabinet of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The health and human services department has allowed such public comment on a range of agency actions for decades. It would mark a noted shift in the rulemaking process at the agency, which directs $3tn in healthcare spending and oversees the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid – which insure more than 140 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters contributed reporting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 14:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQcmJpTjdaUXp4UFNIeXNOdmZMZk04MFNZczNUQS01dmJyWVdkTVBpbndMWTZDZzc4ZWpIaXd3T3hodEx5LTVWV2RNZ0FFbXdjWVQwdmdBaFJmb21Kc0dRdDlvb2dCRUp5dTR1d3ZHbVNrUTFHc0s1ODl3NU5RTFNZUEotVS1LcE8wVFh1TVR2YTNPbjZaMUVmTQ</guid></item><item><title>10 Thoughtful Food and Drink Gifts for Flu and Cold Recovery - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOUnU1VFd2cDU0ZmQzUW5GWjEtSGhOS19wZnl5a2lUYk5nYkE4VEQyS25yb0Uxd3FaenM5RFk3Vnp3LUl3Y1Y5YzNYMlNwbzdBdnh3RV9pY3o4emlWYTJpRWRIRnF2NnpGLVNrTXp6cUJhVE14VHcwVXRZT2MyNHh6Zk4tNERXYk5Ta2RNLWlaMWE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another great choice to send is bone broth, which provides nutrients and soothes a sore throat.

Unlike the Western model of learning one language from a primary caregiver, these children acquire language through a dynamic social environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local languages like Akan, Ga, and Ewe are learned mainly through direct interactions, while English is acquired more indirectly via media and official communication. These findings highlight the need for a broader perspective on language acquisition that reflects global linguistic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multilingual Exposure:&lt;/strong&gt; Ghanaian infants hear two to six languages from multiple caregivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direct vs. Indirect Input:&lt;/strong&gt; Local languages come from direct interactions, while English is learned mainly through media.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redefining Language Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The study challenges Western assumptions about single-language learning models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Potsdam&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study that examined 121 babies aged three to twelve months in Accra, the capital of Ghana, demonstrates a remarkable variety of language input in the early months of life. The children are regularly exposed to two to six languages.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strikingly, the number of caregivers the children have also ranges between two and six, and babies who have more adults in their daily lives who regularly take care of them also hear more different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ghana, families often live in so-called “compound buildings”, where many everyday interactions take place in the courtyard, where family, neighbors and other relatives play an important role in the lives of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that a child learns only one particular language from a single caregiver, as is often assumed in Western cultures, does not apply to these communities. Rather, children are surrounded by a rich spectrum of linguistic inputs from the very beginning,” says Paul O. Omane, the first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The majority of studies on children’s language acquisition have been conducted in Western industrialized nations, which is why they often focus on a rather narrow conception of multilingualism. Our research shows that other societies show a much more vibrant multilingual environment,” the study’s lead researcher, Prof. Dr. Natalie Boll-Avetisyan adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding of the study is the distinction between direct and indirect language input. While English is primarily acquired through indirect channels such as television and official communication, children receive most of the local languages (such as Akan, Ga and Ewe) through direct contact with their caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the proportion of direct input is higher in the local languages than in English, which is predominantly present as indirect input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often emphasized how important direct language contact is for language acquisition,” Natalie Boll-Avetisyan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, our results suggest that indirect input – especially through media and official communication – also plays an essential role in the children’s daily lives, particularly in urban contexts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of their empirical study, the researchers call for a broader view in language research. The common assumptions do not reflect the diversity and complexity found in other cultural contexts such as Ghana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study makes it clear that it is not only the number of languages a child hears, but also the diversity of people and the different forms of input that have a decisive influence on language acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that for many children, a multilingual environment is a dynamic, vibrant reality from the very beginning. Multilingualism is not just a bonus, but a fundamental part of children’s identity and social structure,” the researcher says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and learning research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c6aba7b2b2aeafa7b5e8bcafababa3b4aba7a8a886b3a8afebb6a9b2b5a2a7abe8a2a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matthias Zimmermann&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uni-potsdam.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Potsdam&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matthias Zimmermann – University of Potsdam&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cogdev.2025.101558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploring the nature of multilingual input to infants in multiple caregiver families in an African city: The case of Accra (Ghana)&lt;/a&gt;” by Natalie Boll-Avetisyan et al. &lt;em&gt;Cognitive Development&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the nature of multilingual input to infants in multiple caregiver families in an African city: The case of Accra (Ghana)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining the language input experiences of infants growing up in multilingual African environments is essential to understanding their language acquisition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We explored the language input to 3;0–12;0-month-old infants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 121) in Ghana (Sub-Saharan Africa), a non-Western and less-economically rich social context and highly multilingual country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Data collection involved an interview assessment, followed by caregivers completing a 12-hour logbook to indicate the languages their child heard over a day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results demonstrated consistency of the infant’s language exposure across both input measurement tools, suggesting their reliability. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Results revealed that Ghanaian infants are raised multilingually, exposed to between two and six languages, and engage with between two and six regular input providers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was no evidence for associations of age with number of languages or regular input providers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Analyses of the relative amount of input in Ghanaian English, Akan, Ewe, and Ga, revealed that infants receive less direct than indirect input in Ghanaian English, with no such difference observed in Akan, Ewe, Ga, and no evidence of age effects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These findings shed light on the language environment and input to African infants raised in multilingual societies, highlighting the impact of social and cultural contexts on linguistic input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conclude with reflections on studying infants in non-Western, less-economically Rich social contexts in multilingual Africa.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 13:34:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOT092eExyNVp5cDJncGNIZTNrZ24tWmZQLThnbG5wbnZvaHFCQVkxWFltRWpvbmJaVnZTWmpreXVjOEtmTDFWaDlib0R1c0ZLWG1vVzRhb3NMRDBJWFltZFhpanBxQ21TMHpaVjRReG9oOVprdl9Zbngyc0xXU1kzR1dCRQ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists discovered a new way to prevent cold sores - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQSVJDRXpuaDFBcGJrajNIZHczRmRGNEViYXlpNVYxZ0hMM0xlQU1KcXJEZXQ3b2J2ODRSUGxfeU9JcEs3N3VVc3NsRWtSVzNvM3BBN1pvcHhKcWZnTHhIYlpRR1N5RE94dVY4SDlrNnFfSE9yV1Z5b3ZRaUh3X0pXdFNyektpTml6bHZZMlpEZGNzWDgtcHdN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have uncovered a surprising strategy used by the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) to reawaken in the body. A new study from the &lt;a href="https://med.virginia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Virginia School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; has identified a viral protein, UL12.5, that plays a key role in triggering viral reactivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery challenges conventional understanding of how the virus escapes dormancy and could lead to new treatments for both cold sores and genital herpes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_herpes_virus_a_persistent_pathogen"&gt;The Herpes Virus: A Persistent Pathogen&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 is a highly contagious virus that infects over 60% of people under 50 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Once inside the body, the virus establishes a lifelong presence, lying dormant in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/human-touch-stimulates-16-different-types-of-nerve-cells-in-the-body/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nerve cells&lt;/a&gt; until reactivated by stress, illness, or even sun exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While typically associated with cold sores, HSV-1 can also cause genital herpes, encephalitis, and has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Researchers Sean R.

These receptors activate pathways designed to eliminate the infection. However, viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade or manipulate these defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particularly surprising discovery is that HSV-1 does not merely wait for favorable conditions to reactivate—it actively participates in its own reawakening by triggering an &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/red-meat-improves-immune-response-to-cancer-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="the_role_of_ul12_5_in_viral_reactivation"&gt;The Role of UL12.5 in Viral Reactivation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at UVA, led by Anna Cliffe, Ph.D., found that HSV-1 expresses the protein UL12.5, which stimulates the immune system in a way that paradoxically aids viral reactivation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;UL12.5 targets mitochondria, the cell’s energy-producing structures, causing them to release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. This triggers the cGAS-STING pathway, a major immune response mechanism that typically fights infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal circumstances, cGAS detects foreign DNA in the cytosol and activates STING, which initiates the production of interferons and other &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/bioluminescent-lanterns-shed-new-light-on-memory-formation-and-synaptic-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antiviral molecules&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, HSV-1 exploits this pathway to reawaken from dormancy. By inducing mitochondrial stress and the release of mtDNA, UL12.5 sets off a chain reaction that promotes viral gene expression and reactivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that HSV-1 doesn’t just passively wait for the right conditions to reactivate – it actively senses danger and takes control of the process,” said researcher Patryk Krakowiak. “Our findings suggest that the virus may be using immune signals as a way to detect cellular stress—whether from neuron damage, infections, or other threats—as a cue to escape its host and find a new one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Representative immunofluorescence images of STING/pIRF3 at 3-days post transduction with either GFP or UL12.5 expressing lentiviral vector.

Current antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, only suppress viral replication during active infection but cannot prevent reactivation. The discovery of UL12.5’s role in awakening the virus suggests that targeting this protein could prevent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are now following up on this work to investigate how the virus is hijacking this response and testing inhibitors of UL12.5 function,” Cliffe said. “Currently, there are no therapies that can prevent the virus from waking up from dormancy, and this stage was thought to only use &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-create-advanced-sense-and-respond-systems-that-mimic-natural-cellular-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;host proteins&lt;/a&gt;. Developing therapies that specifically act on a viral protein is an attractive approach that will likely have fewer side effects than targeting a host protein.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that in cases where another infection was present, HSV-1 did not require UL12.5 for reactivation. Instead, the immune response triggered by the second infection was sufficient to wake up the virus. This suggests that HSV-1 can use multiple pathways to reactivate, further complicating treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic of the in vivo model of HSV-1 latent infection.

Some research suggests that chronic inflammation from repeated HSV-1 reactivation may contribute to diseases such as Alzheimer’s. The ability of HSV-1 to manipulate immune pathways in neurons raises concerns about its long-term effects on brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus establishes latency in neurons, where it remains dormant until certain conditions trigger reactivation. The absence of viral proteins during latency means that HSV-1 relies on host signaling pathways to initiate reactivation. One such pathway involves &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-how-air-pollution-may-trigger-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interleukin-1β&lt;/a&gt; (IL-1β), a key inflammatory cytokine. Previous studies have shown that IL-1β can induce HSV-1 reactivation by increasing neuronal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings identify the first viral protein required for herpes simplex virus to wake up from dormancy, and, surprisingly, this protein does so by triggering responses that should act against the virus,” Cliffe explained. “This is important because it gives us new ways to potentially prevent the virus from waking up and activating immune responses in the nervous system that could have negative consequences in the long term.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic of the in vitro HSV latent infection and reactivation model.

Patel, a pediatric critical-care doctor at Children’s National Hospital in D.C., said this is the worst flu season she has seen in more than a decade.

(Even though experts widely acknowledge that plant-based meat would, in fact, better help feed a growing population, as it &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.00134/full#h16"&gt;requires less land and water&lt;/a&gt; and generates far &lt;a href="/22787178/beyond-impossible-plant-based-vegetarian-meat-climate-environmental-impact-sustainability"&gt;less greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt; than animal meat.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But take a closer look at Elanco, and Simmons’s opposition isn’t all that surprising. The company he runs, which spun off from pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly in 2019, is a world leader in developing and marketing pharmaceuticals — including antibiotics and vaccines — for both pets and livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates"&gt;nearly all&lt;/a&gt; meat, milk, and eggs come from factory farms, which are prone to being overcrowded, stressful, disease-ridden environments where animals are especially susceptible to infections. Products from companies like Elanco are integral to preventing and treating those inevitable infections, serving an essential role in industrial animal agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf3 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div id=":R32rarr6:" class="duet--article--image-gallery-two-up _1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx5"&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwx8 _1j8uwx7"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Pigs at a factory farm in North Carolina.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Callaghan O’Hare/Bloomberg&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1j8uwxa _1j8uwx9"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Turkeys at a factory farm in Michigan.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Rudy Malmquist&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If plant-based meat were ever to displace some of the conventional meat supply, it would mean fewer factory-farmed animals, and thus less profit for Elanco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Alternatives to animal-derived protein,” among other things, the company &lt;a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001739104/db9c37f7-e0c2-43f9-95a5-17edac7e6524.pdf"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a 2019 financial report, “could negatively affect the market for our products.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91193489/a-climate-solution-is-here-and-it-has-four-stomachs"&gt;the press&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eat-burger-climate-guilt-unpacked-jeff-simmons/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, Simmons has also exaggerated the potential of technology to slash livestock emissions. In 2021, he claimed — without citing evidence — that some cattle operations could reach net zero emissions within a decade, and that we shouldn’t expend energy on changing people’s diets to fight climate change. That flies in the face of &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline"&gt;consensus&lt;/a&gt; from climate scientists and agriculture experts, who, in a 2021 survey, overwhelmingly agreed that rich- and middle-income countries need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, which currently account for about &lt;a href="/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf"&gt;15 to 20 percent of global emissions&lt;/a&gt;, and that slashing meat and dairy consumption is the most effective way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;On conference stages, Simmons has criticized Bill Gates’s bullish support for meat alternatives and a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jun/23/chipotle-ad-wins-tv-cannes"&gt;Chipotle marketing campaign&lt;/a&gt; critical of factory farming, while another Elanco executive criticized raising animal welfare standards for chickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Elanco declined an interview request for this story and didn’t respond to a list of detailed questions. “For 70 years, Elanco has pioneered ways to improve animal health and wellbeing and raise livestock more sustainably,” the company wrote in a statement to Vox. “We work alongside farmers and veterinarians to bring forward leading innovations in nutrition and diet management, digestion optimization as well as on-farm sustainability solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The company’s work can be thought of as part of the “&lt;a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/society-politics-law/why-are-nonhuman-animals-victims-harm/content-section-3"&gt;animal-industrial complex&lt;/a&gt;” — a network of companies, governments, and public and private research centers that, according to sociologist &lt;a href="https://www.richardtwine.com/"&gt;Richard Twine&lt;/a&gt; at Edge Hill University in the UK, make up the factory farm system, promote its continued existence and expansion, and defend it from criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Jeff Simmons, president and CEO of Elanco Animal Health Inc., center, applauds while ringing the opening bell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2018.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“There’s a lot of effort being put into protecting business as usual,” Twine said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That animal-industrial complex encompasses meat, milk, and egg companies and their trade associations, pharmaceutical companies like Elanco, genetics companies that &lt;a href="/xpress/2014/10/2/6875031/chickens-breeding-farming-boilers-giant"&gt;breed farm animals to grow bigger and faster&lt;/a&gt;, and the seed, fertilizer, and farm equipment companies involved in growing animal feed. It also includes public institutions, such as industry-friendly agencies like the &lt;a href="/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing"&gt;US Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="/future-perfect/357195/land-grant-universities-greenwashing-climate-methane-factory-farming"&gt;land-grant universities&lt;/a&gt; that receive funding from and partner with the meat industry on its research priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The entities within this ecosystem work to boost meat production and sales, shape public policy, and amplify messaging that improves consumer perception of animal products.

Merck Animal Health — a division of Merck, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies — and Zoetis, which in 2013 spun off from the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, engage in some of the same activities, like sponsoring meat industry conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Zoetis didn’t respond to a request for comment and Merck Animal Health declined an interview request. The Animal Health Institute, a trade group that represents the animal pharmaceutical industry, didn’t respond to a list of detailed questions about the industry and pointed me to progress reports from the intergovernmental &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2024/10/towards-a-healthier-future-for-all-amr-progress-report-en.pdf"&gt;World Organization for Animal Health&lt;/a&gt; and the trade group &lt;a href="https://healthforanimals.org/healthforanimals.org/roadmap/"&gt;HealthforAnimals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the last century, these companies’ innovations in developing infection-fighting antimicrobial drugs for livestock were critical to building the factory farm system as we know it today. That system helped make meat, milk, and eggs more affordable and abundant, and lower their per-pound carbon footprint. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But it also has contributed to serious &lt;a href="/future-perfect/363550/factory-farming-human-progress-sustainable-food-movement"&gt;animal welfare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf"&gt;environmental&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; concerns, including &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda"&gt;antimicrobial-resistant germs&lt;/a&gt; or “superbugs,” which adapt and build resilience against the antibiotics laced in farmed animals’ feed and water. When these germs escape the farm and infect humans, antibiotics are ineffective at treating them, which can make common ailments difficult or even impossible to heal. Heavy antibiotic use in livestock, along with overuse of antibiotics in humans, is a significant driver of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, which &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;killed over one million people worldwide in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and played a role in an additional 4.95 million deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Around 70 percent of antibiotics important in human medicine are fed to farmed animals, both in &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/bio/david-wallinga-md/antibiotic-use-remains-far-too-intensive-us-livestock"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/despite-rising-deaths-bacterial-infection-meat-industry-under-little-pressure-2024-03-12/#:~:text=However%2C%20by%20far%20the%20biggest,animal%20feed%20to%20increase%20growth"&gt;globally&lt;/a&gt;. The World Health Organization has called for &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;significant reductions&lt;/a&gt; and considers &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; “one of the top global public health and development threats.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That crisis can be partly pinned on the pharmaceutical companies that helped to build factory farming, undermining their &lt;a href="https://www.elanco.com/en-us/about-us/our-vision"&gt;stated missions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.zoetis.com/our-company/our-story/about-us"&gt;improving human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.merck-animal-health.com/about-us/"&gt;animal health&lt;/a&gt;. After decades of increasing pressure from consumers, public health experts, and US policymakers, some of these pharma companies have in recent years pledged to move away from antibiotics, but little progress has been made. And through it all, animal pharma companies have remained set on further expanding factory farming in the US and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-big-pharma-helped-build-factory-farming" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How Big Pharma helped build factory farming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the interwar period, the discovery of antibiotics like Prontosil and penicillin led to a pharmaceutical revolution, enabling doctors to quickly heal common bacterial infections in humans that until then had often been life-threatening. The drugs soon became mass-produced and affordable, and more antibiotic discoveries followed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It wasn’t long until pharmaceutical leaders like Pfizer looked for markets beyond human medicine. They found it on the farm, according to &lt;a href="https://people.ucd.ie/claas.kirchhelle"&gt;Claas Kirchhelle&lt;/a&gt;, a medical historian at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research who documents the rise of antibiotics in agriculture in his book &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvscxrvf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pyrrhic Progress: The History of Antibiotics in Anglo-American Food Production&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the late 1940s, researchers came to understand that when farmed animals are fed regular, low doses of certain antibiotics, they gain weight faster on less feed and better stave off disease, Kirchhelle explains in his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This one-two punch of disease prevention and rapid weight gain suddenly made it more feasible to pack large numbers of animals in barns, while having fewer animals die from infectious diseases and shortening the amount of time it took for animals to reach their “market weight.” These became two hallmarks of factory farming, enabling farmers to squeeze more meat out of each animal and increase profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Antibiotic adoption in the meat industry was swift: By 1951, around 16 percent of antibiotics sold in the US went to livestock; by 1970, it reached 43 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixl"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;A veterinarian preparing a vaccine for a dairy cow.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Sutthichai Supapornpasupad&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;America’s precipitous increase in meat production after World War II, facilitated in part by antibiotics, was widely celebrated as a solution to Malthusian fears that humanity wouldn’t be able to feed a rapidly growing global population. “For patriotic US researchers, politicians, and journalists, promulgating agricultural plenty and efficiency-boosting technologies like antibiotics became a moral duty,” Kirchhelle writes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By the 1960s, scientists paid increasing attention to the antimicrobial resistance threat posed by animal agriculture. Strains of bacterial diseases like salmonella and E. coli can adapt and build resistance to those antibiotics and then leave the farm and infect humans in a number of ways: improperly cooked meat, livestock manure leaching into drinking water or rivers and streams, or on the clothes of a farm owner or worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the US Food and Drug Administration, which oversees animal pharmaceuticals, for decades failed to take the issue seriously and downplayed warnings. In the 1970s, the agency did make an earnest attempt to limit the use of two classes of human-critical antibiotics in livestock, but it was thwarted by a burgeoning coalition of livestock and pharmaceutical business interests. According to Kirchhelle, this coalition also funded a separate organization to conduct “counter science” to muddy the scientific debate over the proposed ban, which included organizing experts to write a report that was then edited without the researchers’ consent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It wasn’t until the mid-2010s that the FDA took two basic but important actions to meaningfully address the problem: requiring farmers to get veterinarian prescriptions for medically important antibiotics, and asking — though not requiring — animal pharmaceutical companies to remove language on product labels about antibiotics’ ability to make animals grow faster. Sales of antibiotics soon fell rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It represented progress, but not enough, according to Gail Hansen, an antimicrobial expert and former state public health veterinarian in Kansas. Hansen told me the agency’s actions represented a compromise that was favorable to industry compared to what some high-ranking members of Congress were pushing for at the time: significant antibiotic use restrictions and increased transparency from drug makers on how their antibiotics were used in livestock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pharma companies wanted to change antibiotic use “on their own terms and not the government telling them what to do,” according to Hansen. “If they could show just a little bit of good faith,” by complying with the FDA, they could stave off stricter regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="pharma-and-big-ag-still-cant-quit-antibiotics" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Pharma and Big Ag still can’t quit antibiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the last decade, livestock pharma companies have found themselves at a crossroads. Under growing scrutiny from public health experts and policymakers, the biggest players in the sector have committed to “&lt;a href="https://www.elanco.com/en-us/sustainability/esg-reporting/antimicrobial-stewardship"&gt;antimicrobial stewardship&lt;/a&gt;,” promising to wean farmers off medically important antibiotics by investing in vaccine development, nutritional supplements like enzymes and probiotics, and animal-only antibiotics, which aren’t used in human medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But while the FDA’s actions cut antibiotic use on farms from 2015 to 2017, corporate efforts since then have seemingly failed to move the needle: Sales of medically important antibiotics increased 10 percent from 2017 to 2023, and the US remains far behind Europe, where in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/antimicrobial-stewardship/us-lagging-europe-efforts-cut-antibiotics-livestock"&gt;antibiotic use per animal was about half&lt;/a&gt; that of the US. The continent slashed antibiotic use through tougher regulations, better farm hygiene, and relying more on vaccines, enzymes, probiotics, and other products to prevent disease, according to Leon Marchal, a Netherlands-based innovation director at IFF Health &amp;amp; Bioscience, which develops and sells animal health products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Despite the animal pharmaceutical industry’s stated commitments to antimicrobial stewardship, some of their actions have suggested a reluctance to move away from the drugs. In 2023, the &lt;a href="https://www.elanco.com/ru-ru/sustainability/esg-reporting/antimicrobial-stewardship"&gt;share of Elanco’s revenue&lt;/a&gt; from medically important antibiotics, for both pets and livestock, stood at 10 percent, down just 2 percent from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In 2018, the company ran an advertising campaign designed to assuage consumer concerns over &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/19/animal-antibiotics-calm-down-about-your-chicken-says-big-pharma"&gt;antibiotics in meat production&lt;/a&gt;. And at a major pork industry conference the same year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/health/drug-companies-antibiotics-resistance.html"&gt;Elanco handed out brochures&lt;/a&gt; encouraging farmers to feed pigs a pair of antibiotics to make the animals grow fatter. But a few years earlier, the FDA had told one of Elanco’s subsidiaries that drug combination was unsafe and shouldn’t be promoted to increase weight gain. Elanco committed to stop distributing the brochures &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/health/drug-companies-antibiotics-resistance.html"&gt;after the New York Times inquired&lt;/a&gt; about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“For more than 15 years, we’ve been focused on increasing responsible antibiotic use, reducing the need for antibiotics and improving the health of animals through vaccines, nutrition and other efforts,” Elanco wrote in a statement to Vox. “Most importantly, Elanco has focused on expanding access to animal-only antibiotics, which don’t create a threat to human resistance, and creating antibiotic alternatives, including vaccines, enzymes, probiotic and prebiotics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Around the same time, Zoetis was using similar messaging when &lt;a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2018-10-12/worlds-biggest-animal-drugs-company-sells-antibiotics-to-fatten-livestock-in-india-despite-superbug-risk"&gt;selling human-relevant antibiotics to farmers in India&lt;/a&gt;, where, like in other middle-income countries, poultry factory farming is quickly expanding. The company told the press that it was following India’s antibiotics regulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As the reputational risk of selling medically important antibiotics in the US rises, some of the biggest animal pharmaceutical companies are moving on to what Elanco has called its “next economic opportunity”: mitigating climate change. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-brief/fda-brief-fda-approves-first-animal-drug-reduces-gas-emissions-animal-or-its-waste"&gt;gained FDA approval for a drug&lt;/a&gt; that reduces ammonia emissions in cattle; &lt;a href="https://www.zoetis.com/news-and-insights/featured-stories/zoetis-announces-research-collaboration-to-explore-potential-solutions-to-inhibit-methane-emissions-from-ruminant-livestock?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Zoetis has also announced research efforts&lt;/a&gt; to develop a similar product. Last year, the FDA completed its review of Elanco’s Bovaer product — a powder that when fed to dairy cows daily can reduce emissions from their methane-rich burps — and deemed it safe and effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’re committed to bringing innovative solutions that allow farmers and ranchers to reduce and measure emissions,” the company wrote in a statement to Vox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These products have the potential to reduce some types of cattle-caused emissions, but by much less than we could by simply eating far fewer animal products and more of the plant-based foods that Elanco executives have attacked. But companies that depend on factory farming would prefer we keep engineering animals’ diets for maximum productivity, and now, minimal environmental liability, rather than reach for a veggie burger or glass of soy milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This new class of emission-reducing feed products may come with a sustainable sheen, but they’re in keeping with how the industry views animals — not as living, feeling creatures, but as machines whose diets and environments must be endlessly fine-tuned with chemical inputs to compensate for unhygienic farms, poor animal welfare, and a sizable carbon footprint. Even as policy leaders in wealthy countries begin to wake up to the costs of this system, it continues to grow bigger and more entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This “model of food production,” Kirchhelle said, “is becoming more and more the dominant mode of producing animals worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQcm9WTEszYU1wMS01YkxrLWEtaGpZajY0T0tXU3BoeDI1SDNVMUFCQlA1dUhOTVlYUU5QRTQ3RmVGQ0VYQnlBLXFWWUJKTmxrUDJiVFNNQWhGR2tpWmdYb05oeDdMYVFxT3dlMTl4Skw2dGdzLTc2Nk1xMW1BaG52SkFlTlVBejdxRV91YVFaSkt5NTZ6UTVIVXV3</guid></item><item><title>The #1 Underrated Exercise to Do If You Have Diabetes, According to Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE0ydkVtOFhoMm9WeHdxZ0RSclljbjBmUWdYVnBETTR1NFlfZWJsT1hhcVUxUVNRX2lqSUVhUUgtT0hpbVk5VFNtWllfMWh3TWs2dThxMnVpX2x2Ymx3R3RSazNTQXl1VFlSUEJ2cDU1ZFlBeWFrTW9F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re living with diabetes or prediabetes, your doctor might suggest adding more exercise to your routine to help keep your blood sugar in check. But that advice may leave you overwhelmed and wondering, what’s the best exercise for diabetes? Should I hit the treadmill, sign up for a fitness class or invest in exercise equipment? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The answer might surprise you. Experts agree the best exercise for diabetes is the most underrated. It’s walking! Here’s how walking can help improve your blood sugar, and how much you need to do for better blood sugar management.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-walking-can-improve-your-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Walking Can Improve Your Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improves Insulin Sensitivity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Think of exercise as free medication for blood sugar management. When someone has diabetes, they may be resistant to their body’s own insulin, or their pancreas might not produce enough insulin, says &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, M.S., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a certified diabetes educator and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Because insulin is necessary to transport glucose from the blood into your cells for energy, this can cause sugar to hang out in the bloodstream, resulting in elevated blood sugar readings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How can walking help? “Any type of exercise, like walking, helps the body use its insulin better and can help lower blood sugar levels,” adds Kimberlain. And the benefits don’t stop once you finish your walk. The positive effects of exercise can last up to 24 hours after a workout, she says. So, you still reap the benefits hours later.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Prevents Blood Sugar Spikes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Keeping blood sugar levels stable is key for managing diabetes, and walking can help. “Even taking a short walk after meals, just 10- to 15-minute walk, can help prevent blood sugar spikes,” says &lt;a href="https://www.ashleyhawkrd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashley Hawk, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian. “Research shows that a short walk within 30 minutes of eating can help blunt post-meal blood sugar spikes, which is a game-changer for diabetes management.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Supports Heart Health  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise doesn’t just strengthen your muscles. It also strengthens the heart and improves circulation. This is especially important for people with diabetes, who face a higher risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That’s because consistently high blood sugar levels can damage coronary arteries, making them susceptible to fatty atherosclerotic deposits, leading to coronary artery disease, says &lt;a href="https://www.doximity.com/pub/kunal-lal-md-fcaf4fee" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kunal Lal, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a Florida-based cardiologist.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news? Walking offers major heart-health benefits. It can help lower blood pressure and triglycerides, reduce markers of inflammation and raise beneficial HDL cholesterol. So, every step you take supports your body in a multitude of ways.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-strategies-to-incorporate-walking-into-your-routine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Strategies to Incorporate Walking into Your Routine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Make It a Regular Habit &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consistency is key when it comes to adding walking to your routine. While you don’t have to walk every day, experts recommend a total of 150 minutes of moderate- intensity activity per week. You can break it down in various ways. If you enjoy hitting the pavement most days, break that up into 30 minutes five times a week. If a daily walk is more your jam, aim for about 25 minutes per day. Or, if you prefer longer stretches, shoot for 75 minutes twice a week. Remember, you also can break up the time into smaller chunks, such as 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes in the evening, to fit a jam-packed schedule. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Time It Right &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The great thing about walking is you can do it practically anytime and anywhere. However, certain times of day may be especially advantageous. Studies show that walking after meals is more effective at reducing blood sugar spikes and managing blood sugar levels than exercising before eating. Research has found this to be true for people both with and without type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve been in the habit of plopping yourself down on the couch post-meal, try lacing up your sneakers instead. Hawk adds, “If you only have time for one walk a day, making it after your biggest meal can give you the most bang for your buck.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Kick It Up a Notch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A leisurely walk is a great start, but a little more intensity will yield even bigger benefits. Kimberlain suggests aiming for a brisk pace that gets your heart rate up and pumping but still allows you to carry on a conversation. For most people, that’s a 3- to 4-mile-per-hour pace, she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can also do intervals, such as speed walking for 1 minute, followed by 3 minutes of moderate walking. If that feels good, repeat the cycle a few times to challenge yourself. Or, if you have hills in your neighborhood, incorporate a few hill repeats throughout your walk. Need a structured plan?

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walking is the No. 1 most underrated exercise for diabetes.  Research shows that walking can help improve insulin sensitivity, lower blood sugar levels and support heart health. Plus, it’s free, simple and you can do it virtually anywhere. So, whether you prefer to take it outdoors, on a treadmill, at the beach or even the stairs, there are lots of places to get those steps in!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering how much is enough, experts recommend 150 minutes per week. But if you’re not there yet, start slowly and increase as you get more comfortable. And don’t feel like you have to do it all at once—you can easily break it down into several small walks. Whether you do 10 15-minute walks, five 30-minute walks or two longer 75-minute walks, you’ll do good things for your blood sugar. Because when it comes to your health, every step counts!&lt;br&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;TRENTON, NJ. - The United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the first feline case of H5 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) or "bird flu" in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a New Jersey Department of Health press release, a feral cat from Hunterdon County developed severe symptoms including neurologic signs, and tested positive for the disease. The cat was humanely euthanized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other cats on the same property were also reported ill.  Officials say one additional indoor-outdoor cat also tested positive. There are tests still pending, and the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey case comes after previous national reports of confirmed feline cases in other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials advise caution, but say the public health risk of H5 HPAI remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While H5 HPAI has been detected in humans in the U.S. – primarily in individuals with close contact with infected poultry or dairy cattle – there have been no human cases reported in New Jersey, and none of the cases across the country are known to have resulted from exposure to an infected cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials are working closely with the New Jersey Department of Health in conducting follow up and symptom monitoring on individuals that have been in contact with these cats. All exposed individuals are currently asymptomatic. Residents who have had close, unprotected contact with a cat or other animal infected with H5 HPAI should contact their local health department and monitor themselves for symptoms for 10 days following their last exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the risk of H5 infection to the general population remains low at this time, it is important for people to learn more about the situation and take steps to avoid potential infection through exposure to animals, including feral cats,” said New Jersey Health Commissioner Kaitlan Baston, MD, MSc, DFASAM. “We continue to work with state and federal partners to monitor the spread of this virus and provide public information on mitigating the risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats are particularly susceptible to H5 HPAI and often experience severe disease and high mortality when infected. Potential exposure sources of H5 HPAI for cats include consuming raw (unpasteurized) milk or raw/undercooked meat contaminated with the virus, infected birds or other animals and their environments, or exposure to contaminated clothing or items (fomites) worn or used on affected premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cats tied to this incident in Hunterdon County had no known reported exposures to infected poultry, livestock, or consumption of raw (unpasteurized) milk or meat, but did roam freely outdoors, so exposure to wild birds or other animals is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats who have been infected with the virus may display the following symptoms: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General signs: Loss of appetite, fever, lethargy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respiratory signs: Discharge from the eyes and mouth, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurologic signs: Seizures, circling, wobbling gait, blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey residents should contact their veterinarian immediately if they are concerned that their cat may have H5 bird flu. Anyone who suspects a possible exposure or who has H5 HPAI concerns about their cat should contact their veterinarian prior to bringing the cat in to be seen so that the veterinarian can take the necessary precautions to prevent spread of disease. Residents who observe a sick stray or feral cat should contact their local animal control for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterinarians who suspect H5 HPAI in a cat should follow CDC recommendations to help protect themselves and prevent exposures, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling the cats. All suspect feline cases should be reported to the New Jersey Department of Health Communicable Disease Service at 609-826-4872 or &lt;a href="mailto:zoonoticrn@doh.nj.gov" target="_blank"&gt;zoonoticrn@doh.nj.gov&lt;/a&gt;. Testing for suspect feline cases is available at the New Jersey Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory, a member of the USDA’s National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Guidance for veterinarians on specimen collection and submission can be found here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey residents can find additional information and recommendations on ways to help prevent H5 bird flu infection in cats from the &lt;a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/animal-health-and-welfare/animal-health/avian-influenza/avian-influenza-h5n1-cats" target="_blank"&gt;American Veterinary Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, cat owners can take the following steps to help protect their pets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not feed cats raw (unpasteurized) milk or dairy products, and avoid feeding any raw or undercooked meat treats or diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep cats indoors to prevent exposure to birds and other wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep cats away from livestock, poultry, and their environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid contact with sick or dead birds and other wildlife yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoroughly wash your hands after handling your cat and after any encounters with poultry, livestock, or wild birds and other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change your clothes and shoes, and thoroughly wash any exposed skin, after interacting with sick or dead animals that may harbor the H5N1 virus, and before interacting with your cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact a veterinarian if you notice signs of H5 HPAI or think your cat might have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The H5N1 virus has the ability to move from one species to another,” New Jersey Agriculture Secretary Ed Wengryn said. "That is why we have worked closely with our poultry and dairy industries on biosecurity measures to prevent exposure by wild animals, and feral cats are another example of the risks to livestock and humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite low risk to the public, avian influenza is believed to be present in wild birds in all of New Jersey’s counties,” Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette said. “The Department of Environmental Protection continues to work closely with state and federal partners to track and respond to avian flu in wild birds and keep the public informed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find sick or dead wild birds, do not handle them. Contact the NJDEP’s Fish and Wildlife hotline at 1-877-WARNDEP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To report sick or dead poultry, do not handle them. Contact the NJDA Division of Animal Health at 609-671-6400.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, go to &lt;a href="http://NJ.gov/H5N1" target="_blank"&gt;NJ.gov/H5N1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There are certain stereotypes about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/feel-like-you-talk-too-much-a-new-study-shows-people-may-like-it"&gt;how relatively chatty&lt;/a&gt; men and women are, but what does the science say? A comprehensive new study shows that women tend to do more talking for much of the middle period of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study found that between the ages of 25 and 64, early to middle adulthood, women average 3,275 more words per day than men – or 20 more &lt;a href="https://www.typingmaster.com/speech-speed-test/"&gt;talking minutes&lt;/a&gt;. Across the other age ranges, the figures were more or less the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There is a strong cross-cultural assumption that women talk a lot more than men," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/do-women-talk-more-men-it-might-depend-their-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; clinical psychologist Colin Tidwell, from the University of Arizona. "We wanted to see whether or not this assumption holds when empirically tested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152856" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152856" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/WordSpread.jpg" alt="Word charts" class="wp-image-152856 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/WordSpread.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/WordSpread-568x415.jpg 568w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/WordSpread-600x438.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152856" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The spread of chattiness across men and women. (Tidwell et al., &lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers were involved &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1139940"&gt;in a 2007 study&lt;/a&gt; that found men and women spoke about the same number of words per day – 16,000 or so. This time the research team went bigger: 2,197 participants, four countries, 14 years of data collection, and a breakdown across different age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snippets of chats were collected at random times using a specially designed electronic recording device worn by the participants during their day-to-day lives. A total of 631,030 ambient audio clips were used, and processed through statistical models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new data revealed nuances the 2007 study missed, including the discrepancy in early to middle adulthood. What the data doesn't show is the reason for this gap – but the researchers think mothers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/talking-to-your-baby-could-change-their-brain-on-a-cellular-level"&gt;chatting to kids&lt;/a&gt; could be one reason, with gender roles often having &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-ever-women-in-their-30s-are-having-more-babies-than-20-somethings"&gt;women&lt;/a&gt; shoulder most of the burden of childcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If biological factors like hormones were to be the main cause, a sizable gender difference should have also been present among emerging adults," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/do-women-talk-more-men-it-might-depend-their-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychologist Matthias Mehl, from the University of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If societal generational changes were to be the driving force, there should have been a gradually increasing gender difference with older participants. Neither, though, was the case."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of variation between men and women across the ages – a lot of the people involved didn't conform to the statistical norm. There were talkative and taciturn individuals in both genders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The least chatty participant was a man, who managed a mere 62 words per day. The most chatty participant was also a man, who reached 124,134 words per day: assuming he slept for eight hours in every 24, that's almost 130 words every waking minute of his day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that people are talking less over time, regardless of age and gender – something the researchers put down to more and more screen time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="docos-replyview-body docos-anchoredreplyview-body docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable docos-replyview-body-emoji-reactable-background" dir="ltr"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even though this study is much larger than the 2007 one, there is even more uncertainty in the results, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, in early and middle adulthood, women were found to say between 1,500 and 3,600 more words per day compared to men. That's quite a large spectrum, with the bottom range representing just 10 minutes or so of normal-paced talking and the upper range representing 23 minutes. Much larger sample sizes are needed to tease apart all the various confounding factors that could be impacting these results other than sex or gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future studies, the team wants to look more closely at our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;chatting habits&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-a-speech-trait-that-foreshadows-cognitive-decline"&gt;overall well-being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The evidence is very strong that socializing is linked to health, at least to the same extent as physical activity and sleep are," &lt;a href="https://news.arizona.edu/news/do-women-talk-more-men-it-might-depend-their-age"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Mehl. "It's just another health behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2025-66513-001?doi=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Personality and Social Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies reveal that people with Down syndrome (DS) have over a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9387748/" target="_blank"&gt;90% lifetime risk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-people-down-syndrome" target="_blank"&gt;developing dementia&lt;/a&gt; caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD) as they age. Research from the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering aims could uncover why some people with DS develop dementia while others do not— providing insight that could ultimately benefit the entire DS community.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"A Neuropathology Case Report of a Woman with Down Syndrome who Remained Cognitively Stable: Implications for Resilience to Neuropathology," a new publication in &lt;i&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/i&gt;, found an unexpected Alzheimer's disease progression in an woman with Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ten years, a woman with Down syndrome participated in the Alzheimer Biomarker Consortium—Down syndrome Research Study (ABC-DS) with a team of investigators including Elizabeth Head, professor in the department of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of California, Irvine. At the time of her passing, investigators were grateful for her gift of brain donation, and her brain was shared with the University of Pittsburgh's 7T Bioengineering Research Program radiofrequency research facility, where Jr-Jiun Liou, postdoctoral scholar in the department of bioengineering, imaged her brain using the team's high-resolution &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-04-tic-tac-toe-themed-mri-technology-easy-neurological.html"&gt;7 Tesla MRI scanner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are interested in trying to link neuroimaging with neuropathology, because we want to use information from neuropathology datasets to inform diagnostic and therapeutic criteria for individuals with Down syndrome before they pass away," Liou said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final neuroimages that Liou reviewed surprised her. Although the participant was cognitively stable at the time of death, MRI imaging revealed the presence of neuropathology indicative of Alzheimer's disease in her brain. This finding highlighted a discrepancy between her lived experience and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+diagnosis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; compared to her underlying biological pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Before she passed away, all the clinical assessments in our years of studying her indicated that she was cognitively stable, which is why this case is so fascinating," Liou said. "Despite her brain's pathology indicating Alzheimer's, we think that her cognitive stability could have been attributed to her high education level or underlying &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic factors&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liou and Head hope that this case study will help improve existing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diagnostic+tools/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diagnostic tools&lt;/a&gt; and expand the inclusion criteria for therapeutic drug trials targeting Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Clinical trials typically have narrow criteria for acceptance, but if more individuals with this type of "hidden" pathology for Alzheimer's are included, the treatments could become more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also presents a rare opportunity to uncover genetic or lifestyle factors that may contribute to cognitive preservation—insights that could ultimately benefit not only individuals with Down syndrome but the broader population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can identify the genetic underpinnings or lifestyle factors that allowed her brain to function well despite the pathology, we may uncover strategies that could benefit others," Head said. "This study shows how just one person's participation in research can lead to profound discoveries."&lt;/p&gt;

Two related studies, the latest published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-025-01500-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;npj Digital Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, investigated the connection between driving patterns and depression in older individuals. The findings indicate that changes in driving behavior, detectable through everyday technology, could be analyzed by artificial intelligence to identify older adults who may be experiencing depression, a condition that often goes unnoticed in this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Older adults are driving longer, yet we know little about how mental health conditions like major depressive disorder (MDD) impact real-world driving behavior,” said study author Ganesh M. Babulal, an associate professor at Washington University in St. Louis and director of &lt;a href="https://drivesproject.wustl.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the DRIVES Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that depression is associated with cognitive and motor impairments, we wanted to examine whether older drivers with MDD exhibit riskier driving patterns that could affect safety and independence. Understanding these patterns is crucial for developing interventions that help older adults maintain mobility while minimizing risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2828519" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;first conducted a study&lt;/a&gt; to understand how depression might affect the actual driving behavior of older adults in their everyday lives. This initial study involved 395 participants, some diagnosed with major depressive disorder and others without. All participants were at least 65 years old and were part of a larger, ongoing project examining aging, driving, and depression at Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group with depression included 85 individuals who had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder by a clinician, or who scored high on a depression questionnaire called the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The control group consisted of 310 individuals without a diagnosis of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants underwent clinical assessments, including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) to evaluate cognitive function, and completed neuropsychological tests to measure different aspects of thinking and memory. Crucially, all participants had a small device placed in their personal vehicles. This device, connected to the car’s computer system, used GPS technology to continuously record their driving behavior over time, capturing data such as speed, location, and events like sudden braking or sharp turns. The researchers collected this driving data for a period of time and then analyzed it to see if there were noticeable differences in the driving patterns of those with and without depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first study revealed that older adults with depression exhibited distinct driving patterns compared to those without depression. Even though there were no significant differences in their cognitive test scores at the start of the study, those with depression demonstrated riskier driving behaviors over time. Specifically, they had more instances of hard braking and hard cornering during their trips. They also showed less predictable driving routes and traveled to a wider range of destinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, at the beginning of the study, the group with depression showed a tendency for speeding and spent more time driving overall. These findings suggested that depression is indeed linked to changes in driving behavior that could potentially increase the risk of accidents. Importantly, these differences in driving behavior were observed even after considering the use of medications that could impact driving, indicating that depression itself was a significant factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected some impact of MDD on driving, but we were surprised by the extent of risky behaviors, including increased driving distances and unpredictability in destinations,” Babulal told PsyPost. “Rather than self-regulating their driving, as many older adults do when experiencing cognitive or physical decline, those with MDD continued riskier driving patterns over time. This suggests that depression may impair awareness of functional changes, which has important safety implications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on these findings, the researchers then conducted a second study to investigate whether artificial intelligence could be used to automatically detect depression in older adults based on their driving data. This follow-up study used machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without explicit programming. For this study, they analyzed two years of driving data from 157 older adults, including 81 diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 76 without. The participants were recruited from the same ongoing research project and met similar criteria as in the first study. The driving data was collected using the same GPS devices in their cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to driving data, the researchers also collected information on demographics, such as age, gender, and education level, and medication use, including whether participants were taking antidepressants and the total number of different medications they used. They then trained machine learning models, specifically using a method called Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and also logistic regression, to see if these models could learn to distinguish between depressed and non-depressed older adults based on their driving data and other information. They tested various models, some using only driving features, some adding demographic information, and others incorporating medication data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The machine learning models were able to identify depression with a good degree of accuracy based on driving data alone. The best performing model, which combined driving features with information on the total number of medications participants were taking, achieved a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between depressed and non-depressed individuals. This top model correctly identified individuals with depression in 90% of cases and accurately identified those without depression in 82% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The driving features that were most important for identifying depression included the rate of hard cornering and hard braking, as well as the number of trips of different lengths. Surprisingly, adding demographic information like age, gender, and education did not improve the performance of the models and, in some cases, even made them slightly less accurate. This suggests that driving behavior and medication use are stronger indicators of depression in older adults than demographic factors alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression in older adults is not just about mood—it can also affect complex daily behaviors like driving,” Babulal said. “This highlights the importance of routine depression screening and targeted interventions to promote safer driving habits while supporting older adults’ independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers suggest that future studies should include larger groups of participants and follow them for longer periods. They also recommend incorporating more detailed health information, such as electronic health records, and exploring more advanced artificial intelligence techniques to further refine the accuracy of depression detection. Future research could also investigate how to better ensure that driving data truly reflects the behavior of the intended participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While our study provides valuable insights, it does not establish causality—MDD is associated with changes in driving behavior, but we cannot conclude that depression directly causes these changes,” Babulal noted. “Additionally, our sample was predominantly non-Hispanic White, so additional research is needed to explore these effects in more diverse, representative populations. We also did not track changes in depression symptoms over time, which could influence driving behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aim to refine strategies for identifying older adults at risk for unsafe driving due to mental health conditions like MDD. Future research will explore whether interventions—such as cognitive training, medication management, or driving modifications—can help mitigate these risks. Ultimately, we hope to develop clinical and policy recommendations that balance safety with the need for mobility and independence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to older driver safety, including mental health assessment,” Babulal added. “Depression is treatable, and addressing it proactively could improve both driving safety and overall well-being. We encourage older adults and their families to discuss driving concerns with healthcare providers and explore resources for safer mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-01500-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Identifying major depressive disorder in older adults through naturalistic driving behaviors and machine learning&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Chen Chen, David C.
