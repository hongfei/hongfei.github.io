Researchers found that maternal stress altered entire families of tRNA fragments in umbilical cord blood, particularly those regulating acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes were most dramatic in female newborns and were linked to an imbalance in stress regulation mechanisms. The findings highlight the importance of addressing maternal mental health for the lifelong wellbeing of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Maternal stress caused more dramatic molecular changes in female newborns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cholinergic System Disruption:&lt;/strong&gt; Stress reprogrammed tRNA fragments regulating acetylcholine, affecting brain and immune function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Detection Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning could classify exposed newborns with 95% accuracy based on molecular profiles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study led by Prof. Hermona Soreq and Shani Vaknine Treidel from the Edmond and Lily Safra Center of Brain Science (ELSC) at Hebrew University, uncovers how stress experienced during pregnancy can affect newborns at the molecular level – with significant differences between male and female babies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry,&lt;/em&gt; focused on perceived prenatal stress (PPS) – the mother’s own sense of psychological stress during pregnancy – and discovered that it can reprogram key molecular pathways in the baby’s body, especially those linked to the cholinergic system, which governs stress response and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109192"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a pregnant woman and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/maternal-trauma-child-immune-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These molecular changes could help explain why children exposed to high maternal stress during pregnancy may be more vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions later in life. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that even before babies take their first breath, the stress their mothers experience can shape how their bodies manage stress themselves,” said Prof. Soreq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed umbilical cord blood from babies born to mothers who reported high stress levels during the third trimester. They focused on small RNA molecules called tRNA fragments (tRFs), which regulate gene expression much like microRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they found was remarkable: the stress didn’t just alter individual tRFs—it affected entire families of tRFs, particularly those with origins in mitochondrial DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes were sex-specific, with female newborns showing the most dramatic shifts, including a near-complete decline in specific mitochondrial tRFs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these tRFs, termed “CholinotRFs,” target genes that govern acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter essential for both brain function and immune regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also measured levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborns of stressed mothers—especially boys—had significantly higher levels of AChE, suggesting an imbalance in their stress-response system right from birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These molecular changes could help explain why children exposed to high maternal stress during pregnancy may be more vulnerable to neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using machine learning techniques, the researchers were able to accurately classify female newborns as exposed or unexposed to maternal stress based on their CholinotRF profiles, achieving a classification success rate (AUC) of 95%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opens the door to new diagnostic tools for detecting prenatal stress effects and possibly even early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides a powerful glimpse into how the maternal environment can leave a lasting biological imprint on the next generation,” said Vaknine Treidel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also underscores the importance of recognizing and supporting mental health during pregnancy—not just for the mother, but for the lifelong health of the child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted as part of the international FELICITy project, in collaboration with the Technical University of Munich and the University of Washington, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples were collected from over 120 mother-infant pairs and analyzed at the Hebrew University’s Center for Genomic Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2

prenatal stress induces sex-dependent changes in tRNA fragment families and cholinergic pathways in newborns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal perceived prenatal stress (PPS) is a known risk factor for diverse developmental impairments in newborns, but the underlying molecular processes are incompletely understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that maternal PPS altered the birth profiles of blood transfer RNA fragments (tRFs), 16–50 nt long non-random cleavage products of tRNAs, in a sex-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, comparing stressed versus control maternal and umbilical cord blood serum presented alterations that were not limited to individual tRFs, but rather reflected selective changes in particular tRF families grouped by their mitochondrial or nuclear genome origin, parental tRNA coded amino acid, and cleavage type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, tRF families that show stress- and sex-specific effects, revealed shared length and expression patterns which were strongest in the female newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of these tRFs carry complementary motifs to particular cholinergic mRNAs, suggesting possible translational regulation similar to microRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compatible with the cholinergic regulation of stress reactions, those “CholinotRFs” achieved an AUC of 95% when classifying female newborns according to maternal PPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we found altered catalytic activity of serum acetylcholinesterase, which was particularly elevated in male newborns, marking a second sex-specific effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings demonstrate an association of tRF families’ patterns with newborns’ sex-specific stress response to PPS and may lead to better diagnosis and therapeutic tools for these and other stressors.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025

Scientists found that aging triggers adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs) to evolve into committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As), which actively generate new fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A signaling pathway called LIFR was found to drive this fat-cell proliferation.

Belly fat accelerates aging and slows down metabolism, increasing our risk for developing diabetes, heart problems and other chronic diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how age transforms a six pack into a softer stomach, however, is murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now preclinical research by City of Hope, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States and a leading research center for diabetes and other life-threatening illnesses, has uncovered the cellular culprit behind age-related abdominal fat, providing new insights into why our midsections widen with middle age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109188"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two overweight men." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/belly-fat-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers focused on adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs), a group of stem cells in WAT that evolve into fat cells. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published today in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the findings suggest a novel target for future therapies to prevent belly flab and extend our healthy lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People often lose muscle and gain body fat as they age—even when their body weight remains the same,” said Qiong (Annabel) Wang, Ph.D., the study’s co-corresponding author and an associate professor of molecular and cellular endocrinology at City of Hope’s Arthur Riggs Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolism Research Institute, one of the world’s foremost scientific organizations dedicated to investigating the biology and treatment of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered aging triggers the arrival of a new type of adult stem cell and enhances the body’s massive production of new fat cells, especially around the belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the UCLA laboratory co-corresponding author Xia Yang, Ph.D., the scientists conducted a series of mouse experiments later validated on human cells. Wang and her colleagues focused on white adipose tissue (WAT), the fatty tissue responsible for age-related weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s well-known that fat cells grow larger with age, the scientists suspected that WAT also expanded by producing new fat cells, meaning it may have an unlimited potential to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the researchers focused on adipocyte progenitor cells (APCs), a group of stem cells in WAT that evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The City of Hope team first transplanted APCs from young and older mice into a second group of young mice. The APCs from the older animals rapidly generated a colossal amount of fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team transplanted APCs from young mice into the older mice, however, the stem cells did not manufacture many new fat cells. The results confirmed that older APCs are equipped to independently make new fat cells, regardless of their host’s age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the scientists next compared APC gene activity in young and older mice. While barely active in young mice, APCs woke up with a vengeance in middle-aged mice and began pumping out new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While most adult stem cells’ capacity to grow wanes with age, the opposite holds true with APCs — aging unlocks these cells’ power to evolve and spread,” said Adolfo Garcia-Ocana, Ph.D., the Ruth B. &amp;amp; Robert K. Lanman Endowed Chair in Gene Regulation &amp;amp; Drug Discovery Research and chair of the Department of Molecular &amp;amp; Cellular Endocrinology at City of Hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first evidence that our bellies expand with age due to the APCs’ high output of new fat cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging also transformed the APCs into a new type of stem cell called committed preadipocytes, age-specific (CP-As). Arising in middle age, CP-A cells actively churn out new fat cells, explaining why older mice gain more weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A signaling pathway called leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) proved critical for promoting these CP-A cells to multiply and evolve into fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that the body’s fat-making process is driven by LIFR. While young mice don’t require this signal to make fat, older mice do,” explained Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research indicates that LIFR plays a crucial role in triggering CP-As to create new fat cells and expand belly fat in older mice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing on samples from people of various ages, Wang and her colleagues next studied APCs from human tissue in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the team also identified similar CP-A cells that had an increased number in middle-aged people’s tissue. Their discovery also illustrates that CP-As in humans have high capacity in creating new fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of controlling new fat-cell formation to address age-related obesity,” said Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding the role of CP-As in metabolic disorders and how these cells emerge during aging could lead to new medical solutions for reducing belly fat and improving health and longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will focus on tracking CP-A cells in animal models, observing CP-A cells in humans and developing new strategies that eliminate or block the cells to prevent age-related fat gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s first authors are City of Hope’s Guan Wang, Ph.D., and UCLA’s Gaoyan Li, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this weight gain and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#58343d35392a292d3d22183b373076372a3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Letisia Marquez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://coh.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;City of Hope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Letisia Marquez – City of Hope&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adj0430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct adipose progenitor cells emerging with age drive active adipogenesis&lt;/a&gt;” by Qiong A. Wang et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct adipose progenitor cells emerging with age drive active adipogenesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adipose tissue plays a crucial role in regulating various hormonal and metabolic processes and demonstrates substantial compositional and phenotypic plasticity. From middle age to early aging, adults often experience a notable increase in visceral adipose tissue mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visceral adiposity is believed to be an important risk factor for various metabolic disorders. The accumulation of adipose tissue occurs through two primary mechanisms: adipocyte hypertrophy and adipogenesis. However, the mechanisms by which early aging contributes to adipose tissue accumulation remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adipogenesis is the process by which new adipocytes are generated through the proliferation and differentiation of adipose progenitor cells (APCs). Previous reports suggested that APCs exhibit a reduced capacity for adipogenesis in aged humans or rodents in an in vitro, two-dimensional (2D) culture setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this work, we used in vivo lineage tracing mouse models, 3D profiling of APC transplants to monitor adipogenesis of APCs up to middle age, and single-cell RNA sequencing to identify distinct types of APCs generated during this life stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional assessments of these age-specific APCs provide insights into how adipogenesis contributes to visceral adipose tissue accumulation during middle age and early aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 12 months old, male mice gained body weight due to increased adipose tissue mass, especially in the visceral site. By contrast, female mice only had moderate body weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking adipogenesis in lineage-tracing mouse models revealed that in contrast to the low turnover rate of adipocytes in young adults, more than 80% of adipocytes were newly generated in the visceral adipose tissue of 12-month-old male mice fed a standard chow diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with this massive adipogenesis, middle-aged mice developed adipocyte hypotrophy, visceral adiposity, reduced energy expenditure, and insulin resistance. 3D profiling of APC transplants quantitatively showed that APCs in middle-aged mice had a much higher adipogenic rate than those in young mice, indicating that these APCs cell-autonomously obtain higher adipogenic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-cell RNA sequencing of APCs then identified a new committed preadipocyte population that is age enriched (CP-A), both in mice and humans. CP-As displayed high proliferation and differentiation capacities, both in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of CP-As in the visceral adipose tissue increased when mice were 9 months old, peaked when they were 12 months old, and then sharply declined when they were 18 months old. Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) was identified as a functional marker of CP-A. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic manipulations indicated that LIFR is indispensable for CP-A adipogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inhibition of LIFR did not affect the adipogenesis of young APCs, indicating that LIFR signaling is specifically required for CP-As. Lastly, chronic treatment with a LIFR inhibitor during early aging prevented the expansion of visceral fat in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating in vivo lineage-tracing, 3D profiling of transplants, and single-cell RNA sequencing, our work reveals that adipogenesis of APCs contributes greatly to the visceral adipose tissue expansion during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery of CP-A as an age-specific APC population, along with the validation of its high adipogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo, and the identification of LIFR signaling as a CP-A–specific adipogenic mechanism enhance our understanding of the early aging process in fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding from our work is that despite the low turnover rate of adipocytes in young adults, adipogenesis is unlocked during middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase of adipogenic capacity in APCs distinguishes these cells from most other adult stem cells, which typically exhibit a reduced capacity to proliferate and differentiate with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as the enhancement of adipogenesis and emergence of the CP-A population happens primarily in the male visceral adipose tissue and only during middle age and early aging, these events are location, stage, and sex specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings offer a fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of age-related metabolic disorders, which may have critical implications for preventing and treating age-related diseases, thereby promoting healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 13:59:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFAwdzVPVGdTSENGbWV6anlxSk5Oamdrd2Nic0ZKbFZqNTdmcEljbVFKMHVmc3RLbVhiclZyZHhKWlNvZzVkM0Z2TjJfc21LR0J4NlR5cU5UZlQ2bWxiVDRPSXE1VXN0aVN5ZEFSVkJRdWZpZw</guid></item><item><title>“现在我们有了选择” ：科学家们试图治愈我们的过敏症--《卫报》 | ‘Now we have options’: the scientists trying to cure our allergies - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQVG1Vbkg2WTRSXzJxVzRSZFVCRWZhbEY0U05KN2JQRWh1V1E0dThrSEoyNGFDS2ZPX1FGV0d0YUJ6Z3BhTm9yeHFyeF9jN2tYa1p1cHJSQWV1ZzhmQUxjeXY0Q2kxTU9XR1llRllWVnlXdk9sSkZwV3Y2Rlp1bGtVRTNlcVppUF95ZUdzeHltN0tXUTVMYnNEY3ZoTVFqc19EYnJvakFmR0hxeG95dGNRSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; severe food allergy is among the few conditions that can propel a person from robust health to unconsciousness within minutes, and the risk of accidental exposure often casts a shadow of anxiety over those affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But change is afoot, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/24/daily-peanut-exposure-can-desensitise-allergic-adults-study-suggests" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;groundbreaking trial &lt;/a&gt;this week showing that two-thirds of adults with severe peanut allergies can be desensitised through clinically supervised daily exposure.

Food anaphylaxis admissions to UK hospitals increased threefold from 1998 to 2018, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33597169/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to one analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of people affected by less severe allergies has also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00163-4/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;risen significantly&lt;/a&gt;, with factors including weaning practices, detergents and lack of childhood contact with dirt and animals all potential drivers of the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Exposure as treatment is not a new idea: the first successful use of oral immunotherapy for a 13-year-old boy with egg allergy was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11250212/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reported in The Lancet in 1908&lt;/a&gt;. But in the past decade, scientists have developed the incremental dosing protocols required to move this concept into the clinic. The licensing of the drug Palforzia – pharmaceutical-grade peanut protein – means the treatment can now be delivered to those whose allergies are extreme enough that a few milligrams too much peanut protein could trigger anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The treatment regimes are intensive, requiring fortnightly dosage escalations and a level of clinical supervision that has resulted in paediatric NHS waiting lists of several years. And, for most, they are not a cure – patients have an increased tolerance to low doses, but need to maintain daily exposure and are still considered allergic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The issue with eating a peanut every day is that you’re on a bit of a tightrope,” says Prof Graham Roberts, an allergy specialist at the University of Southampton. “You might still have a life-threatening allergic reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is also a growing cohort of patients managing multiple allergies, for whom the approach is impractical. “That’s where the advantage of treatments that are completely agnostic to the food you’re allergic to comes in,” says Wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Food allergies normally involve a class of potent antibodies, called IgEs, that bind to immune cells 1,000 times more tightly than other classes of antibody and which scientists think originally evolved to protect the body from parasites. Now, largely redundant in modern lifestyles, they have a weakness for misfiring in response to food proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;landmark study last year&lt;/a&gt;, Wood and his colleagues found that the anti-IgE drug omalizumab, already licensed for severe asthma, could desensitise people to peanut, cashew, milk, egg, walnut, wheat and hazelnut allergies (participants were allergic to at least three) by mopping up the antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The treatment is “not without some burden”, Wood acknowledges, requiring ongoing fortnightly injections of a drug with an annual list price of between &lt;a href="https://www.xolair.com/cost.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;$30,000 and $60,000&lt;/a&gt;. But it can be life-changing for those who need to avoid pervasive products such as milk, eggs and wheat. “Those families don’t travel without a cooler full of food,” Wood says. “They can’t eat out. They can’t trust anyone to prepare anything for their child. Your day-to-day life is massively compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;New products in the pipeline could further lower the bar for treatment, including a &lt;a href="https://brandonbiocatalyst.com/2024/10/28/aravax-completes-recruitment-into-phase-2-study-of-pvx108-a-novel-immunotherapy-for-the-treatment-of-peanut-allergy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peanut allergy vaccine candidate&lt;/a&gt; being developed by the Australian biotech firm Aravax (the phase 2 trial still involved monthly injections) and a &lt;a href="https://www.anaphylaxis.org.uk/peanut-allergy-patch-shows-promising-long-term-results-in-3-year-study/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;peanut patch&lt;/a&gt; developed by the French company DBV that recently showed promising results in a three-year trial.

While immunotherapy does not reverse most food allergies, for bee stings it has a higher than 90% cure rate. Prof Markus Ollert, of the Luxembourg Institute of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;, tracked patients treated for bee sting allergies and revealed that a molecule called interleukin-6 appears to act as a switch in the transition from being allergic to tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Others are focused on trying to prevent allergies arising in the first place. A primary culprit for the rise in allergies appears to have been misguided medical advice in the 1990s that parents should avoid giving babies foods such as peanuts in the first year of life. “Since then we’ve seen an absolute explosion in allergies,” says Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a randomised trial, he and colleagues found that introducing peanuts into the diet at four months led to an 80% reduction in allergies. Another, more recent study, found large reductions in peanut, egg, wheat and cows’ milk allergies when introduced to babies from three months of age. However, despite iron-clad evidence that early introduction is protective, it has proved difficult to undo warnings around the dangers of introducing peanuts too early and change parents’ behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQVG1Vbkg2WTRSXzJxVzRSZFVCRWZhbEY0U05KN2JQRWh1V1E0dThrSEoyNGFDS2ZPX1FGV0d0YUJ6Z3BhTm9yeHFyeF9jN2tYa1p1cHJSQWV1ZzhmQUxjeXY0Q2kxTU9XR1llRllWVnlXdk9sSkZwV3Y2Rlp1bGtVRTNlcVppUF95ZUdzeHltN0tXUTVMYnNEY3ZoTVFqc19EYnJvakFmR0hxeG95dGNRSQ</guid></item><item><title>大脑网络揭示精神病症状如何随时间变化-神经科学新闻 | Brain Networks Reveal How Psychosis Symptoms Change Over Time - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTFByODhfeGNUUGtMQkVsMHZyc05FX1FpQkdzMXhPX0k2UGhQWjhjN1ktOGRONlluQ0FWVm85aF9DVHRoMVp4RkJHazZRRTdZNnpnS1NnX1ZkSklBcURJREhaYktrQ1JjU3BKUGdYNmpEMG1uQUg2QlYwRml3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study explores how brain networks differ between patients in early and chronic stages of psychosis, shedding light on symptom evolution. Researchers mapped connectivity patterns and found that disruptions in the frontoparietal network are key to both early and chronic psychosis symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning on brain imaging data, the team could predict positive and negative symptoms with stronger predictions in chronic cases. These findings may help identify biomarkers for earlier interventions and improve treatment strategies before symptoms worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Brain Network:&lt;/strong&gt; Disruptions in the frontoparietal network are linked to psychosis symptoms across stages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Modeling:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine learning models accurately predicted symptom severity using brain connectivity patterns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Early identification of brain network disruptions could guide more effective, targeted interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Yale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients in the early stages of psychosis respond to treatments differently than those who have developed a chronic version of the disorder. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neurobiological changes from early to chronic stages is essential for developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies. But how symptoms change during this transition—and what role the brain plays—is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109180"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-network-psychosis-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While psychosis arises from a disruption across the whole brain, the team found the frontoparietal network played a critical role in both early and chronic psychosis. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) have now examined patients with early and chronic forms of psychosis to map symptom evolution and identify relevant brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They published their findings in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychopharmacology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in how psychosis and psychiatric disorders develop,” says Maya Foster, first author of the study and a PhD student in the lab of Dustin Scheinost, PhD, associate professor of radiology and biomedical imaging at YSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With this study, we looked at the underlying brain networks—regions that are functionally connected and work in coordination—to link brain areas to symptoms in patients with either early or chronic psychosis, and we assessed the similarities and differences between these networks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Treating psychosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of psychosis symptoms are not well understood but are broadly believed to result from disrupted or altered brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are known as “positive” symptoms of psychosis—in that they are added experiences healthy individuals don’t usually encounter—include hallucinations and delusions, while negative symptoms—or deficient versions of healthy experiences—include memory impairment, disorganized thinking, lack of motivation, and an inability to feel pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with psychosis often experience negative symptoms first. As their psychosis worsens, positive symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their shared symptom experiences, early and chronic cases respond to treatment differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Studies show that patients have better prognoses if they get treatment early,” says Foster. “Chronic psychosis has higher incidences of relapse, and available treatments do not work as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that early interventions reduce psychosis symptoms, but longitudinal studies that follow patients through the transition from early to chronic condition have not yet been done. Filling in this information gap could help clinicians more effectively treat patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin to address this gap, Foster and Scheinost examined two large-scale open source datasets to identify how symptoms evolve in patients with early or chronic psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Connectome Project Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset contains information for early psychosis patients who present with symptoms within five years of data collection. The Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences (SRPBS) Multi-disorder Connectivity dataset consists of patients with varying levels of symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HCP-EP dataset contained information for 107 participants, which was compared with data from 57 healthy participants. The SRPBS dataset contained information for 123 participants, which was compared with that of 99 healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mapping brain networks to psychosis symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify connectivity patterns in the brain that underpin psychosis symptoms, the team trained a machine learning model on functional magnetic resonance imaging data and symptom information collected from individuals with early or chronic psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the model was able to predict positive and negative symptoms in both groups. The predictions for the chronic psychosis population were stronger, likely because of greater symptom burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While psychosis arises from a disruption across the whole brain, the team found the frontoparietal network played a critical role in both early and chronic psychosis. This region of the brain is involved in cognitive flexibility, cognitive control, and coordinating behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Foster, negative symptoms may be linked to disruptions in the frontoparietal network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings provide a neurobiological reference point that could allow clinicians to track symptom-based brain networks as patients transition from early to chronic psychosis, say the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can characterize brain differences to better understand symptoms, then we could potentially identify targets or biomarkers,” says Scheinost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With more work, we might be able to predict transition points to monitor as you go along in treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could track patients over time to uncover how the identified brain networks change throughout the lifespan of psychosis. This approach could inform treatment options to improve care and prevent worsening of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster and Scheinost collaborated with psychiatrist Albert Powers, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at YSM and co-author of the study, to contextualize their findings.

P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;rediction effect sizes were higher in CP, and prediction of general psychopathology and total symptoms was only possible in CP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual lesioning analyses revealed the frontoparietal network as a critical component of EP and CP symptom networks. Predictive models were broadly similar between EP and CP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also generalized the EP positive score model to CP positive symptoms and identified group differences between CP and matched HCs more robustly than EP. Overall, broadly similar networks were found in CP and EP, but larger effects were observed in CP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide a foundation for longitudinal studies to track connectivity changes in symptom networks throughout the psychosis lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar stage-comparative approaches can enhance understanding of the etiology of early and chronic psychosis symptoms for therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 12:59:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFByODhfeGNUUGtMQkVsMHZyc05FX1FpQkdzMXhPX0k2UGhQWjhjN1ktOGRONlluQ0FWVm85aF9DVHRoMVp4RkJHazZRRTdZNnpnS1NnX1ZkSklBcURJREhaYktrQ1JjU3BKUGdYNmpEMG1uQUg2QlYwRml3</guid></item><item><title>福克斯新闻AI通讯：女人说ChatGPT救了她的命-福克斯新闻 | Fox News AI Newsletter: Woman says ChatGPT saved her life - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNWk1VRHFneGlxTU9lcGVSVzZkQU9taVBrVDc2WExZTlBoNlFJRUtxdlhWaFVPQXE5NFFjbVBnbVdIbExEOFQ2dUNUakZpMTVEUDdSUl9rMFpza2hIbW5rdGFhVTRHbWVFcVVQMHFPRDBTbjl2R1NfcGx3Rll3S3FyWGtR0gGHAUFVX3lxTE5WR2gyeTBidXFPSy1DQ1RFeGVQSHVEeUU1cmZGbGZ4V2x2dVk0dWtZbGtUbDFQOWFtb19KNGZKSzNGRHFSV0kyTGRKdWgzZHRXaEt1amNKMzgyb1lVdmFCeUFsLWwtaXc0dFNCZUdSSi01MEtTQlhPT21SVkt5YVFHd1l2M1VvMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Fox News’ Artificial Intelligence newsletter with the latest AI technology advancements.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;IN TODAY’S NEWSLETTER:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="speakable"&gt;- Woman says ChatGPT saved her life by helping detect cancer, which doctors missed&lt;br&gt;- Tesla launches test run for FSD Supervised, an AI-powered ride hailing service&lt;br&gt;- China's AI DeepSeek faces House probe over US data harvesting, CCP propaganda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lauren Bannon says ChatGPT helped diagnose her with cancer.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Kennedy News and Media)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'LUCKY TO BE ALIVE':&lt;/strong&gt; A mother of two credits ChatGPT for saving her life, claiming the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/woman-says-chatgpt-saved-her-life-helping-detect-cancer-which-doctors-missed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; chatbot flagged the condition leading to her cancer when doctors missed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AUTONOMY TEST RUN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/tesla-launches-test-run-fsd-supervised-ai-powered-ride-hailing-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Robotaxis&lt;/a&gt; are closer to becoming a reality, after Tesla launched a full self-driving (FSD) supervised ride-hailing service in Austin, Texas, and the San Francisco Bay Area "for an early set of employees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Robotaxi. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Kurt "CyberGuy" Knutsson)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HARVESTING YOUR DATA?:&lt;/strong&gt; A powerful House Committee is demanding information from DeepSeek on what U.S. data it used to train the AI model as members accuse the company of being in the pocket &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chinas-ai-deepseek-faces-house-probe-over-us-data-harvesting-ccp-propaganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;of the Chinese government.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(Reuters/Dado Ruvic/Illustration)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDUCATION REFORMS:&lt;/strong&gt; President &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-signs-education-focused-executive-orders-ai-school-discipline-accreditation-foreign-gifts-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signed multiple Executive Orders relating to education Wednesday afternoon, with several tied to the theme of returning meritocracy back to the education system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WORTH THE RISKS?:&lt;/strong&gt; If you haven’t heard the buzz about Manus yet, it's the new &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/first-autonomous-ai-agent-here-worth-risks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AI model&lt;/a&gt; unveiled by a Singapore-based company called Butterfly Effect.

In the study, daily light and sound exposure boosted performance in memory tasks and promoted gene activity linked to synaptic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found higher expression of genes protecting against aging and Alzheimer’s-like degeneration. While promising, further studies are needed to confirm whether similar benefits occur in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; 40Hz sensory stimulation enhanced short-term memory performance in Down syndrome mouse models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurogenesis Boost:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulated mice showed increased new neuron growth and synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Stimulation helped preserve neurons linked to cognitive resilience against Alzheimer’s pathology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studies by a growing number of labs have identified neurological health benefits from exposing human volunteers or animal models to light, sound and/or tactile stimulation at the brain’s “gamma” frequency rhythm of 40Hz. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest such research at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and Alana Down Syndrome Center at MIT, scientists found that 40Hz sensory stimulation improved cognition and circuit connectivity and encouraged the growth of new neurons in mice genetically engineered to model Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109172"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/brain-stimulation-memory-downs-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;About 90 percent of people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer’s disease, typically after the age of 40. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li-Huei Tsai, Picower Professor at MIT and senior author of the new study in &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;, said that the results are encouraging but also cautioned that much more work is needed to test whether the method, called GENUS (for Gamma Entrainment Using Sensory Stimulation), could provide clinical benefits for people with Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her lab has begun a small study with human volunteers at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this work, for the first time, shows beneficial effects of GENUS on Down syndrome using an imperfect mouse model, we need to be cautious as there is not yet data showing whether this also works in humans,” said Tsai, who directs The Picower Institute and The Alana Center, and is a member of MIT’s Brain and Cognitive Sciences faculty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she said, the newly published article adds evidence that GENUS can promote a broad-based, restorative, “homeostatic” health response in the brain amid a wide variety of pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most GENUS studies have addressed Alzheimer’s disease in humans or mice, but others have found benefits from the stimulation for conditions such as “chemo brain,” and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Down syndrome benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the research team led by postdoc Md Rezaul Islam and former graduate student Brennan Jackson worked with the commonly used “Ts65Dn” Down syndrome mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model recapitulates key aspects of the disorder, though it does not exactly mirror the human condition, which is caused by carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first set of experiments in the paper the team shows that an hour a day of 40Hz light and sound exposure for three weeks was associated with significant improvements on three standard short-term memory tests—two involving distinguishing novelty from familiarity and one involving spatial navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these kinds of memory tasks involve a brain region called the hippocampus, the researchers looked at neural activity there and measured a significant increase in activity indicators among mice that received the GENUS stimulation vs. those that did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how stimulated mice could show improved cognition, the researchers examined whether cells in the hippocampus changed how they express their genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the team used a technique called single cell RNA sequencing, which provided a readout of how nearly 16,000 individual neurons and other cells transcribed their DNA into RNA, a key step in gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the genes whose expression varied most prominently in neurons between the mice that received stimulation and those that did not were directly related to forming and organizing neural circuit connections called synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm the significance of that finding, the researchers directly examined the hippocampus in stimulated and control mice. They found that in a critical subregion, the dentate gyrus, stimulated mice had significantly more synapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diving deeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team not only examined gene expression across individual cells, but also analyzed that data to assess whether there were patterns of coordination across multiple genes. Indeed they found several such “modules” of co-expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of this evidence further substantiated the idea that 40Hz-stimulated mice made important improvements in synaptic connectivity, but another key finding highlighted a role for TCF4, a key regulator of gene transcription needed for generating new neurons, or “neurogenesis.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s analysis of genetic data suggested that TCF4 is underexpressed in Down syndrome mice but the researchers saw improved TCF4 expression in GENUS-stimulated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers went to the lab bench to determine whether the mice also exhibited a difference in neurogenesis, they found direct evidence that stimulated mice exhibited more than unstimulated mice in the dentate gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These increases in TCF4 expression and neurogenesis are only correlational, the researchers noted, but they hypothesize that the increase in new neurons likely helps explain at least some of the increase in new synapses and improved short term memory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increased putative functional synapses in the dentate gyrus is likely related to the increased adult neurogenesis observed in the Down syndrome mice following GENUS treatment,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to document that GENUS is associated with increased neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of gene expression modules also yielded other key insights. One is that a cluster of genes whose expression typically declines with normal aging and in Alzheimer’s disease, remained at higher expression levels among mice who received 40Hz sensory stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the researchers also found evidence that mice that received stimulation retained more cells in the hippocampus that express Reelin. Reelin-expressing neurons are especially vulnerable in Alzheimer’s disease, but expression of the protein is associated with cognitive resilience amid Alzheimer’s disease pathology, which Ts65Dn mice develop. About 90 percent of people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer’s disease, typically after the age of 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we found that GENUS enhances the percentage of Reln+ neurons in hippocampus of a mouse model of Down syndrome, suggesting that GENUS may promote cognitive resilience,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together with other studies, Tsai and Islam said, the new results add evidence that GENUS helps to stimulate the brain at the cellular and molecular level to mount a homeostatic response to aberrations caused by disease pathology, be it neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s, demyelination in chemo brain, or deficits of neurogenesis in Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the authors also cautioned that the study had limits. Not only is the Ts65Dn model an imperfect reflection of human Down syndrome, but also the mice used were all male. Moreover, the cognitive tests in the study only measured short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally, while the study was novel for extensively examining gene expression in the hippocampus amid GENUS stimulation, it did not look at changes in other cognitively critical brain regions such as the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Jackson, Islam and Tsai, the paper’s other authors are Maeesha Tasnim Naomi, Brooke Schatz, Noah Tan, Mitchell Murdock, Dong Shin Park, Daniela Rodrigues Amorim, Fred Jiang, S.

			&lt;p&gt;Trending weight loss drugs &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-wegovy-the-risks-and-side-effects-of-semaglutide-drugs"&gt;such as Ozempic and Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; may be highly effective at tackling obesity, but are they also carrying some darker side effects in the long run? A new study shows these medications could trigger brain changes linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="158963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic and Wegovy are both what's known as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 drugs), so named because they mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone found in the brain, gut, and pancreas. It helps to control blood sugar and appetite, just like the natural hormone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also know these GLP-1 drugs influence parts of the brain rich in dopamine, a key chemical in feelings of pleasure and reward, and are already being looked at as ways of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2024.107312"&gt;treating alcohol and drug addiction,&lt;/a&gt; in addition to obesity and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="158963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158966" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158966" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BrainMap-1.jpg" alt="Brain map" class="wp-image-158966 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BrainMap-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/BrainMap-1-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158966" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at how different messaging pathways in the brain might interact. (Sharafshah et al., &lt;em&gt;Curr. Neuropharmacol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this newly published paper, an international team of researchers has connected the dopamine disruption driven by GLP-1 drugs to potential depression and suicide ideation in people genetically disposed to hypodopaminergia – low dopamine function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The paper provides critical evidence for re-evaluating the widespread use of GLP-1 drugs," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1080906"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychiatrist Mark Gold of the Washington University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The FDA and other regulatory agencies should carefully consider our findings when it comes to labeling and monitoring these drugs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should note that this study relies on computer modeling: there were no lab tests or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="158963" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; done here. Instead, the researchers ran an analysis of GLP-1 drug genetic pathways linked to depression and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/premenstrual-disorders-linked-with-increased-risk-of-just-one-tragic-cause-of-death"&gt;suicide risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found interaction with the activity of certain genes – including DRD3, BDNF, CREB1, CRH, IL6, and DPP4. These genes check two boxes: they're associated with dopamine signaling and mood, and GLP-1 drugs could influence their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time this connection has been made, either. The European Medicines Agency is &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-statement-ongoing-review-glp-1-receptor-agonists"&gt;already investigating&lt;/a&gt; how people taking GLP-1 drugs may have increased thoughts of suicide and self-harm, based on reports from health professionals in Iceland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a review of side effects from GLP-1 drugs found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/rare-psychiatric-events-linked-to-ozempic-have-experts-concerned"&gt;1.2 percent were adverse psychiatric events&lt;/a&gt;, with depression the most commonly reported, followed by anxiety and suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research is still at its earliest stages, so we shouldn't jump to any conclusions yet, but given how different we all are in our genetics, our environments, and our reactions to drugs, it's crucial to find out as much as possible about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/are-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-for-you-consider-these-risks-and-benefits"&gt;potential GLP-1 drug side effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These treatments are still relatively new, and with each piece of research we're understanding more about how their chronic use may impact our health in the long run, whether that's how they can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-could-have-a-surprising-effect-on-drinking-habits"&gt;cut down on cravings&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;offer cardiovascular health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While GLP1-R drugs hold promise for treating addictive and behavioral disorders, we must remain vigilant about their potential harm," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1080906"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; psychiatrist Igor Elman of Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study is not intended to break the bubble of hope but to add a layer of precaution in their over-prescription."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2174/011570159X349579241231080602"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Neuropharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this story has raised concerns or you need to talk to someone, &lt;a href="http://www.suicidestop.com/call_a_hotline.html"&gt;please consult this list to find a 24/7 crisis hotline in your country, and reach out for help.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Michael Wolff spent 18 months undergoing intensive treatment for follicular lymphoma, a slow-growing blood cancer. Despite the strict regimen, he was only getting sicker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff's oncologist didn't understand it and sent the then 54-year-old to Dr. Mrinal Gounder at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Wolff underwent another biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test found that Wolff had an extremely rare, aggressive blood cancer called histiocytic sarcoma. Only about 300 patients are diagnosed with the condition each year in the U.S. Gounder, an oncologist who focuses on treating sarcomas, said the lymphoma that Wolff was being treated for earlier may have led to the development of the riskier cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff said that Gounder told him he had only treated about 10 cases of the disease before. Wolff didn't want to ask what had happened to those patients. Soon, he was given his prognosis: Gounder estimated Wolff had two months to live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was 10 years ago. Now, Wolff is considered cured after technology that he said "seemed like science fiction" was used to find an effective treatment for the rare cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using genetic sequencing to find treatment options  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/cancer-breakthrough-genetic-sequencing-could-change-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Genetic sequencing&lt;/a&gt; is a process where the DNA that makes up a cancer tumor is analyzed for unique genetic mutations. Those changes can point researchers in the direction of possible treatments, said Dr. Shridar Ganesan, the director of NYU Langone's molecular oncology program and a physician–scientist who was not involved in Wolff's care.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a long while, the classification of cancer was kind of dominated by anatomy, by where the lump is, and how it looks like under the microscope," Ganesan said. "But we realize now that in addition to kind of rise and lumps, we have to also take into account the exact changes that make the cancer cells different than normal cells, because that, in many ways, is the clue to both telling us why these cells are misbehaving, and can give us insights into how to then specifically target the growth of these abnormal cells." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff was at the "edge of a cliff," Gounder said. So he put Wolff on another course of intensive chemotherapy, then began analyzing the sarcoma. The process took about six weeks. Wolff said the chemotherapy left him unable to sleep and beset with high fevers. Gounder said the treatment didn't do much to help. But by the time the chemotherapy course was complete, the genetic sequencing results had come back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed "six or seven potential roads" that could have been used for treatment, Gounder said. He and others at Memorial Sloan Kettering looked at all the options, then settled on a pill called Mekinist, which is most often used to treat melanomas. Gounder believed a mutation found in Wolff's cancer made the pill a good option. There had never been a case where the drug had been used to treat histiocytic sarcoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When he said 'I think I found something and I think we have a drug that can (treat you),' I said 'Well, what's the research?'" Wolff remembered. "He said 'You're the research.'" &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;"I'm just so thankful" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff began taking the new regimen. He was skeptical that a medication that "looked like a little sugar pill" could help him when chemotherapy had failed. Within two days, the chemotherapy side effects he was experiencing were gone. Ten days into the treatment, Gounder did a PET scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exam found an 80% reduction in Wolff's tumors. Wolff said he considered the results "a miracle." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was totally blown away that this thing could have any effect," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gounder said Wolff's improvement was a welcome surprise — and helped change the game for future patients. In 2018, he &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6062005/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published Wolff's case&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. Mekenist is now used to treat histiocytic sarcomas, and in 2022, the Food and Drug Administration also approved the use of another medication, Cotellic. The outcomes for patients are "night and day," Gounder said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Wolff's cancer has not returned, 10 years after he was given just months to live. He was able to stop taking the medication, and last summer, Gounder told him he didn't need to return for annual checkups. He still sees a hematologist, an interventional radiologist and a dermatologist to treat side effects from the chemotherapy courses, but he's been able to return to his career as a renowned jazz musician. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been able to record so much music and play so many concerts around the world," Wolff said. "Every time I do something like that, I'm just so thankful to be able to do it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's next for genetic sequencing? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wolff's case was 10 years ago, when genetic sequencing of cancers was in the early stages. Now, scientists can analyze a tumor's whole genome in a matter of days, Gounder said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganesan said the technology is being used more widely now, particularly in patients with advanced-stage cancers. In some cases, like Wolff's, doctors find a new use for an existing drug. In others, knowing the specific makeup of a cancer allows doctors to develop new treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As genetic sequencing is used more widely, scientists are also learning more about the "enormous diversity of cancers," Ganesan said. He hopes that eventually, many cancers can be treated or cured using options discovered by genetic sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Two people with the same organ-based cancer diagnosis may have very different diseases. This is giving us a chance to understand that, and also to understand the very specific treatments," Ganesan said. "In the old days, we used to give a therapy and say 'Oh, 30% respond, I wonder why?' Now, it starts to tease apart why patients respond to some therapies and not to others, and also define, build and craft specific treatments for individual patients."&lt;/p&gt;

They have the type of twin closeness I thought only existed in fiction—lots of time together, shared interests, communicating so much with only eye contact, and living in opposite halves of a duplex together. Adam is straight but his brother, “Kyle,” is gay. Because they’re so close, I also spend enormous amounts of time with Kyle and his boyfriend, “Nick.” I’m lucky that I really enjoy Kyle and Nick because it is a lot like I acquired another sibling and a close friend, as soon as I got serious with my boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;

She asked me point blank in person once, and when I denied it she left an accusing note on my car! I mentioned this as a weird experience to a friend, and she told me that there is absolutely gossip going around town about one or both of us being unfaithful because of the optics of the time spent together. I’m 32, we’re not in high school! Both Nick and I moved to this medium-sized commuter town about a year ago and met our boyfriends at that point, so we don’t know a lot of people here. I’m kind of at a loss about what to do. Do I just ignore it? My boyfriend advocates for this, but it feels weird. Go places as a group of four and hope it fades? I feel like I’m living out a bad sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;

I agree with your boyfriend that your best bet is to ignore what your friend told you about the rumors, and when it comes to in-person confrontations like the one you had with your neighbor, you can just say “you’re welcome.” If she asks what you’re talking about you can say “The story you made up about me is obviously captivating to you, and you didn’t even have to subscribe to a streaming service and watch reality TV to get it.”&lt;/p&gt;

She recently took on a great deal of extra work and stress when my sister suffered a stroke that left her severely physically disabled. As my sister, a successful physician before her stroke, has spent more time with my mom, she has become increasingly worried about my mom’s memory. Alzheimer’s sadly runs in our family and is something that my mother fears deeply. My sister wants me to speak to our mom about this, but I worry about adding to her stress/fear at an already unbearably hard time in her life. My sister struggles with speech, so it would be hard for her to have this conversation herself. Would it be appropriate to bring this up to my mom’s PCP (a close family friend, in addition to an excellent doctor)? I wonder if it would be easier on my mom if her PCP brought this up at her next appointment as something more routine, instead of something we have noticed lately. I guess, in general: When is it time for kids to start taking a more active role in parents’ health, and is it ever ok for us to speak directly to their healthcare professionals?&lt;/p&gt;

I really think our culture needs something similar to mark older adults’ transition into the stage of life in which other people will begin to handle stuff for them—a big party that celebrates the life they’ve lived so far and comes with an understanding that the moment has come for loved ones to take a bigger role in supporting them, helping with daily life, and managing healthcare decisions. Similar to how a bride and groom sign a marriage certificate at the reception, the guest of honor could sit at a nicely decorated table to finalize their power of attorney and healthcare proxy paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9x9v51200333575ognipz4n@published"&gt;In the absence of one clear moment in which responsibility shifts, the question you asked, “When is it time for kids to start taking an active role in parents’ health?” is always a really touchy and fraught one. No one wants to offend an older adult by treating them as if they’re incompetent! But also, no one wants a loved one to suffer because they are in fact less up to the task of managing their own health than they once were. And it all happens under a cloud of anxiety about death, so conversations about this are even harder to think about and tempting to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9x9v51300343575zetwowdf@published"&gt;Your mom is on the young side for any of these issues, but the family history of Alzheimer’s makes your concerns very real. I assume she’s spoken openly about her fears about memory issues. One approach could be to say, “Mom, I know you’ve always been worried about Alzheimer’s because of what [x relative] went through. There are some good medications these days, so let’s talk to your doctor about whether some of the forgetfulness you’ve been dealing with is just normal aging, or whether it’s something we can start treating as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

She told us that her husband of 30 years is a narcissist and has been cheating on her since day one of her marriage. We have known for years that he is an alcoholic, and he is a lovable guy that my husband gets along well with. She tells us he sleeps with other women and other men, and that he tracks her car, her messages, everything. She says he’s taken out multiple mortgages on the house without her knowledge and all the finances are kept secret. She has no evidence to back any of this up and all she wants is to be believed and be heard. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/friend-terrible-marriage-dear-prudence-advice.html"&gt;Against my better judgment, I’m asked to believe her. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He was struck by how cruel the disease seemed, how it could crush the lives of young patients.

Millions of people worldwide are on the drugs, the first line of which were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And relapsing MS “is now in the rearview mirror,” said Hauser, a neuro-immunologist and head of UCSF’s Weill Institute for Neurosciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;‘A poster child for what is possible’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, Hauser said, demonstrates the immense time, effort and expense it takes to understand complicated human diseases and develop effective treatments — but also how the investment can have profound effects on human lives. He noted that in the current political climate, and especially given &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/california/article/trump-research-grants-college-20290739.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;cuts to federal funding for medical research&lt;/a&gt;, it’s more important than ever to celebrate clinical successes and support the careers of future doctor-scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When biomedical research is perceived to be threatened, great young people can conclude that this just isn’t a secure career,” Hauser said. “And yet we are entering a new era where these brain diseases are understandable, treatable and down the road even preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Multiple sclerosis is in many ways a poster child for what is possible,” Hauser said. “We all want a world free of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s and ALS and stroke. And autism and psychosis and depression. But to make this happen, we need to nurture the next generation of young people, and they really need encouragement because it’s a very difficult path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hauser’s entire career centered around this work, and he’s partnered with dozens of other scientists around the world to chip at the solutions. Developing the drugs that have changed the course of MS cost more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Hauser, 75, won the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, which included a $3 million award. He shared his award with a Harvard scientist who has identified a viral infection as an important risk factor for MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prizes were created 14 years ago by a team of philanthropists led by Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and Dr. Priscilla Chan. Hauser was named for his work in identifying B cells as the driver of most of the damage caused by MS, which for years was considered a dangerous theory, and for leading the effort to develop new therapies targeting B cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hauser “overturned the scientific consensus on the mechanism of MS, identifying the immune system’s B cells as the primary driver of damage to nerve cells,” according to the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, which delivered the award. His work developing therapies has “revolutionized modern treatment of the disease,” the foundation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Autoimmune condition affects millions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis affects about half a million people in the United States and millions more worldwide. It’s an autoimmune condition in which immune cells attack the body’s nervous system — specifically, the myelin, or insulation, that surrounds nerve cells and allows them to communicate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disrupting cellular communication can lead to cellular death and a variety of health issues, from numbness or pain in the arms and legs to vision problems, muscle weakness and fatigue. Patients may struggle with fine motor skills like buttoning a shirt or holding a paintbrush, or MS could cause brain fog or memory gaps. Some patients must use a wheelchair. Symptoms often are unpredictable and come on suddenly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 85% of MS patients have the relapsing form, which involves periodic flare-ups followed by stretches of recovery. The remaining patients have progressive MS, which worsens over time. The drugs Hauser developed may alleviate all symptoms in people with relapsing MS and can improve symptoms for people with the progressive form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They reduce inflammation by 99%,” Hauser said. “People on these drugs for relapsing MS have less than one attack per lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hauser entered the field of MS research in the late 1970s, there were no treatments and the disease was poorly understood. Scientists knew it was caused by inflammation, but they were just beginning to learn what triggered the inflammation. Work out of Europe pointed to patients’ own immune systems, and Hauser decided to test that by treating patients in the U.S. with strong chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He published his first report in 1984: The results were bittersweet. Hauser’s work supported the concept that MS was an autoimmune disorder, which was an important finding. And patients’ symptoms were controlled while they were on chemotherapy, but they resurfaced after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was devastated by this, but my patients were happy,” Hauser said. “They welcomed their time free of the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key focus on B cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, Hauser decided to focus on developing an accurate model that would replicate the human disease in marmosets, a squirrel-like monkey. For years scientists had been working with mouse models that didn’t mirror the human experience of disease very well, leading to some missteps and barriers in the search for drug therapies. Most notably, mouse models had identified T cells as the immune cell culprits, but Hauser and others were convinced B cells were the main villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once he had a solid disease model, Hauser and his team were able to get a better image of how MS damaged nerve cells and identify potential drug targets. Then in the 1990s, biotech firm Genentech developed the first antibody designed to target B cells. It was used to treat a form of cancer, but Hauser wanted to try this antibody on people with MS, which could both prove that B cells were involved and demonstrate whether killing them would improve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a tough sell. The National Institutes of Health, which had supported earlier research by Hauser, refused to fund this work because it was “biologically implausible,” Hauser recalled. Genentech models gave the antibody drug a 15% chance of success. The company would fund only a very small, very short trial of a low dose that would essentially test if the drug had any effect at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was our only shot on goal — to understand if removing B cells could help patients,” Hauser said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So tensions were high when they finally got the results. Hauser remembers the exact day: Aug. 26, 2006. “It was a gorgeous Friday afternoon in the Bay Area,” he said, “and we saw the best possible results.” Brain lesions, a telltale sign of MS, were reduced 90%; patients reported 50% fewer flare-ups. His partner at Genentech broke down in tears of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first trial used a chemotherapy drug, so Hauser and his team next worked to develop the same antibody therapy but better suited to MS patients. In 2017, the FDA approved ocrelizumab, the first in a new class of therapies for MS. Millions of people are now on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:mx0 x100vw sm:x100 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landscape architect Sarah Warto, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at age 20, tends to a plant in her backyard in San Carlos. Since she began taking the drug ocrelizumab, developed by UCSF doctor Stephen Hauser and his team, she has been essentially symptom-free for almost seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stephen Lam/S.F.

Her symptoms at first were alarming, but mild: tingling in her hands, strange sensations in her torso, a leg that would stubbornly drag when she walked. The treatment also was cumbersome: She had to give herself injections three times a week, of a drug that had to constantly be kept cold. It wasn’t an easy regimen for an active woman in her 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Warto managed until she had her first child in 2014. Shortly after her daughter was born, Warto’s symptoms worsened. Her legs became so unsteady she feared she would stumble and drop the baby. She would get fatigued after walking just one block or up the stairs to her third-floor walk-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a baby and seeing my own limitations, for the first time MS scared me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warto was under Hauser’s care by then, so she knew he was studying a potentially exciting new therapy. She decided to put off having a second child until 2018, when she knew she could take ocrelizumab, which was still considered experimental. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The second baby was night and day,” Warto said. Her symptoms never fully returned after she started the therapy, which she now gets twice a year via an infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warto has been essentially symptom-free for almost seven years. Her leg will sometimes drag after a workout or if she gets overheated, but otherwise she has no issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I almost feel like a fraud,” Warto said with a laugh. “If I mention to somebody that I have MS, they get this doom-and-gloom look. And I have to reframe that it is not my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The therapy is not a cure, and there remain many challenges in treating multiple sclerosis, including finding durable treatments for people with the progressive form. Scientists are identifying the earliest markers of the disease, in hopes that someday soon they will be able to prevent it entirely. They’re also looking at therapies to undo the damage caused by MS to those who have been living with it for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never thought I’d still be in the trenches at 75,” Hauser said with a chuckle. “But this is all too exciting and too important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 11:11:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQa29JV2Yxd2tiWUsyYXJZREMtSEd0bnhQc1M3QTlQcWhnRDVDVTQtcDRNR19ZTkdvMVVJRkVyX1FWbFowU0lxRTM5aDhaZ2o2ck5McmtNTm1ZdHNWMkdDWWdETURkb1c1aVFKdm1KZ193cGk0cmZBV3lPM2VPdk9JWk5zSXhYTDY0MGc</guid></item><item><title>这些老龄化专家，现在是老年人自己，对事情的看法不同-《华盛顿邮报》 | These experts on aging, now seniors themselves, see things differently - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOb2FZYWdBdDhMV3FxSFpSMmRkZkdrQ29jQWtHMDRjY3loWUhCcDY1XzQ4Vm01cWYxVVFZSkE0U3dTeXVYcFdmaGpBWE9OWDZPTFA3TE5ZWG5heUd4NXU1MWJSTVZlMlplT183N09iX3RoYUhsUjI1VGNNWVl4eE5LODJEYmVHNTVGRmdpWmJRWEhlQTFSNldDUlhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LIVGLWUSJJCWZJ5MVKNM3WKBOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a social worker for older adults, Robyn Golden, 67, preached the importance of staying active as you age.

But she didn’t realize how hard it could be for an older person. Last year, for example, she took up pickleball. She wasn’t expecting to play professionally, but she assumed she would improve alongside the younger students in the class she joined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWYCVHRJ25EXBPTPN5VIM6GV6Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When she didn’t, she started to think about quitting. “I’m in this class and all these people are progressing and I’m not,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EAFY44OW5VDW3G5RORLWH4AJNQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A conversation with a friend changed her mind. “I realized, they’re all thirty-some years younger,” she said. “I hadn’t even thought of that.” Golden, now associate vice president of social work and community health at Chicago’s Rush University, stuck out the class, and she still plays every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="URFN4J43UFDNPK57X2P7MPMG64" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That is an experience echoed by other social workers, professors and researchers who study aging in America.

What brought them joy, even as they lost partners and suffered physical setbacks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2XDSKQAMCVDWHKYKQPLZLTDN5A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Her conclusion: People with a project or a passion they were pursuing were in much better mental and physical shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SYA3HRAFXFDPPHWX5XTWBN23CM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“They were climbing huge mountains, doing things they’d never done before,” she said.

So it’s not surprising that he gets asked one question over and over: What’s the best way to grow old?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UGPM75AAP5HUXNG6GS4SLFW2BY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When he was younger, the Baltimore-based doctor had a set of standard health recommendations for older people: exercise and eat well, though no need to avoid the occasional glass of wine or dessert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CM6YIQYMDNG2FMWCJUOUFBL6JU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But as he has eased into senior citizenship, Leff saw greater nuance. “As you get older, you understand different aspects of life,” Leff said. “You’ve had your own experiences, you’re more empathetic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JZSM77XV7FGVVC4RYSBIUPE5TQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Resilience, Leff said, is a popular term among doctors, who urge their patients to stay tough through discomfort or unpleasantness until things return to normal. Now he’s come to see adaptation — adjusting and accepting what life throws your way — as equally important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U5K4CYPIUFED3ONYOWJL2HQSBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many of his patients are struggling with life-changing events, such as the death of a spouse, a cancer diagnosis or even retirement. Though many go through a period of “feeling a bit lost,” he said, “the vast, vast, vast majority of people find their way to seeking happiness and purpose and meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KJYZTUSHRVCFHODB6X3MOOIW44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ellen Langer, a 78-year-old Harvard University psychology professor, who studies the connection between mind and body, says that viewing aging positively — and focusing on what you are able to do, not what you can’t — can improve your health and mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTU4U6ALBFCRXD4ZWFMJ44MCYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Much of the research she does has focused on how to stay happy through old age. In one &lt;a href="https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2010/08/the-mindfulness-chronicles" target="_blank"&gt;well-known experiment, &lt;/a&gt;eight septuagenarians were briefly moved into a facility that had been meticulously styled to resemble the world as the subjects knew it 20 years ago. They were all encouraged to live as if they were their younger selves. After the experiment ended, Langer found that many of the subjects had improved vision and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JS555UJAWZFE5LJ6FLKDOQUQP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As Langer has gotten older, she hasn’t suffered the same discontents as many of her peers because she said she avoids the negative thinking about aging that traps other people. “I don’t walk around experiencing my age,” she said. “Age is not a relevant dimension to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NL4ELG4BXNDYFM6QV27756QIOE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t get discouraged — and don’t be too hard on yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="M2Y6HCOTWBGZDMBBUQXXYVOCBY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Michael Schuchert, a 54-year-old personal trainer who primarily works with older clients at DeHenzel Training Systems in northern Virginia and D.C., always knew the importance of being fit, but he only became interested in training after a running injury pushed him into physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5RM6PPDRKBCU5EKBGBEVK56C5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Schuchert realized that he needed to adjust his routine to his changing body. His clients, who range in age from their 40s to 80s, do as well. Some are interested in building upper-body strength so that they can pick up their grandchildren. Another wanted to improve her balance after a bicycle accident caused some neurological issues. One recent milestone: She was able to put on her pants while balancing on one leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGGZQFFIF5AMBKYG7CYXVCGDFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“As I’ve aged, I’ve started to feel more aches and pains,” Schuchert said. He finds his body is a little more delicate now, and it takes longer to recovery from injuries. “I need that core [muscle] … because I still have 25, 30-plus years ahead of me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2ODEUZZ6C5EXXN5O3QXUZ7HJCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Golden said that as a younger social worker, she didn’t always see the appeal of shared senior living, with its exercise classes and group activities. But now she finds the idea of a comfortable living space much more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VYNNZKVXKRF7HFTMIO6QWLNXBE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This taught her to focus closely on the interests of her patients, even if she didn’t connect to their desires. “We can’t put people in boxes,” she said. “I think that’s what I’ve learned.” She’s trying to do the same for herself, even as she continues to think about new hobbies, such as mastering a musical instrument, and traveling more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRRQKYYJ3VF7LIXI5RJ6IO6UHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I always assumed I have to learn to play cards,” at some point, she said, because that’s what the older people she knew did. And while researchers have also found that playing cards or other games regularly can improve brain health, Golden now realizes it may not be for her. “Maybe I’ll try it,” she said. “But maybe not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 11:01:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOb2FZYWdBdDhMV3FxSFpSMmRkZkdrQ29jQWtHMDRjY3loWUhCcDY1XzQ4Vm01cWYxVVFZSkE0U3dTeXVYcFdmaGpBWE9OWDZPTFA3TE5ZWG5heUd4NXU1MWJSTVZlMlplT183N09iX3RoYUhsUjI1VGNNWVl4eE5LODJEYmVHNTVGRmdpWmJRWEhlQTFSNldDUlhR</guid></item><item><title>您有“幽灵大便”吗？以下是关于您健康的信息。- HuffPost | Do You Have 'Ghost Poops'?

Here’s what causes ghost poops — and what they say about your overall health:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes a bowel movement a ‘ghost poop’?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you take a look at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pediatricsurgery.stanford.edu/Conditions/BowelManagement/bristol-stool-form-scale.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Bristol Stool Scale" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pediatricsurgery.stanford.edu/Conditions/BowelManagement/bristol-stool-form-scale.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bristol Stool Scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a visual chart that classifies bowel movements, ghost poops qualify as a Type 4 poo, Barten said. Though there may be no evidence left in the pot, your poop might look like a piece of sausage that’s smooth and soft. “I would consider that to be an absolutely perfect poop,” Barten said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ira-leeds/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Ira Leeds" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/ira-leeds/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Ira Leeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a Yale Medicine colorectal surgeon, said ghost poops — or nirvana poops, as he calls them — easily (but noticeably) pass through the anal canal, sink to the bottom of the toilet, and leave no residue when wiping. These three factors are indicative of good bowel health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A bowel movement that easily moves through the anal canal typically has an ideal consistency, according to Leeds. As such, you don’t have to push as hard. This, in turn, minimizes straining and toilet time, which can both lead to complications like hemorrhoids and anal fissures, he explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Floating poops typically have a higher fat content, which causes them to stay on the surface of the water. But when your poop sinks? This suggests your digestion is functioning well. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fats, proteins and carbohydrates are being broken down properly into their constitutive parts that can be used by the body effectively,” Leeds said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, seeing a lot of residue on the toilet paper when wiping could mean you have an underlying health issue. According to Leeds, if you have to wipe at least three times, you may want to investigate. While your diet may be to blame (more on that below), excess wiping can occur if you have hemorrhoids, fissures, chronic itching, or an anal fistulae, Leeds noted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do to ensure you have ghost poops?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are multiple factors that can impact the consistency of your poop such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622001924?via=ihub#s0085" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="diet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622001924?via=ihub#s0085" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;diet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, your &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4202343/#:~:text=Evidence%20from%20clinical%20and%20experimental,nervous%20system,%20peripheral%20neurons%20and" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="stress" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4202343/#:~:text=Evidence%20from%20clinical%20and%20experimental,nervous%20system,%20peripheral%20neurons%20and" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; levels along with how much you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9399653/#:~:text=After%20covariates%20adjustment,%20men%20with,CI:1.10%E2%80%932.29)." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="sleep" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9399653/#:~:text=After%20covariates%20adjustment,%20men%20with,CI:1.10%E2%80%932.29)." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and exercise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to improve your gut health, Barten recommended starting with dietary changes. In general, a high-fiber diet will bulk up your stool so that it looks like the Type 4 poo on that Bristol Stool Scale. Aim to consume 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-22_More_About_Carbs.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6767e4b01f53dc43f296" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-22_More_About_Carbs.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The more fiber you eat, the better your stool consistency will be, the easier it’ll be to go to the bathroom, and the less toilet paper you’ll need, Leeds said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many people have food sensitivities and intolerances. So, it’s worth being aware of how you react to various foods and drinks.

When you participate in an aerobic activity like pickleball, your body releases &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23040-endorphins#:~:text=Endorphins%20are%20chemicals%20(hormones)%20your,your%20sense%20of%20well-being." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="endorphins" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23040-endorphins#:~:text=Endorphins%20are%20chemicals%20(hormones)%20your,your%20sense%20of%20well-being." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;endorphins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or hormones that relieve pain, reduce stress, and boost well-being. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Playing pickleball is also a fun and efficient way of meeting the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="recommended guidance for physical activity" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommended guidance for physical activity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise a week). Physical activity is known to improve quality of life and promote healthy aging, especially in older adults, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524938/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="evidence" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524938/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;evidence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; consistently shows. And, as the Apple report revealed, pickleball games last roughly 90 minutes on average, helping you knock out half the amount of weekly physical activity needed in just one session. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pickleball also gives people the opportunity to stay connected with friends and family or develop new relationships. When people join leagues, for example, they might form a new sense of community and belonging. Plus, it’s inclusive: You can play with people of all ages, skill levels and backgrounds. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Humans thrive when we experience connection, and pickleball allows us to bond with one another through an activity that also physically makes us feel good,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/29092" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Emily Hemendinger" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/29092" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Emily Hemendinger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an assistant professor in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="department of psychiatry" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/psychiatry" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;department of psychiatry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It can also provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment. “Playing a sport, such as pickleball, can give people a goal to work towards, whether it’s winning a game, meeting people, or improving one’s skills,” Hemendinger said. Winning, in particular, can lead to a sense of pride and accomplishment, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pickleball Keeps Your Brain Sharp, Too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another theory from MacRae as to why pickleball can be such a mood booster: playing pickleball outdoors may increase exposure to natural daylight. And the more natural light we’re exposed to, the better our sleep quality, activity levels, and overall quality of life are, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s not all. The game also requires people to pay attention and think quickly and strategically. If you get distracted, for example, you run the risk of getting hit in the face with the ball or letting down your partner. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exercise-can-boost-your-memory-and-thinking-skills" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Physical activities" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/exercise-can-boost-your-memory-and-thinking-skills" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physical activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that require strategic thinking promote cognitive functioning, which can help prevent &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8932955/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cognitive decline" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8932955/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “Some studies have even found that sports like pickleball and racket sports can improve memory and processing speed,” Hemendinger said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In short: pickleball not only works out your body, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racket-sports-serve-up-health-benefits-2017060911780" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="exercises your mind" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="680a6651e4b01f53dc43f142" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/racket-sports-serve-up-health-benefits-2017060911780" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;&lt;span&gt;exercises your mind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following this no-sugar meal plan for a week made a huge difference in my life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I experienced more energy, fewer sugar cravings and thought less about food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I enjoyed the recipes so much that some have made it into my weekly rotation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A few weeks ago, I decided to embark on a challenge: Following an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell&lt;/em&gt; meal plan for a week. I’m not much of a meal planner or prepper, but I aspire to be, and I liked the idea of following a curated menu. And I can honestly say I was surprised at some of the changes I experienced as far as my cravings and relationship with food in just that one week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/can-your-diet-ease-seasonal-allergies-11709305" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spring allergies&lt;/a&gt;, various food sensitivities and affinity for added sugar, a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-8612457" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;7-Day No-Sugar, Anti-Inflammatory Meal Plan&lt;/a&gt; seemed like just the thing. Over the course of a week, my husband and I tried new recipes and filled our fridge and bodies with healthy foods. The recipes were delicious and the portions were generous. Here are the biggest things that happened when I followed an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-experienced-sugar-withdrawalthen-stopped-craving-it-entirely"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Experienced Sugar Withdrawal…Then Stopped Craving It Entirely &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anyone who knows me knows that I have a sweet tooth, and a pretty big one at that. I look forward to having a bite of something sweet after a meal, and not just after dinner. Decreasing my added sugar intake has been a personal goal for a long time, but as an emotional eater who keeps sugary foods stocked in their house, I hadn’t made any real progress until my week following the meal plan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; True to its name, the no-sugar, anti-inflammatory meal plan does not include foods containing added sugars. The only sugars I consumed that week were naturally occurring; found in fruits, vegetables and unsweetened dairy. Instead of chocolate bars and cookies, I ate blueberries and kefir, beets, pears and sliced oranges. It was definitely a huge shift for me.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I noticed the change to my diet almost immediately, with some pretty intense headaches and brain fog on the first two days. Despite these challenges, I didn’t deviate from the meal plan. I continued to prepare and enjoy all the meals and snacks, but definitely felt a bit out of it at first. It wasn’t a fun feeling, but by day three of following the plan, I felt much better. And even more surprisingly, I find myself wanting a sugary bite after every meal less often now. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t get me wrong, I still enjoy my sugar-sweetened desserts. But now I do it more mindfully, paying attention to the texture and flavor, and savoring every bite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-had-more-energy-despite-spending-more-time-preparing-food"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Had More Energy, Despite Spending More Time Preparing Food &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I won’t sugarcoat it (ha!) The recipes in this meal plan are pretty involved, with some having lengthy ingredient lists and several steps to prepare. But since I like cooking, work from home and had help from my husband with preparing the meals, it was manageable. In fact, some of the recipes that I initially balked at due to their long ingredient lists have made it into my regular rotation of meals, snacks and sides. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only are these recipes delicious, but they’re also packed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292071/the-best-foods-to-eat-to-fight-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt; like dark leafy greens, legumes and nuts. Foods like spinach, kale, chickpeas and nuts deliver nutrients that helped me feel my best during that week.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite spending more time shopping for ingredients, cooking and washing dishes, I found that I had more energy during the week I followed the meal plan. I felt more rested when it was time to get up in the morning, and didn’t fall asleep on the couch after dinner—a common ritual that I had normalized. This seems a little obvious, especially now that I reflect on it, but I’m still amazed at how much of a difference a week made and how much better I felt with some tweaks to my diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-i-thought-about-food-less"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; I Thought About Food Less &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I’m the type of person who thinks about their next meal while they’re currently eating one. I love food, write about food and edit food articles for a living, so it’s on my mind a lot. But that wasn’t the case during the week I followed the meal plan. Not only was I more satisfied after meals, but I didn’t have any cravings or feel the need to mindlessly snack. And though it was a busy and moderately stressful week for me, I wasn’t inclined to unwind with a glass of wine or a sweet bite. My relationship with food is complicated, and I’m still working on it, but I definitely felt a lot less anxiety about food and eating while following the meal plan. And with a meal and snack plan in place and my fridge and pantry stocked with all the necessary ingredients, it was a lot easier to adhere to a specific eating pattern.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to be dramatic, but this meal plan changed my life. Though I didn’t make every single recipe, filling my fridge with fresh fruits and vegetables and taking a break from added sugar made a difference in so many aspects of my life in just one short week. I’m less interested in foods packed with added sugar, have more energy and overall less obsessive about food. It’s been a few weeks since I followed this meal plan, yet recipes like the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250486/chickpea-potato-hash/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chickpea &amp;amp; Potato Hash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/277838/feta-kale-pear-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Feta, Kale &amp;amp; Pear Salad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/258084/peanut-butter-oat-energy-balls/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Peanut Butter-Oat Energy Balls&lt;/a&gt; have made it into my weekly rotation.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber is crucial for reducing colorectal cancer risk by keeping the digestive tract moving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Short-chain fatty acids from fiber fermentation may protect against colorectal cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To lower your risk, eat more plant-based foods, stay active and limit alcohol and processed meats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Colorectal cancer, frequently referred to as colon or rectum cancer, is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Approximately 4% of adults will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime, with an estimated 154,270 individuals likely to be diagnosed in 2025 alone, according to the Colorectal Cancer Alliance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some risk factors for colorectal cancer can’t be changed, like your age, sex, genetics and personal or family history of colorectal polyps or colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, your diet is a key risk factor that you do have control over. In fact, registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://karencollinsnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Karen Collins, M.S., RDN, CDN, FAND,&lt;/a&gt; nutrition advisor to the American Institute for Cancer Research, says, “Colorectal cancer is considered one of the cancers most influenced by diet and lifestyle. Our daily choices make a difference!” While your overall eating pattern makes the biggest difference when it comes to colorectal cancer risk, fiber is the most important nutrient for minimizing your risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber is truly a powerhouse when it comes to helping to protect your colon,” says board-certified oncology dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.wholesomellc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alison Tierney, M.S., RD, CSO&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Wholesome LLC. In this article, dietitians explain why fiber is the No. 1 nutrient to help reduce your risk of colorectal cancer and share other strategies for prevention.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that both &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by keeping food moving through your digestive tract.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Soluble fiber softens stools, making them easier to pass, while insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool and draws water into your colon to keep things moving. Besides making your bathroom visits more pleasant, staying regular may also help prevent colorectal cancer by reducing the amount of time colon cells are exposed to potential cancer-promoting compounds that may be in your stool. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tierney puts it more simply: “This means less time for harmful substances to hang around and potentially damage the cells lining your colon.” For optimal benefits, aim to eat a variety of fiber-rich foods, like whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables, throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike many nutrients, fiber isn’t digestible. Instead, it gets fermented by bacteria in the gut, producing short-chain fatty acids, like butyrate, which offer some pretty impressive health benefits. Emerging research suggests that these short-chain fatty acids may help protect against (and possibly slow down the progression of) colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Short-chain fatty acids [may] protect colorectal cells from damage [by] reducing markers of inflammation and showing effects on gene expression that could reduce cancer development,” says Collins.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Short-chain fatty acids may also help reduce overweight and obesity—additional risk factors for colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one study, people with type 2 diabetes have a 47% increased risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While the exact mechanism is unclear, it’s thought that this higher risk is due to higher levels of insulin in people with diabetes. There are many contributing factors to diabetes. However, a high-fiber diet may be protective by improving &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-insulin-resistance-8400321" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;—a condition that, over time, can lead to type 2 diabetes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eating more fiber usually means you’re eating more whole plant foods—like fruits, veggies, beans and whole grains—which also come packed with antioxidants and cancer-fighting nutrients,” says Tierney. Research suggests that antioxidants in fiber components may be especially beneficial for colon health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Because they aren’t digested, these antioxidants make their way into the colon where they can help reduce inflammation and support intestinal health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-lower-your-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Lower Your Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more fiber is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to lowering your risk of colorectal cancer. “Rates of early-onset colorectal cancer (occurring in people under age 50) are rising, and risk is considered to be reduced by these same lifestyle factors as colorectal cancer that occurs in older adults,” says Collins. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few strategies for reducing your risk: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut Back on Processed and Red Meats: &lt;/strong&gt;Eating red or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-for-healthy-blood-pressure-11710466" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;processed meats&lt;/a&gt;, including bacon, deli meats and sausage, is linked with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The American Institute for Cancer Research recommends consuming no more than 12 to 18 ounces of unprocessed red meat (like beef, pork and lamb) per week and avoiding processed meats as much as possible.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Alcohol Consumption: &lt;/strong&gt;Collins explains that &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-8747903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; is converted in the body to acetaldehyde, a cancer-promoting compound that damages DNA and makes repairing this damage harder. If you choose to drink, Collins recommends doing so in moderation, meaning no more than one standard drink per day for women and no more than two for men. Better yet, swap the alcohol for a glass of milk! Thanks to its calcium content and naturally present short-chain fatty acids, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/colorectal-cancer-milk-study-8775172" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;cow’s milk&lt;/a&gt; may help protect against colorectal cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Moving: &lt;/strong&gt;Regular physical activity has numerous benefits for health, including helping to improve insulin sensitivity, reducing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and supporting digestive health—all of which play a role in colorectal cancer risk. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat More Plants. &lt;/strong&gt;While you don’t need to eat plant-based 100% of the time, Tierney says that eating more minimally processed, plant-based foods is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer. “Whole plant foods give you not just fiber, but also a wide range of nutrients that help reduce inflammation and support a healthy gut and immune system,” she says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight--1-2-post mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight mntl-block theme-1-2-post"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-spotlight__heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Top-Rated High-Fiber Recipes to Try&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The dietitians we spoke with unanimously agree that fiber is the No. 1 nutrient to eat more of to lower your risk of colorectal cancer. Fermentation of fiber in the gut leads to the production of short-chain fatty acids, which may have anticancer effects and support weight management. Fiber is also beneficial thanks to its positive effects on gut health, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cancer prevention, there’s no one magic nutrient or habit. Instead, your overall lifestyle will have the biggest impact. Staying physically active, limiting alcohol intake, prioritizing plant-based foods and eating less red meat and processed meats are key strategies for prevention. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The NHS states that eating a balanced diet and avoiding caffeine, spicy food, stress, dehydration, and lack of sleep can help with symptoms of atrial fibrillation. However, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16765-atrial-fibrillation-afib" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;medication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is the main form of treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla told Business Insider how he's changed his diet to improve his health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His aim was to up his consumption of plant-based foods, with lots of greens, and keeping protein and fiber in mind, which meant eating lots more whole foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla's diet has been almost entirely free from ultra-processed foods for 15 years, he said. However, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dietitian-wrote-book-ultra-processed-foods-eats-in-a-day-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;dietitians&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; have previously told BI that the average person doesn't need to worry about the occasional ultra-processed food in their diet if they're eating mostly whole foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It's been apparent to me that the overuse of additives, emulsifiers, and the habituation of this kind of food in our diet are responsible for a huge swath of ill health, and it goes beyond obesity," Aujla said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"This is the most important thing because it affects your gut, which affects inflammation. There is a very clear link between the ultra-processed diet that is so normalized and a number of different conditions that we see affecting people across the UK and beyond."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla describes his diet as "plant-focused" or "plant-forward," meaning 70-75% plant-based while including some fish (about 20% of his diet), meat, and dairy products. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-friendly-high-protein-fiber-foods-doctor-stocks-kitchen-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;&lt;span&gt;Staple foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Aujla's kitchen include nuts, seeds, tofu, and lentils.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aujla still eats foods that he enjoys, like pizza, but it'll be a high-quality pizza from a pizzeria rather than a fast-food chain. He'll pair it with a homemade broccoli salad with balsamic vinegar, rocket, and Parmesan shavings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I get greens in at every single meal," Aujla said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It’s a vexing question that is at the heart of why so many people find it so difficult to stick to a diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To get answers, one neuroscientist, Harvey J. Grill of the University of Pennsylvania, turned to rats and asked what would happen if he removed all of their brains except their brainstems. The brainstem controls basic functions like heart rate and breathing. But the animals could not smell, could not see, could not remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Would they know when they had consumed enough calories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To find out, Dr. Grill dripped liquid food into their mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“When they reached a stopping point, they allowed the food to drain out of their mouths,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Those studies, initiated decades ago, were a starting point for a body of research that has continually surprised scientists and driven home that how full animals feel has nothing to do with consciousness. The work has gained more relevance as scientists puzzle out how exactly the new drugs that cause weight loss, commonly called &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/17/health/weight-loss-drugs-obesity-ozempic-wegovy.html" title=""&gt;GLP-1s and including Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;, affect the brain’s eating-control systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The story that is emerging does not explain why some people get obese and others do not. Instead, it offers clues about what makes us start eating, and when we stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;While most of the studies were in rodents, it defies belief to think that humans are somehow different, said Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University in New York. Humans, he said, are subject to billions of years of evolution leading to elaborate neural pathways that control when to eat and when to stop eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A statistical analysis has found associations between exposure to air pollution and declining cognitive performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Air pollution includes exposure to airborne substances such as nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cutting air pollution could have several &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/health/t-47500765"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British studies have shed light on the health consequences of exposure to air pollution and the benefits of reducing airborne toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/majority-of-the-world-has-polluted-air-report/a-71884331"&gt;Air pollution is a global problem&lt;/a&gt; that has been shown to cause a range of health and environmental issues and is linked to increased rates of cancer, as well as heart, lung and reproductive problems. Research has &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/air-pollution-linked-to-15-million-deaths-per-year-study/a-70904590"&gt;connected it to 1.5 million deaths&lt;/a&gt; annually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contaminated air can also exacerbate existing health issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, an inquest listed air pollution &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/coroner-traces-london-girls-asthma-death-to-air-pollution/a-55976433"&gt;as the cause of death for a 9-year-old girl&lt;/a&gt; with asthma in Southeast London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/pollution/t-19225773"&gt;Pollutants&lt;/a&gt; may also drive declining &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/human-brain/t-66434775"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One recently published &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/80/5/glaf060/8082041" title="External link — study"&gt;study&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers from University College London has found a link between exposure to two common pollutants and below-average cognition among older Britons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among these toxins is nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas released by petrol-powered vehicles, industrial processes and fossil fuel burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other is fine particulate matter — also known as PM2.5 — a cover-all term used to describe many substances released by burning processes that are less than 2.5 micrometers wide, about the size of many bacterial cells such as &lt;em&gt;E.coli&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When controlling for geographic location and socioeconomic factors, the researchers found that the amount of ambient air pollution where a person lives is associated with lower levels of overall and executive brain function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though associations such as these do not strictly mean that higher air pollution causes lower brain function, the researchers are confident it would be proved by a more in-depth study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their confidence draws from the large dataset used for the research, known as the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, which consists of almost a quarter century of data on people older than 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We looked at the ongoing exposure, and we also knew the levels of cognitive function before. So we cannot be certain, but we're pretty confident that there is not just an association [between exposure and cognition]," said Paola Zaninotto, a medical and social statistician at UCL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="64010258" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/64010258_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Fumes emerge from chimneys at a Welsh liquefied natural gas terminal. "&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter result from burning fossil fuels, including in transport, industry and energy generation.&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: K. Fitzmaurice-Brown/blickwinkel/picture alliance&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Early study to shine light on brain impact&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zaninotto said the study was simply a first step toward finding a more definitive cause and effect. However, her multidisciplinary research group has drawn some initial conclusions from the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline could result from pollutants in the bloodstream affecting the areas of the temporal lobe, the section of the brain that processes sensory information, language, memory and emotions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research by other UCL medical specialists also found that NO2 and particulates hurt the functioning of the central nervous and circulatory systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The exposure really is contributing to increase the cognitive decline and that in time will lead to dementia, so we really need to start thinking about reversing this trend," Zaninotto said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not an easy trend to reverse. Even those with the lowest exposures to ambient pollution were still subject to levels above limits recommended by &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/who-air-pollution-causes-7-million-premature-deaths-a-year/a-59264198"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These set a limit of 5 micrograms per cubic meter. The minimum exposure in the English cohort was eight and though reductions have been observed since the start of the study in 2010, some groups were exposed to levels nearly three times the recommendation as recently as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are improvements, but, despite these improvements, I think we are really still a long way from protecting people's brain health," Zaninotto said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="66657154" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/66657154_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt='A street sign in London reads: "Transport for London Ultra low emission (ULEZ) Zone"'&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;London's clean air zones were found to save 37 million pounds annually in productivity costs&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: Yui Mok/empics/picture alliance&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;London transport measures show a way forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If transport pollution is a major source of ambient air pollution, some policy measures may show a path to at least easing the concentration of contaminants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" class="external-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2025.106994" title="External link — An analysis"&gt;An analysis&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;path d="M11.5 3.5 11.5 4.233C14.342 4.233 15.167 4.245 15.167 4.258L8.984 10.467 10.033 11.516C14.826 6.725 16.228 5.333 16.242 5.333L16.267 9 17.733 9 17.733 2.767 11.5 2.767 11.5 3.5M2.267 11 2.267 17.233 16.733 17.233 16.733 12 15.267 12 15.25 15.75 9.5 15.75 3.75 15.75 3.75 6.25 9.5 6.233 9.5 4.767 2.267 4.767 2.267 11 "&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by a pair of UK-based economists found that policies introduced in London to create "low emission zones" have been effective at cutting pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result has been an improvement in several health-related economic factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Low (LEZ) and &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/london-expands-ulez-toll-zone-for-polluting-vehicles/a-66656932"&gt;Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ)&lt;/a&gt; policies introduced for central London in the past two decades were credited with reducing NO2 levels by 21%, while coarse particulates were cut by 15%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led to improvements in the number of Londoners taking sick leave, and a 10% cut to respiratory problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ULEZ is one of the strictest emission regulations in the world, but other nations, including several in Europe, as well as major Asian capitals such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Hanoi, have introduced similar controls on vehicle emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though vehicles aren't the only sources of air pollution, they are major drivers close to where people live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Eleonora Fichera, an applied economist at the UK's University of Bath, said the connection between health outcomes and economic benefits wasn't surprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"But the size of the effect is quite striking," Fichera said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, Fichera's study attributed £37 million (€43.4 million) in annual savings to the combined benefits of the policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"[Low emissions zones] are a very quick way to bring down pollution and it has short-term effects and long-term effects," Fichera said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We find reductions in particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide translate into productivity improvements, well-being and the mechanisms potentially [lead to] improvements in physical health," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, it’s a given that chatbots and other AI developments are going to fray our social fabric. Chatbots directly compete with &lt;a href="https://ai.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/AIoa2400802"&gt;therapists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://firstthings.com/the-defrocking-of-father-ai/"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/podcasts/the-daily/ai-chatgpt-boyfriend-relationship.html"&gt;romantic partners&lt;/a&gt; as a way to feel “seen” and receive guidance from someone who “cares.” There’s nothing the bots remind me of so much as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22944-pica"&gt;pica&lt;/a&gt;—the disorder where, lacking a necessary nutrient like iron, a person turns to compulsively eating a non-food, like paper or dirt. The hunger is real, the remedy is empty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re at the beginning of an AI boom, and the most obvious social threat is that the tech will directly exploit our hunger for personal connection while sapping our desire to connect to real people. But there’s another, subtler threat to our society. When technology takes off fast, amity between the sexes can collapse. Societies struggle when men and women’s preferences and practices diverge without having time to reanneal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claudia Golden, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, recently took a closer look at why some of the countries that kept up their fertility through the 1980s and even the 1990s have some of the lowest fertility rates in the world today. In her December 2024 analysis, “&lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w33311"&gt;Babies and the Macroeconomy&lt;/a&gt;,” what distinguished nations like Greece, Japan, Korea, and Spain was “rapid growth in GNP per capita after a long period of stagnation or decline.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the people of these countries were like time travelers, catapulted into a prosperous but alien future by a period of hyper-rapid modernization. Think of it as a version of the college student who comes back for their first Thanksgiving, on steroids. Suddenly, the rising generations of millennials and Gen Z are living in a world very different from that of their parents, and they may feel like their parents haven’t even noticed. The advice your mother and father gave you in good faith may be a terrible match for your present circumstances (as is the case today, when parents assume their child can apply to just a few colleges or drop off some resumes and expect an acceptance or job offer). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moments where parents’ ways of living are obviously and jarringly miscalibrated to the world erode the trust across generations. And a few obvious failures can lead children to reject former ways of thinking wholesale, rather than sifting their parents’ experience and traditions to see what still holds true. In Golden’s analysis, “It is the speed with which tradition-bound people are catapulted into modernity that gives generations little time to adapt and brings old ways into sudden conflict with the new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men and women tend to experience these economic and technological accelerations differently. The younger generation isn’t just growing away from their parents—young men and women are diverging from each other. In the countries Golden studied, men have a greater attachment to past traditions than women on average, and this puts the sexes out of sync. For the nations that Golden analyzed, a major point of sex-based divergence was women entering the workforce. But she was careful to note that it wasn’t women working, specifically, that collapsed childbearing. In fact, she observed a U-shaped curve, where countries with very high or very low female employment had higher fertility rates than those with a moderate amount of women working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the high female employment countries changed slowly, and eventually settled into a relatively stable equilibrium. Women couldn’t “have it all,” but there were shared, better expectations for how to balance work and family life. Men and women came to agreement about how to reset expectations for the home to make family life sustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I term this a generational conflict because it derives from men’s greater attachment to the past,” Golden writes. “But it becomes a gendered conflict when the husband’s desire for more children exceeds that of the wife’s, and when they must find a solution. When nations develop more continuously and across a longer time frame, less generational conflict arises and the fertility desires of men and women are more similar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Golden saw in the low part of the U was women who were entering the workforce, but also expected to do everything they previously did at home. The old script didn’t match their new workload. When something had to be abandoned, it was generally the children they might have had. Not only does this decrease the fertility rate, it eats away at amity between the sexes, as husband and wife both feel like the other has broken faith—husbands feel cheated &lt;a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/10310949/men-want-children-more-than-women-parenthood-us-study/#:~:text=Parenthood%20can%20be%20a%20difficult,want%20children%20more%20than%20women"&gt;of children&lt;/a&gt; they may have expected, and wives feel cheated of a more harmonious domestic arrangement. When young men and women observe this mistrust in the marriages of their peers, they may decide to avoid the institution entirely. Indeed, in America, a large degree of our own fertility drop is driven by fewer people getting married, not by married couples having fewer children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;America has the advantage of already being on the high side of the U, with higher female labor participation &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; higher fertility than many of our peer nations. However, family sizes are still smaller than Americans say they want, and &lt;a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/no-ring-no-baby"&gt;marriages are later and rarer than for prior generations.&lt;/a&gt; The question is what will break &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; when technology and employment change quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, amid the economic disruption of President Trump’s worldwide tariffs, a brewing gender enmity has erupted even more into mainstream discussions. A small but noisy subset of men cheer for tariffs and government layoffs explicitly as a way of destabilizing the “email jobs” &lt;a href="https://www.cartoonshateher.com/p/doge-is-about-sex"&gt;they believe have left women too independent of men&lt;/a&gt;. These men feel they were handed a cultural script for dating and marriage that relied on them being a breadwinner—and they don’t know how to win a woman in the absence of being economically necessary to her. Their anger echoes the generation and gender divisions that Golden identified—if you’re doing everything &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; according to the rules you were given, you must be being cheated by someone who broke the game.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that game is becoming more complicated. With AI programs able to manage entry-level tasks &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; high level math challenges, some companies are &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/klarna-hiring-freeze-chatgpt-ai-job-replacement"&gt;already applying hiring freezes&lt;/a&gt;—and that’s the kind of technological leap forward that creates sharp divisions between winners and losers. The challenge we should prepare for is massive disruptions to industries and entry-level work which upend men and women’s plans for their own careers. A big change to the nature of work is likely to also accelerate the obsolescence of social scripts—and in particular, men and women meeting each other with even less confidence that they are operating within a set of shared expectations. And the less men and women know about how their career and timeline for children will unfold, the harder it is for them to find a compatible partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some ways that America is likely to be more resilient under this strain than the relatively culturally homogenous countries Golden examines. Americans already live in a pluralistic society, learning to code-switch, to navigate unfamiliar norms, to consider whether to convert to an alternate cultural cohort. We already do not expect bedrock under our feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the world of dating does not look like a flourishing social bazaar, with many different, intelligible traditions to choose between and cleave to. Instead, many of the ways men and women met their spouses have faded in favor of online dating. This can only be a thin tradition, and it shows its weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of courtship and sexual norms being set by the pooled practice of friends, parents, coworkers, etc.—people known to and respected by the prospective couples—the rules are set by the interface and algorithm designers at a company bent on maximizing time on devices. The people who set you up will not dance at your wedding, sign the ketubah, or stand as godparents to your firstborn.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The present moment is like the first warning of a tsunami—the bare sand elongating the beach as the water rushes out, soon to return in force. The time to seek higher ground is now, before the actual wave is in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way through the coming crisis is to be frank about the loss of cultural scripts we’ve already suffered, and to be curious about sifting the past to see what merits salvage. We should have a strong bias toward the human-mediated versus the machine-optimized, so that our longing for romantic connection depends on and strengthens friendship and family connections in its wake. Men and women need ways to come together for IRL projects, whether it’s romantic setups organized by friends or hosting a rotating dinner party. We need to prioritize the one-to-one or small group connections that allow for patience and forgiveness when advice doesn’t quite match the present moment. Adaptation has to be a collaborative project across the genders and the generations, not a moment of the young growing beyond the old or the sexes growing apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1k01t63/comment/mnaoaas/" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;: The conversations about vaccines rarely come up. I have tried to talk to them about it once in regard to my younger siblings. However, they are pretty resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the COVID-19 vaccine was rolling out, I tried to have a serious conversation with them about it, but it ended up in a big fight, which is not worth it to me. I think it's important to meet people where they're at and support them on their journey without being forceful because that can lead to more resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

And &lt;a class="link" href="https://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phcommon/public/media/mediapubdetail.cfm?unit=media&amp;amp;prog=media&amp;amp;ou=ph&amp;amp;prid=4971&amp;amp;keywords=measles&amp;amp;row=25&amp;amp;start=1" target="_blank"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, a case was reported in a non-L.A. County resident who arrived on a Korean Air flight from Seoul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The traveler was not infectious during the time of travel,” the county Department of Public Health said in a statement Friday regarding the most recent case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials are working to identify people who may have been exposed while the infected person was contagious with the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles include a high fever — above 101 degrees — cough, runny nose, red and watery eyes and a rash, which usually starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles spreads easily through the air and can remain airborne and on surfaces for hours, even after an infectious person has left the room. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can spread measles to others from four days before the disease’s telltale rash appears through four days afterward, according to the CDC. People who have not been immunized against measles, either through vaccination or prior infection, are at risk of getting sick between seven and 21 days after exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two doses of the measles vaccine are 97% effective against infection, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CDC officials have identified 10 measles outbreaks nationwide. The largest began in a close-knit community with low vaccination rates in Texas’ Gaines County, adjacent to New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That outbreak has since spread to New Mexico and Oklahoma, and is suspected to be linked to more cases in Kansas, the CDC report said. A growing outbreak in the Mexican state of Chihuahua was also reported after a resident fell ill after visiting Gaines County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this year, 884 measles cases have been reported nationwide, “the second-highest annual case count in 25 years,” according to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During all of 2024, 285 measles cases were reported nationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the cases reported so far this year, the median patient age was 8. About one-third of those infected were younger than 5, the report said. Among all measles patients, 96% were not vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, 85 measles patients this year have had to be hospitalized. Except for one, all of them were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Texas officials have said the cause of the state’s latest measles death was &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;measles pulmonary failure&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the measles cases reported so far nationally this year are tied to close-knit communities with low vaccination coverage, the CDC said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Friday’s announcement, nine measles cases had been reported in California this year, with cases also reported in Orange, Riverside, Fresno, San Mateo, Placer and Tuolumne counties, according to the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, California confirmed 15 cases of measles. In 2023, the total was only four. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-disneyland-measles-20150114-story.html"&gt;worst measles outbreak &lt;/a&gt;in recent memory occurred between December 2014 and April 2015. Centered at Disneyland, the outbreak resulted in about 131 Californians getting infected. People from six other states, Mexico and Canada were also sickened, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the California Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that outbreak, California lawmakers &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-measles-us-california-outbreak-vaccine-new-york-disneyland/" target="_blank"&gt;strengthened childhood vaccination&lt;/a&gt; requirements for schoolchildren. For the 2023-24 academic year, 96.2% of California’s kindergartners were vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s slightly down from the 96.5% seen the year prior. But it remains above the levels recorded before the Disneyland measles outbreak, which were less than 94%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say they aim for a 95% measles vaccination rate to guard against outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid the ongoing outbreaks, pediatricians have stepped up efforts to rebut misinformation about both the disease and the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The measles vaccine is safe and effective,” the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a recent &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-the-measles-vaccine-is-safe-and-effective/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, rebutting what they called “wellness influencers and anti-vaccine advocates” who they say “falsely assert” that getting vaccinated “is as dangerous as contracting measles itself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Extensive research demonstrates that the MMR vaccine is safe and significantly reduces the risk of contracting measles, a disease that can lead to severe complications and death,” the pediatrics group said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 01:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxNM0VvTGZYR1JzZ3QxbExHTkU1NE9wTTZxYVByeFNwSkg3Z0E4amJBUWFBdW1JNXBJdmVsSklIMVZmN3JuSnZabmFkaXpjWk5sMEVVYjdqcG9WSlpZZDdzQmdJNEY0aHd5RGtPdjRXaG1jbndMbW1DRE50dXVPWFNRT2kyOEN6U1NxTlFod0JOMnpqR0ViNTJtc2YzWUNhYjhpM2NONXYwSnN6TXJfOXBQZGZkcU9TOVNhMmdCY0RVcXBFQlk</guid></item><item><title>诉讼指控马里兰州糖尿病患者在服用Ozempic后失明- NBC新闻 | Lawsuit alleges Maryland man with diabetes became blind after taking Ozempic - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTG1hd05HdElPM21xUkc1OXlHaGxNUXRFV3A0U2YteHY1LU9qVnFkOE1IbzFQWW0ydFBRSVFVUGY0and6TUh5c0E3M0FSSXR6LXlGX2JCbWplbTB0VWpzN0ZrOXAwYmxCRzNQVktUc05ER0JXR2RLb1AyMndZNDEwWElmdDNOd3FjaUQxRzZTbUE3VWJLb1E5eHE5OGc4RmlLakd3VFNJUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A Maryland man who took Ozempic and then became legally blind is suing the drug’s manufacturer, arguing it had an obligation to warn patients that loss of sight could be a possible side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Todd Engel, 62, was prescribed Ozempic in 2023 to manage his Type 2 diabetes. The lawsuit said about four months later, Engel was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a condition in which a loss of blood flow to the optic nerve causes sudden and irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;NAION occurs in up to about 10 out of every 100,000 people over age 50, according &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/naion-diagnosis-and-management" target="_blank"&gt;to the American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Ozempic and others in the same class of drugs, called GLP-1s, were designed for Type 2 diabetes and have become wildly popular for weight loss in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-may-linked-condition-causes-blindness-research-needed-rcna159991" target="_blank"&gt;Some studies have indicated&lt;/a&gt; that patients prescribed semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, for diabetes or weight loss may be at &lt;a href="https://increased%20risk%20of%20developin/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk of developing NAION&lt;/a&gt;. Experts say while evidence is growing that there is an association between Ozempic and NAION, it’s still too early to know definitively if semaglutide raises the risk of developing the condition — especially because diabetes itself is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3786911/" target="_blank"&gt;a risk factor&lt;/a&gt; for NAION and &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticeyeproblems.html" target="_blank"&gt;other eye issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit, filed late Thursday in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Middlesex County, accuses Novo Nordisk of negligence and said it had a duty to provide patients and physicians with information about the risk of serious eye problems. It said Novo Nordisk had access to information dating back as early as its Ozempic clinical trials that identified cases of NAION yet chose not to list the condition on its warning label. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Nothing was or is stopping Defendant from adding a warning regarding the risk of NAION,” the lawsuit said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said NAION is not an adverse drug reaction to Ozempic and other GLP-1s. Novo Nordisk said its benefit-risk profile of semaglutide “remains unchanged” after a thorough evaluation of studies from the University of Southern Denmark and an internal safety assessment, which didn’t suggest a causal relationship between GLP-1 use and NAION.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The company added that it takes reports of adverse events seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“This also relates to eye conditions, which are well-known comorbidities for people living with diabetes. Any decision to start treatment with prescription-only medicines should be made in consultation with a healthcare professional who should do a benefit-risk evaluation for the patient in question, weighing up the benefits of treatment with the potential risks,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Jonathan Orent, an attorney for Engel who works for plaintiff litigation firm Motley Rice, said Engel first experienced loss of vision in one eye before eventually becoming legally blind in both. The eye problems forced him to resign from his job as a motor equipment operator for his county’s public works department, made it impossible for him to drive and have forever changed how he interacts with family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250425-ozempic-lawsuit-mn-0853-46937e.jpg" alt="Todd Engel and his wife, Shelley."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Todd Engel and his wife, Shelley.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Todd Engel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He made a comment to me about how it’s painful to know he’s never going to see his wife smile again, but he knows her voice so well, he can tell when she is smiling,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He said if Engel had known Ozempic had a possible link to blindness, he would have considered other treatment options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are a wide number of medications that can be used to treat diabetes, and treat it effectively,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit is not the first of its kind. Another law firm recently filed a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parker-waichman-llp-files-one-of-the-first-naion-eye-injury-cases-against-novo-nordisk-in-the-superior-court-of-new-jersey-middlesex-county-302429606.html" target="_blank"&gt;similar suit against Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The litigation comes amid ongoing questions over the link between the drug and NAION. A&lt;a href="https://%202024%20study/" target="_blank"&gt; 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found that people with diabetes who take semaglutide are over four times more likely to be diagnosed with NAION than people with diabetes who had not been prescribed it. Those who were overweight or obese and did not have diabetes were over seven times more likely to be diagnosed with NAION than those who had not been prescribed it, the study found. But the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ozempic-may-linked-condition-causes-blindness-research-needed-rcna159991" target="_blank"&gt;cautioned that more studies are needed&lt;/a&gt; to determine whether there is a causal link between the irreversible vision problems and the drugs, especially because it was a study based on an analysis of six years’ worth of medical records from patients in the Boston area, not a randomized clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In February, a JAMA Ophthalmology &lt;a href="https://study/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggested a more modest increase in the risk of NAION among people with Type 2 diabetes who take Ozempic, and also suggested further investigation was necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration declined to respond to questions about reports of a possible association between Ozempic and NAION, saying it does not comment on pending litigation. On the FDA’s Adverse Events Reporting System, a public dashboard, there are hundreds of reports from 2024 of eye disorders tied to Ozempic, though the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-public-dashboard" target="_blank"&gt;FDA warns the dashboard data&lt;/a&gt; may contain duplicates and the data has not been independently verified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Andrew Lee, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a neuro-ophthalmologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, said he is eager for more research to come out on semaglutide, particularly on whether it raises the risk for life-altering eye diseases such as NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a super important question to be able to answer whether Ozempic or any semaglutide causes NAION,” he said. “There’s just so many people on this drug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But patients who are concerned should not rush off the drug without speaking to their doctors, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“How many people would you harm if they weren’t on it because they got a stroke or a heart attack or got some other problem?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Engel’s lawsuit seeks damages and a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Hopefully his story will show that there’s another side to this drug that has bought the reputation as being a miracle drug,” Orent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPTG1hd05HdElPM21xUkc1OXlHaGxNUXRFV3A0U2YteHY1LU9qVnFkOE1IbzFQWW0ydFBRSVFVUGY0and6TUh5c0E3M0FSSXR6LXlGX2JCbWplbTB0VWpzN0ZrOXAwYmxCRzNQVktUc05ER0JXR2RLb1AyMndZNDEwWElmdDNOd3FjaUQxRzZTbUE3VWJLb1E5eHE5OGc4RmlLakd3VFNJUQ</guid></item><item><title>大规模研究将15个因素与早期痴呆风险联系起来- ScienceAlert | Massive Study Links 15 Factors to Early Dementia Risk - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQWDBMTEVrWmdlMUtPT2lJZDJ2WTN0TjJTeG9zdkJEMnhTbFJtZnZtMlVLdVluYWstdUZ1WjNfSENheHo3OGctVTNSalFIN2JkRzBFbC1oaDAxcU9wTXI5eDNaN3hfcmZHNkFVWEVGc1RrRW93ZTd5UV9HWHRITmZiU3VrYVlkanVhWEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;While dementia is much more common in older adults, hundreds of thousands of people are diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/young-onset-dementia"&gt;young-onset dementia&lt;/a&gt; (YOD) each year, and an extensive study published in 2023 sheds some considerable light on why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1533317514545825"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; in this area has looked at genetics passed down through generations, but here, the team was able to identify 15 different lifestyle and health factors that are associated with YOD risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the largest and most robust study of its kind ever conducted," &lt;a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/risk-of-young-onset-dementia-could-be-reduced-through-targeting-health-and-lifestyle-factors/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist David Llewellyn from the University of Exeter in the UK, when the results were published in December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Excitingly, for the first time it reveals that we may be able to take action to reduce risk of this debilitating condition, through targeting a range of different factors."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data collected on 356,052 people aged under 65 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149333" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149333" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Flowchart-of-Included-Participants.jpg" alt="Flowchart " class="size-full wp-image-149333" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Flowchart-of-Included-Participants.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/Flowchart-of-Included-Participants-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149333" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Flowchart of included participants.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="159293" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D deficiency and high levels of the C-reactive protein (produced by the liver in response to inflammation) also meant a higher risk, as did having two of the ApoE4 ε4 gene variants (a genetic scenario already &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-genetic-form-of-alzheimers-identified-in-people-with-common-risk-factor"&gt;linked to Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers described the relationship between alcohol and YOD as "complex".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_146115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg" alt="Different hands holding drinks" class="wp-image-146115 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-642x429.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/pexels-thongtran95-14448570-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-146115" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(Ketut Subiyanto/Pexels)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-easy-strategy-to-reduce-alcohol-intake-scientists-say"&gt;alcohol abuse&lt;/a&gt; led to an increased risk, moderate to heavy drinking correlated with a reduced risk – possibly because people in this second group are usually healthier in general (bear in mind that those who abstain from alcohol often do so on medical grounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/education-seems-to-protect-the-gut-not-just-make-you-smarter"&gt;formal education&lt;/a&gt; and lower physical frailty (measured through higher handgrip strength) were also associated with a lower YOD risk. This all helps to fill in some of the knowledge gaps around YOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We already knew from research on people who develop dementia at older age that there are a series of modifiable risk factors," &lt;a href="https://news.exeter.ac.uk/faculty-of-health-and-life-sciences/risk-of-young-onset-dementia-could-be-reduced-through-targeting-health-and-lifestyle-factors/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neuroepidemiologist Sebastian Köhler from Maastricht University in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In addition to physical factors, mental health also plays an important role, including avoiding chronic stress, loneliness, and depression."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results don't prove dementia is caused by these factors, they help build a more detailed picture. As always in this kind of research, knowing more about the causes can help develop better treatments and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-popular-new-weight-loss-drug-may-help-prevent-dementia"&gt;preventative measures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these factors are modifiable, which offers more hope for those working to find ways to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/bodybuilding-supplement-shown-to-stave-off-dementia-in-mice"&gt;beat dementia&lt;/a&gt; rather than just manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-group-of-people-might-benefit-from-taking-fish-oil-to-slow-alzheimers"&gt;may be something we can reduce the risk of&lt;/a&gt; by living healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149335" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149335" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/YoungCoupleRunningExerciseHealthy642.jpg" alt="A young couple running outdoors" class="size-medium wp-image-149335" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/YoungCoupleRunningExerciseHealthy642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/YoungCoupleRunningExerciseHealthy642-600x347.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149335" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;We may be able to reduce the risk of dementia by living healthier lives.

&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Colorado on Friday reported its fifth incidence of measles this year, and, for the first time in the spate of cases, the infection was in a person who had been vaccinated against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The person, an adult living in Denver, had recently traveled to the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which is seeing an outbreak of measles. Two other cases identified in Colorado — one in a baby in Denver and another in a Pueblo resident — were also connected to travel to Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment identified one location where people may have been exposed to the virus as a result of this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was at the Kaiser Permanente urgent care clinic at 8383 W. Alameda Ave. in Lakewood between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 19, should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days and consider avoiding public gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think you may be sick with measles, call ahead to your doctor’s office or emergency clinic before going in to allow the staff to make sure you can be seen without risk of exposing others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-about-breakthrough-measles-infections"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About “breakthrough” measles infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new case is unusual because it is in someone who has verified proof of MMR vaccination. But that doesn’t mean such a so-called &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/measles-breakthrough-cases-vaccination-important/story?id=120276354"&gt;breakthrough infection&lt;/a&gt; is unexpected, said Dr. Ned Calonge, CDPHE’s chief medical officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two doses of MMR vaccine are considered 97% effective at stopping an infection — one dose is considered 93% effective. That means on average three out of every 100 vaccinated people who are exposed to the virus will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When that happens, the illness is likely to be more mild, and that is exactly what occurred in the latest Colorado case, Calonge said. He said the infected person is reported to be feeling well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccinated people who develop an infection are also less infectious toward others, Calonge said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Calonge emphasized that this breakthrough infection does not mean the virus has mutated dangerously or become more adept at evading the immune system. Rather, he said, in rare cases people will not respond to the MMR vaccine or their immunity will wane over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-faster-notification"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster notification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While state officials are optimistic about the health system’s readiness to respond to measles infections, some of the earlier cases &lt;a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/04/24/denver-measles-case-public-health/"&gt;saw long delays&lt;/a&gt; in reporting suspected infections. That caused CDPHE to send out reminders to clinics and labs that possible measles cases need to be reported promptly to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

(National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, via Flickr)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest case, it took nearly a week from the time the person visited the clinic to when the public was told about the confirmed case of measles. But Calonge said the clinic did inform CDPHE right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delay in publicly reporting the infection was because health officials looked at the vaccination status of the person and weren’t certain the test result to confirm a measles infection would come back positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The decision was, based on the vaccination history, that the likelihood was low,” Calonge said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Calonge said anyone who has been tested for measles should isolate themselves until the test result comes back.&lt;/p&gt;

But just how healthy is it to drink orange juice every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to know all the facts about starting your day with a glass of OJ, so we got in touch with &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionnowcounseling.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker&lt;/a&gt;, R.D.N., and Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Raj Dasgupta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Raj Dasgupta&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Medical Advisor for Garage Gym Reviews. The bottom line? It's complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Orange juice does have some great perks—like being packed with vitamin C and antioxidants—but drinking it every day isn’t always the best idea," Dr. Dasgupta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Health Benefits Of Orange Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;mrs - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Orange juice is the darling of the immune health-supporting drinks, thanks to the vitamin C it provides," Manaker says. "But OJ is so much more than a vessel for this key nutrient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other key nutrients in orange juice are folate and thiamin. Some OJs are also fortified with vitamin D and calcium, which Manaker says might support bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since most Americans are not eating the recommended servings of fruits and veggies every day, OJ can help bridge the gap in an accessible and versatile way," she adds. So that's good news if you're an orange juice drinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Guillermo Murcia - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Potential Risks Of Orange Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing, though: Orange juice contains a lot of sugar. According to the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/169098/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;, an average 8-ounce serving has about 26 grams of carbohydrates and 20 grams of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juicing strips fruit of much of its fiber. A cup of orange juice has zero protein, &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/just-for-fun/high-protein-high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, or fat, which are nutrients that can help slow the absorption of sugar and prevent blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s easy to forget how much sugar is in even a small glass, and without the fiber you’d get from eating an orange, it can spike your blood sugar quickly," Dr. Dasgupta says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And according to Manaker, even natural sugars can contribute to increased caloric intake and potential weight gain if consumed in excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And due to its acidity, orange juice could make symptoms worse for anyone with acid reflux or gastritis. She also says people with diabetes or who are managing PCOS might experience elevated blood sugar when drinking &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food/orange-juice-espresso-drink/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:orange juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;orange juice&lt;/a&gt; by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For this population, drinking orange juice as they are enjoying a meal or snack that provides protein, fiber, and fat may be a better bet, assuming their healthcare provider approves of them drinking &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/fruit-juice-blends-apple-juice/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruit juice;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fruit juice&lt;/a&gt;," Manaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pasteurized Vs. Unpasteurized Orange Juice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also some food safety things to keep in mind when choosing your juice. Unpasteurized OJ is often favored for its fresh taste, but it comes with an increased risk of contamination from bacteria, Manaker says. Pasteurized orange juice undergoes a heat treatment that kills harmful bacteria, but some of the nutritional value and flavors can be lost in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasteurized orange juice has a longer shelf life, so if you decide to purchase unpasteurized juice, she said you should drink it shortly after it's made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And if you are making it at home, wash the outside of the orange before squeezing to help remove any bacteria that may be on the surface."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is it healthy to drink orange juice every day? This depends on several factors, such as your diet and health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a few reasons someone might want to skip orange juice," Dr. Dasgupta says. "If you’re watching your blood sugar, trying to cut back on sugar, or have acid reflux, it might do more harm than good."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If a person is relatively healthy and they are not eating enough servings of fruit every day (as most Americans are not), then a glass of OJ every day may be a good idea," Manaker says. "Just be mindful of serving sizes when drinking your juice!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 22:56:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE55RzlEeHZDMEo0M2NsakNYZXZHa09wd094dGlnNzNIbEw3MkF3VTg5dEJGbE9ONm9sZXBjZTFYdnFOWUZGMmlleHo5R3NhaFpWcDN0VUhWMHpJdWpJazBnLTROajdCclRqT25ra1JMNmdmNmNE</guid></item><item><title>具有严重症状的传染性病毒在密歇根州蔓延- 103.3 WKFR | Contagious Virus With Serious Symptoms Spreading In Michigan - 103.3 WKFR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT0FVX3lxTE9ReXU3UUNWZzBIczlkT0tQcFk5NnZlUXpWLXV3Y2xucGRadTc3eW5Qb2QxNmpGbHRVMWlfTjh1TkhvUnNnTGJzR1VYMWtVMmM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pod-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Michigan health officials have seen a decline in winter illnesses, such as flu, COVID-19, and RSV, one contagious virus with serious symptoms continues to spread in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Contagious Virus With Serious Symptoms Spreading In Michigan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/health/2025/04/25/whats-going-around-in-metro-detroit-spring-allergies-asthma-flare-ups-stomach-viruses/"&gt;health officials&lt;/a&gt;, April has brought in a wave of viruses in Michigan, typical for this time of year, seeing lots of patients with seasonal allergies and asthma. There's also been a sharp uptick in patients suffering from a norovirus-driven stomach bug as well. And cases of one contagious viral infection, which affects the salivary glands and causes painful swelling of the jaw, are rising in the Great Lakes state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks/index.html"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; has one of the highest rates of mumps in the U.S., as of April 25th. 11 cases of &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/-/media/Project/Websites/mdhhs/CDINFO/WSR/Current_WSR.pdf"&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in Michigan so far, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). The viral infection is spread through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets from an infected person. Michigan residents are warned to look for the following symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the symptoms include fever, headaches, muscle aches, loss of appetite, fatigue, and jaw pain. While most people recover within two weeks, serious complications can occur, including hearing loss and swelling of the brain. There is no treatment for mumps.

&lt;p&gt;The adult patient — Colorado’s fifth confirmed measles case this year — visited the Kaiser urgent care clinic at 8383 W. Alameda Ave. People who spent time in the clinic between 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. Saturday could have encountered the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other four cases in Colorado this year, the latest patient — who had visited an area of Chihuahua, Mexico — had received the measles vaccine, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. One dose of the vaccine is about 93% effective and two are 97% effective, meaning that some people can still get sick after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cases like this are very rare,” Dr. Ned Calonge, the state health department’s chief medical officer, said in a news release. “Staying up to date on vaccinations and being aware of health risks when traveling are important ways to protect yourself and your community. We’re sharing this information out of an abundance of caution to support early detection and limit the risk of further spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who get a breakthrough case are less likely to spread the virus than unvaccinated people, but anyone exposed to the virus should watch for symptoms, including a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes, Calonge said. If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call ahead before seeking medical care, so the clinic can keep them away from susceptible patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles patients can spread the virus for about four days before and four days after the characteristic rash develops. Symptoms can show up seven to 21 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most recent case is the fourth in Colorado linked to travel to Mexico, where the virus is spreading after an outbreak in Texas spilled across the border. The other three patients were a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/03/31/colorado-measles-pueblo-outbreak-public-health-mmr-vaccine/"&gt;Pueblo County adult&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;Denver infant&lt;/a&gt; and a person of unspecified age who &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/23/denver-measles-case-colorado/"&gt;lived in the same home as the baby&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Archuleta County adult also developed measles. That person didn’t travel, and health officials &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/04/08/denver-health-measles-emergency-room/"&gt;aren’t sure where they got the virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, 29 states have reported a combined 884 measles cases this year, which is more than triple the total last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210#cdc_data_surveillance_section_8-previous-years"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority — 646 — are in Texas, where an outbreak in the western part of the state that’s approaching the three-month mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two unvaccinated elementary school-aged children died from measles-related illnesses in the epicenter in West Texas, and an adult in New Mexico who was not vaccinated died of a measles-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As of Friday, April 25, the US has confirmed over 900 measles cases since the start of the year. The cases are across 29 states, but most are in or near Texas, where a massive outbreak continues to mushroom in close-knit, undervaccinated communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 24, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tallied &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;884 cases across the country&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the Texas health department updated its outbreak total, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;adding 22 cases&lt;/a&gt; to its last count from Tuesday. That brings the national total to at least 906 confirmed cases. Most of the cases are in unvaccinated children and teens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Texas has identified 664 cases since late January. Of those, 64 patients have been hospitalized, and two unvaccinated school-aged children with no underlying medical conditions have died of the disease. An unvaccinated adult in New Mexico also died from the infection, bringing this year's measles death toll to three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases and deaths are breaking records. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_5-yearly-measles-cases"&gt;In the past 30 years&lt;/a&gt;, the only year with more measles cases than the current tally was 2019, which saw 1,274 cases. Most of those cases were linked to large, extended outbreaks in New York City that took 11 months to quell. The US was just weeks away from losing its elimination status, an achievement earned in 2000 when the country first went 12 months without continuous transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, vaccination coverage of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine among US kindergartners has only fallen. National rates fell from 95 percent in 2019—the threshold considered necessary to keep measles from spreading—to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;92.7 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the 2023–24 school year, the most recent year for which there's data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On the brink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, amid the record annual case tally, cases had only reached &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6817e1.htm"&gt;a total of 704 by April 26&lt;/a&gt;. With this year's tally already over 900, the country is on track to record a new high. Before 2019, the next highest case total for measles was in 1994. That year, the country saw 899 cases, which 2025 has already surpassed.&lt;/p&gt;

This connection was most evident among men and those classified as underweight or overweight. The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.066" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggest that the distribution of body fat—not just overall body weight—may play a meaningful role in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While obesity and depression are known to often co-occur, many past studies have relied on body mass index (BMI) to define obesity. But BMI doesn’t distinguish between fat and muscle, nor does it capture where fat is located in the body. This limitation has led to mixed results in previous research. The current study aimed to take a closer look by using more precise tools to measure fat percentage in specific areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from 10,694 adults who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative study conducted in the United States. These participants had completed full-body scans using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), a technology that accurately measures fat, muscle, and bone. The scans allowed the researchers to analyze fat percentage in eight distinct regions: the legs, arms, trunk, head, android (abdominal), gynoid (hips and thighs), subtotal (excluding the head), and total body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess depression, the study used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a validated self-report measure of depressive symptoms. A score of 10 or higher on the PHQ-9 was used as a cutoff for clinically significant depression. Researchers also collected information about participants’ lifestyle habits, socioeconomic status, medical conditions, and biological markers, which allowed them to adjust their statistical models for many possible confounding factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that people in the highest quartile for total body fat had a significantly higher likelihood of reporting depression compared to those in the lowest quartile. This association remained even after adjusting for a wide range of demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables. Notably, the strongest associations were found for fat located in the legs, gynoid area, and subtotal region. People with higher head fat percentage also showed a modest increase in depression risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers examined differences by sex, they found that the association between body fat and depression was stronger in men than in women. This was especially true for fat in the legs and total body fat. In contrast, the connection was weaker or absent in women, except for some regions. This suggests that the effects of fat distribution on mood may operate differently depending on biological sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at whether the association varied across different BMI categories. Among individuals who were underweight or overweight, higher body fat percentages in several regions were consistently linked with increased depression risk. Interestingly, this pattern was not as clear in participants with a BMI in the normal range. This finding challenges the assumption that normal-weight individuals are at low risk for depression related to fat accumulation and highlights the importance of examining fat distribution rather than relying on weight alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest several possible explanations for these patterns. Biologically, excess fat tissue produces inflammatory molecules that may interfere with brain function and mood regulation. Hormones like leptin, which help control hunger and metabolism, can also become dysregulated in people with higher fat percentages, possibly affecting brain systems involved in emotion. Psychosocial factors may also play a role. Individuals with higher body fat, especially in visible areas, might experience greater stigma or body dissatisfaction, both of which can contribute to depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study adds to a growing body of evidence that body composition—and where fat is stored—can affect mental well-being. While BMI has long been the go-to measure in public health and clinical settings, this study shows that it may be too blunt an instrument to capture the nuances of how body fat influences mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, the study has some limitations. Because it was cross-sectional, it cannot determine whether higher body fat leads to depression or whether depression contributes to changes in body composition. Depression itself can influence eating habits, physical activity, and metabolic processes, which could alter body fat levels over time. The study also relied on a single self-report questionnaire to assess depression, without clinical interviews or additional mental health screenings. Moreover, since the research focused on a United States population, the findings may not apply to other cultural or healthcare settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could address these limitations by following participants over time to explore how changes in fat distribution might influence mental health. It would also be useful to examine how interventions that reduce specific types of body fat—through diet, exercise, or other means—might affect depression symptoms, especially in men or in people whose weight falls outside the typical range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.11.066" target="_blank"&gt;Association between body fat percentage and depression: A cross-sectional study of NHANES&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Wenjun Gu, Kunming Bao, Xiaoming Li, Shaohang Xiang, Junhao He, Jinning He, Lixin Ye, and Zhidong Huang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 22:03:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPRFhPNURvT3JXQmdNdTV0Si02NXVCakg2WXNCWERqVndIMlVEaHdlc19VX3hKcGRRSm11Y2Fucm5FbUtXYmdZajBKYTYtOWxfQ05aUXNCb1FmZkc2Nmd5WkltN2hsb2pfN1BnZ2xVbFZHc2hUMXlMcVhwNktKa0VyNXAxeDVTc2xTeUFDSFFR</guid></item><item><title>Austin Public Health表示，当地报告了第二例麻疹病例- KUT | Second measles case reported locally, Austin Public Health says - KUT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxQR0t1dkhPSzhjRG9LNnc0VlJ3N05sN3ZFaGZSMG8tZjBPRGh4M3JMY3pndlN5VEVZTnhYUHFwRWFETXFETG9ZT2RJRHV3UTZIMmFTVUFtcVZRS1diMWZ6X2NBel9JWXNpZnFBUXFjbmxiUnpKOUEwUmhabXBSX1lhemRtdWVDYW5oUlpKWEwtcVRndjR0cG5qdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArtP-articleBody"&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;A Travis County adult is isolating after testing positive for measles, Austin Public Health officials announced Friday. It is the second confirmed local case of the virus this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH &lt;a href="https://mailchi.mp/austintexas/second-measles-case-reported-in-travis-county?e=b0a255979d" class="Link" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;representatives said&lt;/a&gt; the sick individual may have been exposed to the virus while traveling in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient visited a state outside of Texas that is experiencing a rise in measles cases," APH spokesperson William Malm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The individual was reportedly vaccinated against measles, a highly contagious disease that can have severe complications. Typically, two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine offers 97% protection against the measles virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While a vaccinated person can still get measles, they are more likely to experience mild symptoms and are less likely to spread it,” Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County health authority, said in a statement. “We consider measles to be one of the most contagious viruses we know and getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walkes said people who are vaccinated should check with their doctors to see if they should get a booster dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH shared locations where the sick person may have exposed others. Those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Office building at 300 Colorado St., Wednesday, April 16&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maaribu Coffee Shop, 1413 S. First St., Thursday, April 17, 8:45 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Curra’s Restaurant, 614 E. Oltorf St., Thursday, April 17,  5:45 – 9:30 p.m. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Starbucks 1920 E.

Riverside Drive, Suite A110, Sunday, April 20, 8 a.m. - 12 p.m.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;APH said more locations could be added to the list as contact tracing continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at the listed locations during the timeframe identified should monitor for symptoms including rash, cough and fever, through May 11, APH said. Those who are pregnant and unvaccinated, or generally immunocompromised, and visited those locations during those times should contact their doctors now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late February, APH announced a measles case in an unvaccinated infant, who contracted the virus while traveling internationally with family. No additional exposures were announced following that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a measles outbreak is ongoing in West Texas, where more than 600 people have tested positive this year. Sixty-four of those individuals have been hospitalized. According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, the vast majority of those cases involve people who were not vaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;

Using AI, the team revealed that PHGDH has a hidden DNA-binding function unrelated to its known enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This malfunction triggers early Alzheimer’s development, offering a new target for prevention. They also identified a small molecule, NCT-503, that blocks this harmful activity without affecting normal brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Role of PHGDH:&lt;/strong&gt; AI revealed PHGDH acts as a DNA-binding disruptor, leading to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapeutic Candidate:&lt;/strong&gt; The small molecule NCT-503 blocks the harmful function without impairing normal activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated mice showed memory and anxiety improvements, suggesting clinical potential.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study found that a gene recently recognized as a biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease is actually a cause of it, due to its previously unknown secondary function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California San Diego used artificial intelligence to help both unravel this mystery of Alzheimer’s disease and discover a potential treatment that obstructs the gene’s moonlighting role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109165"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/AI-Alzheimers-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When the researchers tested NCT-503 in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, they saw that it significantly alleviated Alzheimer’s progression. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team published their results on April 23 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in nine people aged 65 and older has Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia. While some particular genes, when mutated, can lead to Alzheimer’s, that connection only accounts for a small percentage of all Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of patients do not have a mutation in a known disease-causing gene; instead, they have “spontaneous” Alzheimer’s, and the causes for that are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering those causes could ultimately improve medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease are very limited. And treatment responses are not outstanding at this moment,” said study senior author Sheng Zhong, a professor in the Shu Chien-Gene Lay Department of Bioengineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Zhong and his team took a closer look at phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which they had previously discovered as a potential blood biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a follow-up study, they later found that expression levels of the PHGDH gene directly correlated with changes in the brain in Alzheimer’s disease; in other words, the higher the levels of protein and RNA produced by the PHGDH gene, the more advanced the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That correlation has since been verified in multiple cohorts from different medical centers, according to Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued by this reproducible correlation, the research team decided to investigate in this latest study whether there was a causal effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice and human brain organoids, the researchers found that altering the amounts of PHGDH expression had consequential effects on Alzheimer’s disease: lower levels corresponded to less disease progression, whereas increasing the levels led to more disease advancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the researchers established that PHGDH is indeed a causal gene to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In further support of that finding, the researchers determined—with the help of AI—that PHGDH plays a previously undiscovered role: it triggers a pathway that disrupts how cells in the brain turn genes on and off. And such a disturbance can cause issues, like the development of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Moonlighting role&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHGDH creates an enzyme key for the production of serine, an essential amino acid and a neurotransmitter. Because PHGDH’s enzymatic activity was its only known role, the researchers hypothesized that its metabolic function must be connected to an Alzheimer’s outcome. However, all their experiments designed to prove so failed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At that time, our study hit a wall, and we didn’t have a clue of what mechanism it is,” said Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another Alzheimer’s project in his lab, which did not focus on PHGDH, changed all this. A year ago, that project revealed a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease: a widespread imbalance in the brain in the process where cells control which genes are turned on and off to carry out their specific roles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were curious if PHGDH had an unknown regulatory role in that process, and they turned to modern AI for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With AI, they could visualize the three-dimensional structure of the PHGDH protein. Within that structure, they discovered that the protein has a substructure that is very similar to a known DNA-binding domain in a class of known transcription factors. The similarity is solely in the structure and not in the protein sequence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhong said, “It really demanded modern AI to formulate the three-dimensional structure very precisely to make this discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After discovering the substructure, the team then demonstrated that with it, the protein can activate two critical target genes. That throws off the delicate balance, leading to several problems and eventually the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, PHGDH has a previously unknown role, independent of its enzymatic function, that through a novel pathway leads to spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ties back to the team’s earlier studies: the PHGDH gene produced more proteins in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients compared to the control brains, and those increased amounts of the protein in the brain triggered the imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While everyone has the PHGDH gene, the difference comes down to the expression level of the gene, or how many proteins are made by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Treatment option&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the researchers uncovered the mechanism, they wanted to figure out how to intervene and thus possibly identify a therapeutic candidate, which could help target the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many current treatments focus on treating the abnormal buildup of the sticky protein called beta-amyloid in the brain, some studies suggest that treating those plaques may be ineffective: essentially by that stage of accumulation, treatment is too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the critical pathway discovered in this study is upstream, so preventing this pathway can reduce amyloid plaque formation in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that PHGDH is such an important enzyme, there are past studies on its possible inhibitors. One small molecule, known as NCT-503, stood out to the researchers because it is not quite effective at impeding PHGDH’s enzymatic activity (the production of serine), which they did not want to change. NCT-503 is also able to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier, which is a desirable characteristic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They turned to AI again for three-dimensional visualization and modeling. They found that NCT-503 can access that DNA-binding substructure of PHGDH, thanks to a binding pocket. With more testing, they saw that NCT-503 does indeed inhibit PHGDH’s regulatory role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers tested NCT-503 in two mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease, they saw that it significantly alleviated Alzheimer’s progression. The treated mice demonstrated substantial improvement in their memory and anxiety tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests were chosen because Alzheimer’s patients suffer from cognitive decline and increased anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers do acknowledge limitations of their study. One being that there is no perfect animal model for spontaneous Alzheimer’s disease. They could test NCT-503 only in the mouse models that are available, which are those with mutations in those known disease-causing genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the results are promising, according to Zhong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now there is a therapeutic candidate with demonstrated efficacy that has the potential of being further developed into clinical tests,” said Zhong. “There may be entirely new classes of small molecules that can potentially be leveraged for development into future therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An advantage of small molecules is that they could even be administered orally, he added, unlike the current treatments that require infusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps will be to optimize the compound and subject it to FDA IND-enabling studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#513d3d3033383e2211243222357f343524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liezel Labios&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsd.edu"&gt;UCSD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liezel Labios – UCSD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.03.045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Transcriptional regulation by PHGDH drives amyloid pathology in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Sheng Zhong et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transcriptional regulation by PHGDH drives amyloid pathology in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually all individuals aged 65 or older develop at least early pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), yet most lack disease-causing mutations in APP, PSEN, or MAPT, and many do not carry the APOE4 risk allele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises questions about AD development in the general population. Although transcriptional dysregulation has not traditionally been a hallmark of AD, recent studies reveal significant epigenomic changes in late-onset AD (LOAD) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that altered expression of the LOAD biomarker phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) modulates AD pathology in mice and human brain organoids independent of its enzymatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHGDH has an uncharacterized role in transcriptional regulation, promoting the transcription of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKKa) and high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) in astrocytes, which suppress autophagy and accelerate amyloid pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blood-brain-barrier-permeable small-molecule inhibitor targeting PHGDH’s transcriptional function reduces amyloid pathology and improves AD-related behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight transcriptional regulation in LOAD and suggest therapeutic strategies beyond targeting familial mutations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 21:27:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9EN1dVRzdCdFhRTGdiemh5NUNQVjNWeDhqLUd2dnRtQTZxcVM5U0lscFlRQ0U2eDQyQjBtSWZJNFB0QmhZMTF6TkNZaUlDQ19SMkVpMjlTZ2FMX2JEQ2M1RTRobUlJZVlxZXc</guid></item><item><title>男子故意将艾滋病传染给癌症幸存者的妻子，她在确诊后2天死亡—他可能感染了其他女性：检察官-法律和犯罪新闻 | Man knowingly gave AIDS to cancer survivor wife who died 2 days after she was diagnosed — and he may have infected other women: Prosecutors - Law and Crime News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi-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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="post-body"&gt;

Inset: Cleveland Broadie (Rockdale County Sheriff’s Office).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/tag/georgia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Georgia&lt;/a&gt; man has been indicted on murder charges after his wife died after being diagnosed with AIDS — and prosecutors say &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/crazy/man-admits-to-getting-hiv-just-so-he-could-spread-it-to-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;he knew&lt;/a&gt; he was &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/crime/sheriff-man-who-groomed-raped-and-infected-child-with-hiv-used-tactics-that-were-the-best-ive-seen-in-the-worst-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;HIV-positive&lt;/a&gt; and never told her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Broadie, who is in his early 60s, was previously charged with reckless conduct after his wife, Denise Broadie, died in April 2022, two days after she was diagnosed with having AIDS. Now, a grand jury has indicted him for malice murder and felony murder in connection to Denise Broadie’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After she passed away, Denise Broadie’s family members suspected that their stepfather knew full well he was HIV-positive when he married their mother in 2014 and neglected to tell her about his status. WAGA, a local Fox affiliate, &lt;a href="https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/rockdale-county-man-charged-murder-accused-infecting-wife-aids" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;spoke to the family,&lt;/a&gt; who hired a private investigator to look into the life Cleveland Broadie had before he joined their family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denise Broadie was also battling cancer in the last years of her life. She had first been diagnosed in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2025/04/22/murder-charges-filed-against-hiv-positive-metro-atlanta-man/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to WANF&lt;/a&gt;, a local CBS affiliate, then went into remission. The cancer returned in 2019, and Denise Broadie beat it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she reportedly remained ill. When she went to a different hospital for treatment, new tests were administered, revealing that she had AIDS. According to an arrest warrant reviewed by Law&amp;amp;Crime, Denise Broadie was diagnosed with AIDS on March 31, 2022, “which resulted in her death” on April 2, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her family says she may have been living with AIDS for years without knowing it, years during which she could have been treated for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But according to her daughter, Karen Young, Cleveland Broadie never gave her the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young told WAGA, “There was malice in what he did. At any time, he could have told her and given her the right to make the decision to stay with him. Not that she would have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court records showed that Cleveland Broadie faced three charges of reckless conduct related to his wife’s death, all filed in 2023. Prosecutors alleged at the time that he had known of his HIV-positive status since 2006 and never informed his sexual partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to WANF, another woman came forward, sparking a second reckless conduct charge. A third charge soon followed when yet another woman came forward. The station &lt;a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2023/09/12/man-accused-intentionally-spreading-hiv-faces-new-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that “multiple women” had come forward in response to its story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Broadie was arrested and taken into custody on July 8, 2023. He pleaded not guilty to the three reckless conduct charges. It was not immediately clear as of Friday whether he had entered a plea to the murder charges.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When children lose their baby teeth, there is an adult set already growing beneath the gums, ready to emerge. But if we lose our permanent teeth, there aren't any more waiting in the wings. Right now, the options for replacing these lost teeth are either dentures or titanium implants, neither of which provide the same function and feedback as a real, living tooth.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Pamela Yelick, AG89, a professor at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, wants to be able to grow new, living teeth to replace those we've lost. In a paper &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/stcltm/article/doi/10.1093/stcltm/szae076/7933795" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2024 in &lt;i&gt;Stem Cells Translational Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, Yelick and her colleagues showed that they could grow human-like teeth in pigs using a combination of human and pig tooth cells. The work is a significant step toward replacing &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/dental+implants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt; with bioengineered living teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental implants typically have a base of titanium, which is anchored into the jawbone. Titanium integrates well with bone, but it doesn't have the soft tissue that surrounds a natural tooth root to cushion chewing forces and promote healthy bone turnover, or nerves to provide sensory feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the implant isn't perfectly aligned, or a person is chewing too hard, the bone around the implant can start to break down and be absorbed back into the body. This creates opportunities for bacteria to reach the implant, which can accelerate bone resorption and eventually cause the implant to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Even creating a tooth root that you could put an artificial crown on—with living dental pulp in the middle, secured by periodontal ligaments instead of being screwed into the jaw—could be a huge improvement to a person's oral health and in turn, systemic health," says Yelick, who also holds appointments in the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and in the School of Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Prompting the body to grow new teeth isn't easy. Our teeth start as a tooth bud—a little bulb of cells inside the jaw—which grows and differentiates into all the hard and soft tissues that make up a tooth and connect it to the jaw. The researchers needed to create their own bioengineered tooth bud with the right cell types and instructions to grow into a tooth on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooth bud is made of two types of cells: dental epithelial cells, which produce &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/tooth+enamel/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tooth enamel&lt;/a&gt;, and dental mesenchymal cells, which eventually form the rest of the tooth, including the dental pulp, dentin, cementum, and periodontal ligament tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelick and her team were able to collect dental mesenchymal cells from the pulp of extracted human wisdom teeth and other healthy teeth removed for orthodontic reasons, but dental epithelial cells are only present in the very early stages of tooth development. They can't be collected from people once our teeth have been formed. They can, however, be collected from unerupted teeth present in pig jaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike humans, pigs can grow multiple sets of adult teeth, so their adult jaws contain additional tooth buds. The researchers acquired pig jaws that would otherwise have been discarded from slaughterhouses and were able to extract tooth buds from them. They cultured these dental cells, as well as cells from human teeth, in the lab and then added them to a bioengineered scaffold that helped provide the necessary cues to start tooth development. Then they implanted these bioengineered tooth buds into the jaws of adult pigs, and monitored the animals for several months.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the bioengineered teeth developed at a similar rate as natural pig teeth, which is fairly close to that of human teeth. Because the experiment was only planned for three months, the teeth did not have a chance to emerge through the gums, but they underwent the same developmental stages as natural teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that we could make these beautiful little teeth," Yelick says. "They're still in the jaw—they haven't erupted yet—but they look just like natural human teeth."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelick and her colleagues hope to follow the tooth development for a longer duration in future experiments. They are also investigating the &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/signaling+molecules/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;signaling molecules&lt;/a&gt; that direct cell behavior, looking for ways to initiate tooth growth from within the jaw instead of needing to extract and culture cells separately in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their ultimate goal is to be able to prompt cells within a person's jaw to grow new, entirely human teeth—no pig cells required. There is still more work to be done before the researchers are able to grow a living replacement for a human tooth, but Yelick thinks it is achievable in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, you keep your teeth as long as possible. That's the best scenario," Yelick says. "But if something happens, we hope to have biological tooth substitutes available."&lt;/p&gt;

You cook your protein and your veggies all together, so they can absorb each other’s flavors and the flavors of whatever you season or dress them with. And when dinner is done, you just have one pan to clean. What is also satisfying about these sheet-pan dinners is that they’re all packed with protein, delivering 15 grams or more per serving. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913446/what-is-protein-why-do-you-need-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Protein&lt;/a&gt; is not only essential for muscle growth and repair but it also helps you feel fuller for longer and supports your immune system, among other benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These sheet-pan tacos are so satisfyingly crispy and crunchy. Pureeing the black beans in the food processor with taco seasoning, chipotles, salsa and some homemade crema makes a boldly flavored bean spread. Just spread it on the tortillas, add a little cheese, fold them in half and bake.

And choosing a salt-free version adds lots of flavor, negating the need for added salt. Once the chicken has roasted for 10 minutes, you’ll add some broccoli florets and cherry tomatoes to the pan to cook until tender. For a final touch and contrasting creamy texture, sprinkle crumbled feta on top. Serve everything with the pan juices and some whole-grain bread.

Using eye-tracking technology, researchers found that over 800 children from Sweden, Uganda, Bhutan, and Zimbabwe equally followed social cues like shared attention, regardless of poverty, trauma, or parental mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges long-held assumptions about early vulnerability and highlights the resilience of infant development even in hardship. While not all aspects of development are spared, the findings offer hope for the potential of early social learning in all children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Cultural Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Infants from war-torn or impoverished environments showed similar social cue-following as peers in secure homes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye-Tracking Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers used eye movement tracking to measure social attention in over 800 babies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental Stress Considered:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite parental trauma or depression, infants’ ability to share attention was not impaired.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Babies living as refugees have some of the same social skills as children with more secure home conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is shown by a new study that researchers from Uppsala University have conducted in cooperation with colleagues in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Bhutan. Over 800 children participated in the study, making it one of the largest infant studies ever conducted using eye movement measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109157"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows babies." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/baby-social-skills-trauma-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The questions in the forms were put to the participants by a local research assistant who could explain and contextualise the question.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised by the results. Previous research has shown – and we ourselves assumed– that the early infancy period is extremely vulnerable. That children’s development is influenced by the social, security and economic conditions in which they spend their early years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we saw in our study that children living in insecurity are not doomed. Some important social skills are intact. This inspires hope, though it doesn’t mean everything is all right,” says Gustaf Gredebäck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in Bhutan, Sweden, Uganda and Zimbabwe, and involved researchers in peace and conflict studies, game design and psychology. Between 100 and 300 children in each country participated in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It shows that regardless of poverty, traumatic experiences in the family, experiences of hunger, war and deep depression in parents, babies are equally good at following social cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To obtain a picture of the child’s background and circumstances, the researchers interviewed the child’s parents. They were asked to talk about their experiences of trauma and how they were feeling, and their response was used as an indicator of the parents’ wellbeing status and of their available resources to be a good enough parent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationally established concepts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all the countries, both children living in secure conditions with parents who were well and children living in troubled conditions with parents who were not well were studied. Trauma from war was only present in children in Uganda, but poverty was present in families in many countries and depression was present in all the countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The definition of traumatic events and poverty was based on established internationally validated scales and local differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions in the forms were put to the participants by a local research assistant who could explain and contextualise the question. It was often mental wellbeing issues that needed to be related to different concepts and patterns of thought in different countries. For poverty, country-specific indicators were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eye movement measurements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the children’s social activity and ability to follow what was happening around them, the researchers used eye movement measurements, filming children’s eyes and using an algorithm to calculate where the child was looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, it is possible to measure the extent to which a child follows the direction in which someone else is looking, i.e. what they are interested in and how they read what others are interested in. The children are involved in a process of sharing attention with other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By exploring the same ability in very different families in a new way, we can gain a deeper understanding of what we all have in common, the innate abilities that develop early in life. This is important for several reasons,” Gredebäck says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study gives hope and shows that early childhood holds opportunities for learning and development for all children, including those living in some of the most insecure environments in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was carried out in collaboration with researchers at Kabale University in Uganda, the University of Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe and Khesar Gyalpo University of Medical Sciences in Bhutan. From Uppsala University, researchers in peace and conflict studies, game design and psychology participated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The project is funded by the Wallenberg Academy Fellows Programme, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (KAW 2012.0120 and KAW 2017.0284).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social development and child trauma research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gustaf Gredebäck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uppsala University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gustaf Gredebäck – Uppsala University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251331042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Infant Gaze Following Is Stable Across Markedly Different Cultures and Resilient to Family Adversities Associated With War and Climate Change&lt;/a&gt;” by Gustaf Gredebäck et al. &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infant Gaze Following Is Stable Across Markedly Different Cultures and Resilient to Family Adversities Associated With War and Climate Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaze following in infancy allows triadic social interactions and a comprehension of other individuals and their surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its importance for early development, its ontology is debated, with theories suggesting that gaze following is either a universal core capacity or an experience-dependent learned behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A critical test of these theories among 809 nine-month-olds from Africa (Uganda and Zimbabwe), Europe (Sweden), and Asia (Bhutan) demonstrated that infants follow gaze to a similar degree regardless of environmental factors such as culture, maternal well-being (postpartum depression, well-being), or traumatic family events (related to war and/or climate change).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that gaze following may be a universal, experience-expectant process that is resilient to adversity and similar across a wide range of human experiences—a core foundation for social development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:28:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1oQnViRXZVT1Bxek45WEtrT25jZ2t0cjNsU2w5UWEyUFlTOHp6SDQ0SVdFdnV1RE9vWFliUmlGQ0pPMmIxekhGay1xd2poakNGZDdVTVpIclNqQ0EyN3RhWTdGUGFmNVhBQmMyZFJjUQ</guid></item><item><title>低度和中度运动可能有助于预防阿尔茨海默氏症的衰退-神经科学新闻 | Low and Moderate Exercise May Help Prevent Alzheimer’s Decline - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE9uQUVzVlk5WXpiZUhUZkdHT0tpY1E0UGFVRURTSFVtSEJHQVhTY05MVG53dkVHV081anVOMEdUcFFGbWszeElISHJfclhvXzR4aThEeF8zZ0ZFNjRMTUZKZlRWRTdneWpiaXhmV1pR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New findings from the EXERT study reveal that both low and moderate-high intensity exercise may help preserve cognitive function in older adults with mild memory problems—a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Over 12 months, participants who engaged in either form of exercise showed significantly less cognitive decline and reduced brain volume loss, especially in the prefrontal cortex, compared to a usual-care group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research highlights the value of accessible, community-based fitness interventions for individuals at high risk of dementia. Even low-intensity activities like stretching and balance exercises proved effective in slowing decline, suggesting a simple and feasible path toward brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slowed Decline:&lt;/strong&gt; Both low and moderate-high intensity exercise stabilized cognitive function over 12 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Volume Preservation:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants in both exercise groups showed less brain volume loss, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Feasibility:&lt;/strong&gt; The trial partnered with local YMCAs, showing real-world implementation is possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at University of California San Diego and Wake Forest University have found that both low and moderate-high intensity exercise could be valuable tools in the fight against Alzheimer’s. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research, published as two papers in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;, describes the results of the EXERT study (Exercise in Adults with Mild Memory Problems), a multi-site clinical trial of lower or moderate-high intensity exercise in sedentary older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109133"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older lady exercising and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/Alzheimers-exercise-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This suggests that both lower and higher intensity exercise could slow cognitive decline. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also compared their results to an existing dataset of comparable individuals who only received usual care, such as regular check-ups with health care providers and medication management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In EXERT participants, cognitive function remained stable over 12 months in both low and moderate-high intensity exercise groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both forms of exercise were associated with significantly less cognitive decline over 12 months when compared to individuals who were not involved in the exercise study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both EXERT exercise groups tended to show less brain volume loss over 12 months, including in the prefrontal cortex.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, a condition characterized by memory complaints and objective memory decline, are at high risk of developing Alzheimer’s dementia, with approximately 16% of people with this condition progressing to Alzheimer’s each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a critical time to intervene in this population, because they don’t have dementia yet, but are at a very high risk,” said Aladdin Shadyab, Ph.D., M.P.H., lead author of one of the new papers and associate professor at the UC San Diego Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science and School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, these findings show us that even low intensity exercise may slow cognitive decline in at-risk older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have suggested that exercise may be beneficial for cognitive health, the evidence has been mixed, and large, well-designed studies are needed to fully understand the potential benefits of exercise for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EXERT study, coordinated by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at UC San Diego, in partnership with Wake Forest University School of Medicine, fills this gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EXERT was one of the first large clinical trials of exercise that partnered with the YMCA and its trainers to bring the intervention closer to home for research participants,” said Howard Feldman, M.D., ADCS director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This approach brings us one step closer to its implementation in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ADCS was formed in 1991 under a cooperative agreement between the National Institute on Aging and UC San Diego and is one of the key initiatives for Alzheimer’s research supported by the federal government, addressing treatments for both cognitive and behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s an urgent need to identify effective and feasible ways to prevent and treat Alzheimer’s dementia, and UC San Diego has been a leader in this field for many years,” added Feldman, who is also a professor in the Department of Neurosciences at UC San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXERT included nearly 300 sedentary older adults with mild cognitive impairment who were randomly assigned to either moderate-high intensity aerobic training or lower-intensity stretching, balance and range of motion activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed their assigned exercise 3-4 times per week for 12 months under the supervision of a YMCA trainer, and the study also included regular assessments of cognitive function and brain volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“EXERT is a landmark study because it’s the largest rigorous trial of exercise ever conducted in adults with mild cognitive impairment,” said Laura Baker, Ph.D., principal investigator of the EXERT study and professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise has well-documented benefits to nearly every aspect of human health, but we’re still unlocking the full potential of exercise as medicine for older adults with memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the researchers expected to see further cognitive decline in EXERT participants, they actually found that cognitive function remained stable for both exercise groups over the course of the study. This suggests that both lower and higher intensity exercise could slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possible explanation for the results is that participating in research itself, regardless of the treatment, may offer protection against cognitive decline due to the intellectual and social stimulation involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings of both studies taken together suggest that exercise may be a promising, safe, and feasible strategy to promote brain health and prevent continued cognitive decline for older adults with mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there’s still a lot to learn, these findings show that regular intensity exercise, even at low intensity, could go a long way toward helping older adults slow or delay cognitive decline, and this is promising news for those who are at high risk for dementia,” added Shadyab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The EXERT study was supported through the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging (U19AG010483-25 and AG058644) and by the Brain Research Foundation (BRF ECD-2014-01).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosures:&lt;/strong&gt; Feldman receives grant funding from the National Institute on Aging (U19AG010483-22), from Biohaven Pharmaceuticals, Vivoryon (Probiodrug), and LuMind Foundation; service agreements for consulting activities with LuMind, Axon Neuroscience, Novo Nordisk, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Roche/Genentech Pharmaceuticals (DMC/DSMB), Tau Consortium (SAB), and Janssen Research &amp;amp; Development (DSMB); support for travel from Novo Nordisk, Royal Society of Canada, Translating Research in Elder Care (TREC), Association for Frontotemporal Dementia (AFTD), and Rainwater Charitable Foundation; and a philanthropic donation for the Epstein Family Alzheimer Research Collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No personal funds have been received for these activities.

Researchers found that clusters of serotonin neurons compete and collaborate, shaping when and how serotonin is released throughout the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery challenges older views of a uniform serotonin signal and may have major implications for understanding mood disorders and how the brain handles binary decisions. The team identified a brain circuit involving the lateral habenula that helps compute “go” or “don’t go” decisions in response to perceived threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serotonin Networks:&lt;/strong&gt; Serotonin neurons form interconnected ensembles that regulate dynamic serotonin release.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision Circuits:&lt;/strong&gt; A newly identified circuit links the lateral habenula to serotonin activity, guiding binary decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; This new understanding could inform targeted therapies for mood disorders like depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our lives are filled with binary decisions – choices between one of two alternatives. But what’s really happening inside our brains when we engage in this kind of decision-making?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine-led study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; sheds new light on these big questions, illuminating a general principle of neural processing in a mysterious region of the midbrain that is the very origin of our central serotonin (5-HT) system, a key part of the nervous system involved in a remarkable range of cognitive and behavioral functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109153"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a person at a cross roads." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/serotonin-decision-making-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The research team’s work has implications for how our brain – an organ with profoundly intricate wiring of neurons with multitudes of enmeshed connections – is involved in day-to-day decision making. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current dominating model is that individual 5-HT neurons are acting independently one from another. While it had previously been suggested that 5-HT neurons may rather be connected with one another, it had not been directly demonstrated. That is what we did here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We also identify an intriguing processing role – or a computation – that is supported by this particular type of connectivity between 5-HT neurons,” says Dr. Jean-Claude Béïque, full professor in the Faculty’s Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine and co-director of the uOttawa Brain and Mind Research Institute’s Centre for Neural Dynamics and Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The international research team’s work involved a mixture of several experimental approaches such as electrophysiology, cellular imaging, optogenetics and behavioral approaches, along with mathematical modeling and computer simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forging advances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what does it mean that serotonin neurons clustered together in the brainstem are not independent actors largely keeping to themselves but are actually sending axons to the rest of the brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my view, the paper’s main takeaway is that the mammalian serotonin system is far more anatomically and functionally complex than what we previously imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is knowledge that could potentially help develop targeted therapeutics for mood disorders like major depressive disorder,” says Dr. Michael Lynn, the study’s first author and a former member of Dr. Béïque’s Faculty of Medicine lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lynn received his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Ottawa in October 2023. He’s now working as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford, in the Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the team’s findings are important because it turns out that there are distinct groups of serotonin neurons with their own activity patterns, each controlling serotonin release in a particular region of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has implications for the “winner-takes-all” principle of neuroscience – an idea applied in computational models of neural networks in which neurons essentially compete to get activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new principles uncovered in this paper suggest that these distinct ensembles can interact in some scenarios: ‘winning’ serotonin ensembles with high activity can strongly reduce serotonin release from ‘losing’ serotonin ensembles with lower activity levels,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These imply a more complex, dynamic set of rules about how and when serotonin is released throughout the brain, contrasting with an older view of a more monolithic signal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decisions, decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team’s work has implications for how our brain – an organ with profoundly intricate wiring of neurons with multitudes of enmeshed connections – is involved in day-to-day decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They determined how the lateral habenula, a region that is activated when we are frustrated and that is implicated in major depression, ultimately controls the activity of serotonin neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Habenular neurons are also believed to encode the level of threat that is perceived from a particular environment, or perhaps even from our actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Béïque explains it like this: “Do we jump from the high diving board at the pool? Or only from the low one? Do we walk down that very dark alley, or do we avoid it?  When is dark too dark?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Somehow our brain must compute features of our world – including how threatening a particular environment is – and come up with a binary output: you go, or you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think we have identified a circuit that participates in that very computation that guides our everyday decisions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next for the research team as they build on the advances they have forged over several years with this methodical, innovative examination of the serotonin system? They aim to focus on behavioral studies with mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, the behavioral manifestations of the computation we discovered were somewhat artificial behavior. We’re currently trying to see if we can see similar things when mice are behaving in more naturalistic environments,” Dr. Béïque says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talent-rich research team for the new &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper included the uOttawa Faculty of Medicine’s Dr. Richard Naud, a computational neuroscientist who was the senior author on a recent serotonin-related study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, and Sean Geddes, director of Innovation and Partnerships at Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this serotonin and decision-making research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b6c6dad9d1d9c2ded3f6c3d9c2c2d7c1d798d5d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paul Logothetis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uottawa.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Ottawa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Paul Logothetis – University of Ottawa&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01912-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nonlinear recurrent inhibition through facilitating serotonin release in the raphe&lt;/a&gt;” by Jean-Claude Béïque et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonlinear recurrent inhibition through facilitating serotonin release in the raphe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receive a constellation of long-range inputs, yet guiding principles of local circuit organization and underlying computations in this nucleus are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using inputs from the lateral habenula to interrogate the processing features of the mouse DRN, we uncovered 5-HT1A receptor-mediated recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular electrophysiology and imaging of a genetically encoded 5-HT sensor revealed that these recurrent inhibitory connections spanned the raphe, were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating and gated spike output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features collectively conveyed highly nonlinear dynamics to this network, generating excitation-driven inhibition and winner-take-all computations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vivo optogenetic activation of lateral habenula inputs to DRN, at frequencies where these computations are predicted to ignite, transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

in the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-028a6640-2209-11f0-9741-3dbcd068db7a"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; drug supply in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the year, officials found 46 people who had died from fatal drug overdoses over the year had consumed medetomidine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And experts are warning it has now made its way into three-quarters of the illicit drug supply.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Lynch, an emergency medicine doctor at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said: 'We know it's probably in about half to three-quarters of our drug supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It can] depress your breathing a little bit, lowers your heart rate, and, to a lesser degree, can lower your blood pressure. And it can last for several hours where people are very, very sleepy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Officials are warning that medetomidine, a drug used for sedation and pain relief in pet dogs and cats, is being mixed with fentanyl and other opioids and sold in multiple states. (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told CBS: 'It is so different and so severe and progresses so rapidly and doesn't respond to the usual treatments that we use for withdrawal from different substances like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-4e0c7e20-21ee-11f0-bb9f-d7e91671f6a4" class=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; or opioids or benzodiazepines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medetomidine was also detected in several seized drug samples across Maryland in July 2022, suggesting the drug is spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended dose of medetomidine for dogs is 750 micrograms and less than 20 mg for cats given through an IV drip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite not being intended for use in humans, there is another form of medetomidine, sold under brand names Dexdor and Precedex, that is used for sedation and muscle relaxation in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It remains unclear how much of medetomidine can be lethal to human life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medetomidine is often cut with other drugs like fentanyl because when mixed with opioids and other substances, it greatly increases the sedative effects of each drug, which people may perceive as a better or stronger product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sedative has most frequently been observed in samples containing fentanyl and xylazine, but the drug has also been identified together with heroin and cocaine, the Center for Forensic Science Research and Education said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to dropping the heart rate dangerously low, it can cause serious effects such as hallucinations and last longer than other illicit substances it is mixed with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug, which is estimated to be 200 times more powerful than xylazine, also slows neurological functions in the body, resulting in confusion and lethargy, as well as symptoms of opioid overdose like shallow breathing and small pupils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drug is not intended for long-term human use and can make dangerous changes to heart rate and mental state - leaving patients in a state of extreme sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: People, some with drug dependency issues sit along a sidewalk in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some medetomidine overdose symptoms include uncontrollable vomiting, excessive sweating, life-threatening levels of blood pressure, fluctuating mental state, tremors and a heart rate over 100 beats a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health has asked healthcare providers to use naloxone, usually used to treat opioids as treatment against medetomidine overdose - despite the latter drug not being an opioid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medication works by attaching itself to medetomidine receptors and reverses and blocks the effects of it by neutralizing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can quickly restore normal breathing if it has slowed or stopped due to an overdose and help the body return to its a normal state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Raagini Jawa, infectious disease and addiction medicine physician at UPMC told the Post Gazette: 'Naloxone is still the first-line agent for overdose reversal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We really need to educate people about rescue breathing and making sure we’re protecting their airways and calling for help, so that if they need oxygen, emergency services can provide supplemental oxygen support for them.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 19:43:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOMGRJZ0JKNU81WW9YeUU0SUhEc0pxb29oajk2QUpvaGlsaEd6bC11b3lkZXk2M0k3U01jYUdBMm1PaHVxZENmSDNyU1RFRkRfYTVzS0hzeU9mcjk5WDlLV1NpMUxyN1pqQnNZZk85dDJlbEdseGJBYXl4Tkp0VElaSmx6QVd3ZjdDU0lHeVpnNllFbTdwOTc3RVhrQ1JRSFFMckHSAacBQVVfeXFMTV9QUzRUem1wUi1qdzUxVkd4MnhUazU5S0NzNTFZakt1R2RXaWx2QjNSVXBYNk5rNzZMTEtrSUVMS3VJTEgxNV9uY2RLc0FaNGE5cHltQW14RGNUWEVzaERlcXRnRzNkc0hIcHJ3eXpTV3l6a2hDV1lRTHJ2OXRScmpXRVhSby1vOTUzVjY0Q2tsM3JLbDJEMC13QV9CYkxqQUUyaS1QYkU</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州报告2025年前三个月山谷热病例急剧上升-《洛杉矶时报》 | California reports sharp rise in valley fever cases for first three months of 2025 - Los Angeles Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxQRVRZbGp5czhTenR5RzQ1RlFvVGg5ODc1ZTd4TVd0dks1dkNwVHlHUFI3TENUXy1sOW81NjI1UEdla09leE9obmtPYkNIcU9RbWstT2VMTmVfbWFWWnVfd1ExWVdFaHFNNzRtd2NPYVEwcFoxTXN0QXVMQkVlM28xSlp0SEpFUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-body font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 text-primary-text-color clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;California is heading toward another record year for cases of valley fever, the disease caused by fungal spores linked to cycles of drought and precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 3,123 reported cases of valley fever in the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverProvisionalDashboard.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first three months of the year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, according to state health officials — roughly double the 10-year average for the first-quarter time period. Cases ranged from a low of 801 in 2016 to 3,011 last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with the fungus won’t experience symptoms, and their bodies will fight off the infection naturally. Those who do suffer symptoms however are often hard-pressed to recognize them, as they resemble the onset of COVID or the flu, further complicating efforts to address the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is caused by inhaling spores of coccidioides, a fungal pathogen that thrives in the drier and dustier regions of the state. The fungus is released when the dry soil where it grows is disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We actually had sort of seen this coming, just based on the climate cycle of the last few years,” said George R. Thompson, a professor of medicine at the UC Davis School of Medicine and a specialist in invasive fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(22)00202-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;has shown that patterns of drought and precipitation play important roles in the number of valley fever cases in California, said Doua Ge Yang, a spokeswoman for the state’s Department of Public Health. “When there are several years of drought in California, followed by a wet winter, and then a dry summer,” there are increases in valley fever cases for the following two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said 2023 typified such a scenario, and as predicted, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-12-27/valley-fever-cases-spike-in-california"&gt;2024 resulted in a record-high case count&lt;/a&gt;, with 12,637 cases recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Valley fever is on the rise in California,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the numbers for 2025 are so far higher than any previously recorded first quarter, Yang said health officials can’t predict whether it will remain a record year. She also noted that all the numbers from 2024 and 2025 are considered preliminary — and therefore demographic issues such as age, sex and race cannot yet be reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to patterns of rain and drought, research shows that other factors can play a role in incidents of valley fever — including soil disturbance, such as the kind accompanying construction activity, wild fires and even archaeological digs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction workers, firefighters and archaeologists working in the dry, arid regions of the state are at increased risk of getting the disease — especially as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/04/30/californias-population-is-increasing/" target="_blank"&gt;Californians move into these previously less inhabited regions of the state.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, at least 19 people who &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-10-02/the-threat-of-valley-fever-is-growing-in-central-california"&gt;attended Lightning in a Bottle, a five-day music and art festival held at Buena Vista lake in Kern County&lt;/a&gt;, came down with the disease — including several who reported severe effects that  included pneumonia-like symptoms, rashes, headaches and exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The festival’s organizers will be holding the event again this year at the same location. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.libfestival.org/dustmitigation" target="_blank"&gt;According to the festival website&lt;/a&gt;, organizers will try to reduce dust by applying water to the ground to keep it in place, adding artificial turf in front of the stages for dancing, and reducing the number of motorized vehicles used by staff around the site, and placing additional wood chips over heavy traffic areas to suppress dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most people clear the infection on their own, the true number of afflicted people is not known. If a person’s immune system is unable to clear the infection  and it is left untreated, it can cause death or permanent disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment varies depending upon severity, but antifungal drugs, such as  fluconazole (Diflucan) or itraconazole (Sporanox, Tolsura), are the most common medications used. However, they come with serious side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, dry skin, dry mouth and chapped lips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While several Central and Southern California counties have seen recent increases in their case counts, Monterey’s numbers have ballooned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, there were 22 cases reported during the first quarter in the Central California county; this year, the number is 217.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials said they began seeing a surge in November of last year, at which point they sent out &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.countyofmonterey.gov/Home/Components/News/News/11080/" target="_blank"&gt;a health advisory&lt;/a&gt; to local medical providers and clinics providing information about the disease and testing guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monterey County spokeswoman Karen Smith said that many residents had experienced severe disease and delays in their treatment and diagnosis. She said rates were highest for people who live in the southern part of the county and in the largely agricultural Salinas Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the county encourages people to reduce their risk of getting the disease by avoiding breathing in dirt and dust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, the UC Davis doctor and researcher, said there has been anecdotal evidence that the disease may be increasing in severity, and there are concerns that it may also have acquired some immunity to the common antifungal medicines used to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some theorize that the widespread use of antifungal chemicals on crops in areas where the fungus is endemic may be contributing to its resistance, but research on the topic is only just getting underway and answers so far are elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there’s a statewide effort looking into these issues, that includes participation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state’s public health department, UC Davis, UC San Francisco, and  Cal State Fresno and Cal State Bakersfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the disease for years had largely been sidelined in public health circles, as attention and funding was targeted at other pathogens that had wider and more severe impacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hate to disparage that, but I think with limited resources, public health agencies do have to really prioritize certain pathogens,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:38:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxQRVRZbGp5czhTenR5RzQ1RlFvVGg5ODc1ZTd4TVd0dks1dkNwVHlHUFI3TENUXy1sOW81NjI1UEdla09leE9obmtPYkNIcU9RbWstT2VMTmVfbWFWWnVfd1ExWVdFaHFNNzRtd2NPYVEwcFoxTXN0QXVMQkVlM28xSlp0SEpFUQ</guid></item><item><title>详细的性感和厌恶感觉地图揭示了女性如何体验性触摸- PsyPost | Detailed erogenous and aversive sensation maps reveal how women experience sexual touch - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPN2JqZ1JFSGJNUjRucmNCVG9RRHVFUXJQYktydjREU0t5M3hDc1FlRWZqUTRWLUdwWTE0ZlAzdzJ3UWJmNkJLVDFYR0JzRVlSODY2SXJKTXkxbUdZeFI2cDhxSlNuU2dwS3AxQUR3MGkzM1BHS0hEOUF0Q0U1YW82cVJISVlWSHFoQ1ZIVG5tbkhLYWtDdkh4enN4WEVVWko1Qk0zbFdIcEZfb2xzeVpHcDBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have created comprehensive maps of women’s erogenous and aversive zones, pinpointing exactly which areas of the vulva, vagina, and breasts contribute most to sexual pleasure—and which are often avoided. Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jsxmed/qdae143" target="_blank"&gt;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the study offers new insights into sexual sensation and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to fill several gaps in the current scientific understanding of sexual sensation. Past research has often excluded people with vulvas, overlooked internal genital structures, or failed to quantify how important specific areas are to sexual pleasure. Additionally, there has been almost no systematic study of areas that individuals dislike having touched during sex—referred to in this research as aversive sensation zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these gaps, the research team created a detailed anatomical survey, approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Review Board, that asked respondents to indicate which specific areas of the breasts, vulva, and vagina they found pleasurable or aversive during partnered sex. A total of 499 women completed the survey, but only the 441 who reported having had partnered sexual experience were included in the final analysis. Participants were between 18 and 83 years old, with an average age of 49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using anatomically precise illustrations of both external and internal genital structures, respondents selected specific zones they found pleasurable during sex and rated how important each zone was to their overall sexual pleasure on a 10-point scale. For aversive zones, they indicated which body parts they disliked being touched and selected from a list of potential reasons, such as pain, oversensitivity, shame, or past negative experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequently selected erogenous areas were in the vulva, with 82% of respondents identifying at least one pleasurable zone in that region. The vaginal introitus, periurethral area, and glans clitoris were the top three choices. (The vaginal introitus is the external opening of the vagina, the periurethral area is the region immediately surrounding the urethral opening, and the glans clitoris is the visible, sensitive tip of the clitoris.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glans clitoris received the highest average importance rating of all areas in the study, with a score of 9 out of 10. This supports existing evidence that the clitoris plays a central role in sexual pleasure for many women, but the prominence of the vaginal introitus was an unexpected result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast tissue and nipples were also commonly cited as sources of pleasure. About 58% of participants identified breast tissue as an erogenous zone, while 43% selected the nipples. However, the nipples were also the most frequently selected aversive zone among the breast subareas. Reasons given for nipple aversion included oversensitivity and pain. Notably, younger women were more likely to report pleasure in breast zones, suggesting some age-related variation in sensitivity or preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responses regarding the vagina highlighted the superficial anterior wall—often associated with the “G-spot”—as the most pleasurable area inside the vaginal canal. Nearly half of respondents selected this area, giving it a high average importance rating. Fewer people selected the cervix or deep vaginal walls, and these areas were more frequently flagged as aversive, primarily due to pain or discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anus was the most frequently selected aversive zone in the entire study, with 34% of participants reporting that they disliked its stimulation during sex. While 12% did identify it as pleasurable, the overwhelming majority of negative responses reflected not only physical discomfort but also emotional responses such as shame or embarrassment. This pattern persisted across different age groups, suggesting that cultural stigma around anal contact remains prevalent despite its growing visibility in media and sex education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although most results were consistent across demographic subgroups, age emerged as a meaningful variable. Younger respondents were more likely to identify a wider range of areas—across the breasts, vulva, and vagina—as pleasurable. This could reflect both generational differences in sexual norms and physiological differences related to hormonal changes. Many respondents were likely in perimenopause or menopause, a life stage known to impact genital sensation and libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings offer potential applications beyond academic research. Erogenous maps could help clinicians, therapists, and surgeons understand individual variability in sexual sensation, especially for people undergoing medical treatments or procedures that affect the genital area. For example, individuals recovering from cancer treatment, gender-affirming surgeries, or pelvic floor trauma may benefit from personalized sensation maps to monitor changes or tailor interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These maps also challenge conventional ideas about which body parts are considered “universally” pleasurable. For instance, while the glans clitoris is often highlighted in discussions about female sexual pleasure, this study suggests that other regions—like the vaginal introitus or the superficial anterior vaginal wall—are equally or even more significant for some women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aversive zone data provide insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of sexual experience. Pain and oversensitivity were the most common reasons for aversion across all areas. But when it came to the anus, feelings of disgust and shame were disproportionately high. These emotional responses underscore the need for more open, nonjudgmental conversations about sexuality, as well as individualized sexual health education that respects diverse experiences and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths—including a relatively large sample size and anatomically detailed illustrations—this study has limitations. Its retrospective and anonymous nature limited the amount of background information collected about participants. Only 62% of respondents had engaged in sexual activity within the year prior to the survey, which means that some data relied on recollections of older experiences. The survey also excluded transgender and gender-diverse individuals, so its findings cannot be generalized to all people with vulvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on this study by including more diverse populations and tracking changes in sensation over time. For example, it would be useful to examine how erogenous and aversive zones shift after hormonal changes, medical treatments, or use of specific sexual health interventions such as pelvic floor therapy or vibratory stimulation. Studies could also investigate neuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to reorganize sensory maps—and how this might affect sexual function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study,  “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/22/1/7/7905380?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;Anatomic maps of erogenous and aversive sensation zones of the breasts, vulva, and vagina: A questionnaire-based study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jenna Stelmar, Michael Zaliznyak, Sandeep Sandhu, Dylan Isaacson, Erin Duralde, Shannon M.

But eating that much chicken may not be as healthy as once thought, according to a recent study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the study, researchers investigated the connection between poultry consumption, gastrointestinal &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/04/24/cancer-prevention-progress-setback/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, and early death. Poultry refers to all forms of birds, including chicken, turkey, duck, and game birds like quail and pheasants. Examining data from 4,869 middle-aged Italian participants over 19 years, who answered surveys about their food and beverage consumption, researchers found that white meat consumption (rabbit and poultry) was highest among those who died of gastrointestinal cancers—&lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/childhood-exposure-bacteria-colorectal-cancer-rates-millennials-gen-xers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt;, liver, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal, and rectal cancer, for example—with poultry intake accounting for 33% of their white meat intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who consumed over 300 grams of poultry per week—about 3.5 three-ounce servings—had a 27% higher mortality rate from all causes. For men in particular, that rate jumped to 61%. For gastrointestinal cancer specifically, they found that consuming 100 to 200 grams of poultry per week was associated with a 65% increased risk of death from gastrointestinal cancer compared to other cancers, while participants who consumed over 300 grams of poultry every week were 127% more likely to die from gastrointestinal cancer, with this risk even greater at 161% for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much chicken should you eat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the study, the less poultry consumed the better. While the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dietary Guidelines for Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommends that adults should eat 26 ounces per week of lean meat and poultry (in a 2,000-calorie diet), following the study’s guidance of less than 300 grams per week would mean consuming no more than 10.5 ounces of chicken per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Our results show that consumption of more than 100 grams per week of poultry was associated with an increased risk of death both from all causes and from gastrointestinal cancer,” the study authors wrote. As poultry consumption increased, so did mortality risk—and the results were even more pronounced for those who consumed higher portions of red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study participants, who at age 83, consumed less than 100 grams of poultry per week had half the mortality risk from gastrointestinal cancer than those who consumed more than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers also suggested that the way chicken is cooked may affect how it impacts your health. White meat cooked at higher temperatures—like grilling or barbecuing—or for long periods in a stew could form high levels of agents that cause genetic mutation, which could influence the development of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to overall meat consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers found that overall meat consumption plays a substantial role in mortality risk—even when following one of the most recommended diets for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants who died of non-gastrointestinal cancers had diets where red meat accounted for over 65% of their total meat intake, as compared to 56% and 58% among those who died of gastrointestinal cancers and other causes, respectively. Over half of cancer-related deaths occurred in people who consumed over 400 grams of meat every week—even when on the &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/04/14/mediterranean-diet-heath-benefits-science/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mediterranean diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We believe it is beneficial to moderate poultry consumption, alternating it with other equally valuable protein sources, such as fish,” the authors wrote. “We also believe it is essential to focus more on cooking methods, avoiding high temperatures and prolonged cooking times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more on diet and health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This story was originally featured on &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/chicken-per-week-mortality-cancer-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNd2xVaGw1dGhkemtTakpzUU1IOHJLcmloYktwQmZlMHF6R01hblZENi1jTldPNjVESU1HMkJjVV9rY2lVQ2VYOEtrZF83T1hKZUp3UkZPOG5FSWVFdXotMm9QTFFDaHdGX2FpSDh5Vzh5eXR4aU05R210M0hEd0xhM29Ic2h5OXdIOENkUlNB</guid></item><item><title>研究人员警告说，每周吃这么多鸡肉可能会增加死亡风险-财富 | Researchers warn that eating this amount of chicken per week could increase your mortality risk - Fortune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBkb3h1Q0tXSVJ6ZGlaNGZQZU5OVnFmM041SzBjODh0Wms3M3M2dXUwY2dPb2tQSVRJdUNGZllkdU80ZW14S05iM0NFeEZMOVhCYWdidTQ0WFBtUElPTjFIRHhfZE11SmQzNDd0WjUyV2JQZEJOdGZXZnNxb20?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fortune</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 18:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTFBkb3h1Q0tXSVJ6ZGlaNGZQZU5OVnFmM041SzBjODh0Wms3M3M2dXUwY2dPb2tQSVRJdUNGZllkdU80ZW14S05iM0NFeEZMOVhCYWdidTQ0WFBtUElPTjFIRHhfZE11SmQzNDd0WjUyV2JQZEJOdGZXZnNxb20</guid></item><item><title>美国有近900例麻疹病例。以下是您需要了解的信息- ABC新闻 | There are nearly 900 measles cases in the US.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first item to add to your grocery list is apples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He reveals that apples - which have around 95 calories per fruit - have something called chlorogenic acid inside their flesh,  which 'turns on your brown fat' to burn down your white fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A review of the health benefits of apples conducted by food scientists at Cornell University also praises the fruit as a weight loss aid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reviewing research, they concluded: 'Based on these epidemiological studies, it appears that apples may play a large role in reducing the risk of a wide variety of chronic disease and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in general. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Of the papers reviewed, apples were most consistently associated with reduced risk of cancer, heart disease, asthma, and type II diabetes when compared to other fruits and vegetables and other sources of flavonoids. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Apple consumption was also positively associated with increased lung function and increased weight loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li's second and third food recommendations to slim down are broccoli and kale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These contain a phytochemical called sulforaphane, which also helps to activate brown fat cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are also low in calories, with both providing around 30 calories per cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One of the food expert's favorite foods to promote weight loss is bok choy, due to its low calorie content, high fiber and nutrient density&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert's fourth favorite food to promote weight loss is bok choy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to its low calorie content (just 9 calories per cup), high fiber and nutrient density, Di Li says it is a great vegetable for dieters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber helps maintain a healthy weight, as it makes you feel fuller for longer and therefore reduces the likelihood of overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on the best way to prepare the bok choy, he says: 'You cut off the bottoms, you wash the leaves, take a wok or a skillet, a little extra virgin olive oil, a little garlic, [and] sauté that up.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He highlights that instead of butter, he recommends using olive oil, with this being his fifth fat-reducing superfood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it is calorie-rich - with around 120 calories per tablespoon - it provides numerous health benefits due to its nutritional content, especially extra virgin olive oil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two ingredients Di Li points to in olive oil for their health boosting properties are hydroxytyrosol and oleocanthal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest hydroxytyrosol can increase fatty acid oxidation, potentially boosting the body's ability to burn fat, and it may also help reduce inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity, further contributing to weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, studies have shown oleocanthal may contribute to weight loss and improved heart health due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It reduces inflammation in a way similar to ibuprofen, by blocking inflammatory enzymes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Li concludes: 'Now you actually have the greens and the olive oil, that will trigger your brown fat to turn it down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 17:32:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOZmFkTkN4MUtzbERXOXdDYVVkd25uX2N0VmdhZjRfdS1iU2RWZmJpVGVISWFNZWZ6SXExQmpoRHdFU0lyRk5rUXZrdG1NVFZXaEktcGZHYnZ3cFRQeThWTFNESU0zV1RkaGpyelBFUWlNR0pJTF9UWDVHZ1NidGRaWlpNSXN4R3dWUEkwTmVTRjlCUFR2Q1ZrVTlGUVR5M1Vwcmo00gGoAUFVX3lxTE93eXRKeHJYSDhPQVhULUN1OEdPdzNydTVkWTd3UkMxR3RvdVp0clVBVjhreFpzdjVkaUFXaEtWcGllaGlmS0tsN19pZk9BUGdyckxEM1VBNDF3cnJ3VzhpRW5MUzZpc0Z6YnkxbWlkcGhsV01pZnhwdFdWdTRsM3VLQW4tcEZhRldoNVFQNW9EcGw0Y3ZCUGJUYXdDNGxqRHZoRFRpWTBkZw</guid></item><item><title>病毒性韩国饮食有望在短短4周内快速减肥。以下是它的运作方式-《印度斯坦时报》 | Viral Korean diet promises rapid fat loss in just 4 weeks.

In the next four days, participants may consume fish, chicken, pork, eggs, or low-fat beef, while flour, dairy, and coffee aren't permitted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Week 2 - Intermittent Fasting&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second week, participants are required to fast for one day for 24 hours. The fast should be broken with a high-protein dinner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next set of food intake includes a daily lineup of two protein shakes, low-carb meals including rice, vegetables for lunch, and a no-carb dinner, high protein dinner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nuts, white rice, legumes, and a cup of black coffee. As muscle recovery is the main aim, high-intensity workouts are to be avoided on fast days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Weeks 3 and 4 - Emphasise Fat burn&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last two weeks involve extended fasting periods to enhance fat burn. In Week 3, two non-consecutive 24-hour fasting periods are to be followed, and in the fourth week, three are required. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two shakes a day and two low-carb meals, including pumpkins, cherry tomatoes, chestnuts, and berries, are to be consumed. However, carb-dense foods like sweet potatoes and bananas are good for post-exercise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Maintenance &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after the program is finished, participants must maintain their results with a 24-hour fast and a 14-hour fast window once a week.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Hindustan Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 25 Apr 2025 17:28:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5gFBVV95cUxOM3RJQzJ2UlBfOTZ3eWE3d3FUVEFONGNHU0ZuZkc4UlNhOEZNNjVQQmpjSnZKTmUtNnF5dlBVczRDNzNRaUFoeG1GOGdVdkgxRjJGR1ZQYjFmOFFMSEFtUmhTYUJDVGZNUjNGNUJSRnlDUDJqZnZmOXhVV0lzaFJMbzl0SXZZRmFuM2lpNnhGU0prcFRYZ09DTUVkb1RsYTVBS2dzcDhCd0ROeU8xM2N0R2NPOU5PMnc3eVFRNC1xeWVXMTVwQzlnTFdNYmNBMl91Yi10UGJ0d3JGeTlxOGVnb2I0S2p2dw</guid></item></channel></rss>
