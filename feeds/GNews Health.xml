And yet, stomachaches are not typically a sign of this rare form of cancer at any point in its progression. Instead, the most common feature of the early stages of stomach cancer is that there are no symptoms at all, said &lt;a href="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Umut Sarpel, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Umut Sarpel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of surgical oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all get stomachaches from time to time, and that can make people worry about stomach cancer," Dr. Sarpel said. "But it's not one of the most common cancers, and in most cases, stomachaches or pain are not going to be the result of cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: &lt;a href="https://findadoc.bidmc.org/details/5623/umut-sarpel-surgery-boston" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Umut Sarpel, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Umut Sarpel, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, the chief of the division of surgical oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the signs of stomach cancer? When it causes any, they are typically one of these six digestive problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There is blood in your vomit or stool.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both colitis and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a26024642/crohns-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Crohn's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; can cause bloody stool, it can also be a sign of cancer. Regardless, blood in either your poop or your vomit demands a visit to a GI doctor, Dr. Sarpel said. If the bleeding is related to cancer, the blood in your stool is likely to look maroon or tarry black. "It looks that way because it's been acted on by your digestive enzymes," she explained. If the blood is in your vomit, it's more likely to look bright red, and it may have a coarse "coffee grounds" texture because it has been partially digested, Dr. Sarpel added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You feel full after just a few bites.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were definitely hungry when you sat down to eat. But after a few bites, your appetite vanishes and the food isn't appealing. Dr. Sarpel called this "early satiety," and says it's another symptom that could—emphasis on &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt;—indicate stomach cancer. "Especially if feeling full really quickly is different than what you're used to, that's something you shouldn't ignore," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You have constant, gnawing stomach pain.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, in some cases stomach pain is a sign of stomach cancer. But in most cases, your run-of-the-mill pain or stomach cramps are going to be the result of some other gut or abdominal ailment, not cancer, Dr. Sarpel said. If it is a result of cancer, the pain will be a consistent gnawing in the middle of your stomach, she added. "It's not something you feel for one day, and then it goes away for two weeks and comes back again." &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You lost weight without trying.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many health conditions—including &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65158472/new-treatment-type-1-diabetes-cure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 1 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, Addison's disease, and Crohn's disease—can lead to unexplained weight loss. Add stomach cancer to that list, Dr. Sarpel said. "If you're losing weight and not dieting, that's something to pay attention to," she explained. Be aware that the weight loss may be gradual. While you may not notice a sudden drop, you might step on a scale and find you've lost 10 pounds during the last 6 months. It is totally natural for your weight to fluctuate, but if the weight loss is noticeable and you haven't been doing anything that accounts for it, talk with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You have frequent, unexplained heartburn.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a39761688/heartburn-relief/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heartburn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heartburn&lt;/a&gt;, indigestion, and other common symptoms of an unhappy gut can also be early warning signs of stomach cancer, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancer-types/stomach-cancer/stomach-cancer-symptoms.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Again, Dr. Sarpel said these sorts of symptoms are much more likely to be something &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than cancer. But it’s still a good idea to let your doctor know what’s going on, especially if they are constant and don't seem to be caused by consumption of specific foods and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You experience regular bloating, diarrhea, and constipation.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It makes sense that a cancer growing in your stomach could make you feel bloated, or mess with your bowel movements. While each of these symptoms is never going to scream "stomach cancer!" to a doctor, experiencing them with some of the other issues on this list—especially if you have other &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/stomach-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stomach cancer risk factors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stomach cancer risk factors&lt;/a&gt;, like being over 60, being overweight or obese, having a history of smoking, or having had stomach surgery in the past—could lead to cancer-related follow-up testing if your doctor can't pinpoint another explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 14:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTFBXMEtXSV9NbmN0cHJ0aHhrUEliWHFHMFdlcGI5alZKXzhNNGxKbkR1V0RWLXdCU0thdzFLSzA1S21GNG9xNjhOTWtoR2NSU1lmNW1nRmRfQnY4TG9vTjNKQkNMSVJSS19aMjctZ2g2MGk2YzI5bG1xeQ</guid></item><item><title>一种鲜为人知的不孕症治疗方法使白宫的试管婴儿计划复杂化- NBC新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxQRUYxekYxN0JTVzQyNk1aT0U0Wkk5YlJkcDlXeE0ySWNmYlZjTldCNkp1WXhMeksyUDFDZmNWcGxLN0g2aDg4d1MwcjFZY0dmUWdrRGtCNDV1eXAxdEpoWDhpbzFOUldtV2hqUVRPc0JiSXdwX2dJVC1PRkEzZFM1SDlJc1hHRGNTbFZGZ1VmZlh3RDRGT2JhRXRaN09MdFFzV1FwTmx4M0pCVTlfc0NDZFhqVFYzcXg4bjNLOExad9IBVkFVX3lxTFBHVTZoYVA5OWFxbldobG1rSUtLMFNUcTZxZDN1TVJFWkJLSlVZQzRWTy1CN2xZWl9aMWp2WGhUa1l0YlRUeDJPbUVuZElnekZwT092VDhR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-00ae87" class="body-graf"&gt;President Donald Trump has nicknamed himself “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-touts-ivf-expansion-calls-himself-fertilization-president-at-women-s-event-235451973833" target="_blank"&gt;the fertilization president&lt;/a&gt;,” but six months after he formally &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-wants-make-ivf-treatments-paid-government-insurance-compani-rcna168804" target="_blank"&gt;pledged to expand access&lt;/a&gt; to in vitro fertilization, the White House has yet to issue a policy to that end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2806fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Since he campaigned on the issue last year, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/advocates-wait-results-trumps-executive-order-ivf-policy-rcna207772" target="_blank"&gt;Trump’s push to support IVF&lt;/a&gt; has been complicated by backlash from conservatives and anti-abortion groups who see IVF as unethical, as well as members of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement who view the pharmaceutical industry as having undue influence over fertility care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-98eaf9" class="body-graf"&gt;Many of these groups have instead suggested that Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cathmed.org/resources/cma-calls-trump-administration-to-promote-restorative-reproductive-medicine-instead-of-ivf/" target="_blank"&gt;redirect his attention&lt;/a&gt; to a little-known holistic approach called restorative reproductive medicine. The underlying philosophy is that doctors can identify and treat the root causes of infertility, often with less invasive and more affordable methods than IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e3993" class="body-graf"&gt;But restorative reproductive medicine isn’t formally recognized as a medical specialty in the U.S. and has not been evaluated as extensively as IVF has. Many fertility doctors worry that holistic methods are being presented to patients as a better alternative to IVF, thereby denying patients access to a proven option in fertility care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e39843" class="body-graf"&gt;“Restorative approaches may work for certain patients, but elevating them as morally superior or universally preferable undermines the individualized, evidence-based care modern reproductive medicine is built on,” said Dr. Brian Levine, the founding partner of CCRM Fertility of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-e7e26c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250219-Trump-aa-1059-2742b2.jpg" alt="President Trump Signs Executive Orders At Mar-a-Lago In Palm Beach, Florida"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;President Donald Trump delivers remarks after signing an executive order on access to IVF at Mar-a-Lago on Feb. 18,  in Palm Beach, Fla.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Joe Raedle / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b2ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;After Trump issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/expanding-access-to-in-vitro-fertilization/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; in February promising to make IVF more affordable and attainable, Republican lawmakers introduced companion bills in the House and Senate that would expand access to restorative reproductive medicine and prohibit discrimination against providers who don’t offer IVF. And in June, Arkansas became the first state to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/05/infertility-treatment-restorative-reproductive-medicine-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;require insurance companies&lt;/a&gt; to cover restorative reproductive medicine treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e94159" class="body-graf"&gt;Recent actions out of the Department of Health and Human Services suggest an aligned interest in holistic fertility methods. Calley Means, a special government employee at HHS, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6371907617112" target="_blank"&gt;told Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in April that there was a “mandate from the top” to come up with “a holistic fertility policy.” That same month, HHS &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdcs-ivf-team-gutted-even-trump-calls-fertilization-president-rcna199261" target="_blank"&gt;laid off the team&lt;/a&gt; responsible for tracking IVF success rates as part of the agency’s massive restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2b48f7" class="body-graf"&gt;Then in July, HHS &lt;a href="https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/359991" target="_blank"&gt;posted a grant opportunity&lt;/a&gt; for an “infertility training center” that would educate people on a “broad range of holistic infertility treatments.” The proposed center would draw from federal Title X funds, which have historically been used to provide birth control or testing for sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ec01a" class="body-graf"&gt;Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for HHS, said the agency released a forecast for a future funding opportunity but is not currently soliciting applications for an infertility training center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bd9eec" class="body-graf"&gt;“HHS is committed to prioritizing helping couples suffering from infertility,” Nixon said, pointing to Trump’s executive order on IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c3a96" class="body-graf"&gt;Some IVF supporters say they sense indecision within the Trump administration over how to proceed with a federal policy, despite the president calling himself the “&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-says-father-ivf-recently-learned-rcna175940" target="_blank"&gt;father of IVF&lt;/a&gt;.” (Decades of research laid the foundation for IVF, but the first successful IVF pregnancy took place in England in 1978.)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-b86cbf"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250228-IVF-aa-1033-4e7f02.jpg" alt="Doctors hands removing embryo samples from cryogenic storage"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Doctors hands removing embryo samples from cryogenic storage, Fertilized embryos are stored in liquid nitrogen filled tanks to keep them as new if patients require them at a later date. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Universal Images Group / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c48fa" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House Domestic Policy Council, which advises the president on domestic issues, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ivf-recommendations-fertility-clinic-bombing-1e7a626e88d7d7a120b0c4a7ba6f8314" target="_blank"&gt;presented Trump with policy recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for supporting IVF in May. Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, an adviser to that council and a fertility specialist at Texas Fertility Center, said he recommended to White House officials that they declare infertility an essential health benefit under the Affordable Care Act and cover IVF services for military and government employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14abad" class="body-graf"&gt;But The Washington Post &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/08/03/trump-administration-ivf-care/" target="_blank"&gt;reported Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that the White House does not plan to require health insurers to cover IVF services, a policy Trump previously said he would implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ca500f" class="body-graf"&gt;Silverberg said White House officials haven’t told him which policies they favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d300f4" class="body-graf"&gt;“They come at me with very insightful questions, but they don’t give me anything,” he said. “If I say to them, ‘Hey, what are you thinking about such and such?’ The pat answer that I get back is, ‘Well, we’re listening to lots of different sources, and we’re trying to formulate the best solutions that we can.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5438b" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House said it has met with stakeholders across the spectrum to solicit their input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-742d81" class="body-graf"&gt;“President Trump pledged to expand IVF access for Americans looking to start families, and the Administration remains committed to delivering on that pledge and exploring all options that address the root causes of infertility,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3eb9af" class="body-graf"&gt;Restorative reproductive medicine may indeed be one of those options. The International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, the professional association for doctors who offer this type of fertility care, has spoken with federal officials about its methods, said Dr. Tracey Parnell, the institute’s global director of communications and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c454f1" class="body-graf"&gt;Parnell, who is Canadian, coined the term “restorative reproductive medicine” in the late 1990s alongside a small group of international physicians. She was surprised earlier this year when her community became part of the national conversation in the U.S., she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2cb5ce" class="body-graf"&gt;“We were sort of expecting another decade to be able to get to the stage of more published information and further along the pathway to formal recognition as a specialty,” Parnell said, noting that such recognition in the U.S. requires accreditation by a national board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-563af9" class="body-graf"&gt;One group responsible for increasing the visibility of restorative reproductive medicine is the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank whose policy proposals are known to influence the White House’s agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23e49c" class="body-graf"&gt;In March, the foundation &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/report/treating-infertility-the-new-frontier-reproductive-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; highlighting what it said are the benefits of restorative reproductive medicine over a fertility industry that “profits from the creation and selection of human life.” The report emboldened groups that are morally or ideologically opposed to IVF, said Levine, of CCRM Fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-47625d"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1466" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250807-IVF-aa-505-ad50ed.jpg" alt="House Democrats Holds Press Conference On World IVF Day"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;People hold signs in honor of World IVF Day in Washington, D.C., in 2024. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Tierney L.

Kennedy Jr., also favor holistic methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-72efc0" class="body-graf"&gt;In late June, the Heritage Foundation and the MAHA Institute — a policy center that backs initiatives that align with the MAHA movement — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhlr3aVJKOQ" target="_blank"&gt;held a roundtable discussion&lt;/a&gt; on women’s fertility. Many of the speakers there advocated for restorative reproductive medicine and warned of the risks of hormonal birth control. At least one high-powered federal official, the Food and Drug Administration’s principal deputy commissioner, Sara Brenner, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apRJ9RpdTDc&amp;amp;t=151s" target="_blank"&gt;was in attendance&lt;/a&gt; and expressed support for the topics discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6c34b4" class="body-graf"&gt;“The goals of the Make America Health Again movement — to return to holistic, root-cause medical care for men and women — align with the goals and approach of restorative reproductive medicine, even if there are notable differences and distinctions between those two movements,” said Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f98f96" class="body-graf"&gt;Parnell, of the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said the group’s methods don’t prevent people from pursuing IVF, but rather give them options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d812b8" class="body-graf"&gt;Practitioners of restorative reproductive medicine say their methods are individualized to the patient and don’t rush to diagnose women with infertility if they can’t conceive right away. They often ask patients to carefully track their menstrual cycles, body temperature and changes in cervical mucus to help determine when they’re ovulating. They also look to diagnose and treat medical conditions that may impact fertility, such as polycystic ovary syndrome or endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54d901" class="body-graf"&gt;Where necessary, practitioners may suggest changes to patients’ diets, recommend vitamins or supplements or prescribe hormone medications that improve ovulation. In some cases, they may advise surgery to diagnose endometriosis and remove scar tissue that can block an egg’s path to the uterus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7cee8e" class="body-graf"&gt;But IVF doctors said the restorative approach can take time&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; which some patients may not have if they have a diminished number or quality of eggs. Many of the tactics of restorative reproductive medicine, like prescribing hormones or dietary changes, are already used in fertility clinics nationwide, they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7af863" class="body-graf"&gt;Silverberg, of Texas Fertility Center, said restorative reproductive medicine is “a made-up term for something that’s been going on for decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-adc35f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My concern is that the people who focus solely on restorative reproductive health want things to stop right there. They unfortunately advocate ignoring all of the medical advances that have happened in the last 40 years,” Silverberg said, adding that he shared these thoughts with White House officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fb1b25" class="body-graf"&gt;Monica Minjeur, the U.S. director of communications and development for the International Institute for Restorative Reproductive Medicine, said there is data to show that the approach works. In a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/medicine/articles/10.3389/fmed.2018.00210/full" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of more than 400 women with a history of infertility, most of whom had been unsuccessful with IVF, roughly 32% gave birth after turning to restorative reproductive medicine. The odds of having a child via an additional cycle of IVF were roughly the same, according to the paper, which Parnell co-authored. (The average &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4934614/" target="_blank"&gt;success rate of a woman’s first IVF cycle&lt;/a&gt; is around 30%.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-398e54" class="body-graf"&gt;Despite its conservative fan base, Minjeur said, restorative reproductive medicine is not inherently political or religious, and her organization is cautious about these associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5e17a9" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are a science-based medical organization who is trying to just get the good word out to the people,” she said. “If and where that aligns with government priorities to help people who want to build families, great, we’ll take it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 08 Aug 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQRUYxekYxN0JTVzQyNk1aT0U0Wkk5YlJkcDlXeE0ySWNmYlZjTldCNkp1WXhMeksyUDFDZmNWcGxLN0g2aDg4d1MwcjFZY0dmUWdrRGtCNDV1eXAxdEpoWDhpbzFOUldtV2hqUVRPc0JiSXdwX2dJVC1PRkEzZFM1SDlJc1hHRGNTbFZGZ1VmZlh3RDRGT2JhRXRaN09MdFFzV1FwTmx4M0pCVTlfc0NDZFhqVFYzcXg4bjNLOExad9IBVkFVX3lxTFBHVTZoYVA5OWFxbldobG1rSUtLMFNUcTZxZDN1TVJFWkJLSlVZQzRWTy1CN2xZWl9aMWp2WGhUa1l0YlRUeDJPbUVuZElnekZwT092VDhR</guid></item><item><title>具有基因编辑细胞的糖尿病患者自行生产胰岛素-无需移植药物- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivAFBVV95cUxNRnZCcWIxSXBlaU54SG5zbVdib3RuOUxrM1lVMncwT1N5RldSdi13Ynk0WUwtVmtHYVlxLW1tZEhwMFFQb2I0OEpHU2U2OGhzZWtWckdKaDMxa1A0cU5vaXluU05lWGlCUXBhRTZqMVZMVDE1Tml4V3ZPcHdqWG80aDFBQlNPY1MxVlY0MEEzOXRVRHJJcVc3TW5Yc2ViNFAxS1lyczF4VGFDTEs5V0M4TXdnQ3VFeGE4VVNwSg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A new case study offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential future of transplantation medicine. A man with type 1 diabetes is now able to make his own insulin thanks to a transplant of gene-edited pancreatic cells—a transplant that hasn’t required the typical drugs used to avoid rejection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Sweden and the U.S. conducted the research, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2503822"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. The 42-year-old man with long-standing diabetes was given donated islet cells that were genetically modified via CRISPR to prevent immune rejection. Roughly four months after the procedure, his fully gene-edited cells have continued to produce insulin without provoking an immune response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study, although preliminary, suggests that immune evasion is an alternative concept for the circumvention of allorejection,” the authors wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with type 1 diabetes have immune systems that destroy the pancreatic cells responsible for making insulin. The condition can be managed with regular doses of synthetic insulin, but people’s health still tends to worsen over time. Recently, scientists have been studying whether donated islet cell transplants can provide a self-sustained replacement supply of insulin for type 1 diabetics—an effective cure, in other words, provided the cells can survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Early clinical trials of the technology have &lt;a href="https://news.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-presents-positive-data-zimislecel-type-1-diabetes"&gt;looked&lt;/a&gt; promising so far, but these transplants still require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy to ensure the host’s body doesn’t go after the donated cells. Effective as these drugs are, they have their well-known drawbacks, such as weakening people’s immunity to actual threats like infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers have been experimenting with a unique approach to sidestep the need for these drugs. They first tested it on mice and monkeys, with this new case being the first test in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They created three specific edits in the donated cells, all intended to quiet the most likely responses from the immune system. Two of the edits deplete the cells’ supply of HLA class I and II antigens, proteins that tell our T cells whether another cell is foreign or not. A third edit causes the donated cells to make more of another protein called CD47 that inhibits the activity of other immune cells that would normally target them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers injected the modified cells into the man’s forearm. The edits weren’t completely successful in some of the cells, and the man’s immune system quickly killed off these cells. But as hoped, his body left the fully edited cells alone, even without immunosuppressants. The surviving cells produced insulin as normal, and the man appeared to be doing well 12 weeks later. He did experience several adverse events, but none were serious or linked to the transplanted cells themselves (he had mildly inflamed veins where a catheter was placed, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This study is only a proof of concept, geared more at showing the procedure can be done safely than at proving it actually works. The man was given a relatively low dose of the donated cells, likely too low for his body to produce enough insulin on its own to no longer need treatment. Follow-up is also needed to know whether these cells can survive long-term.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s much to be encouraged about. And it’s the latest sign that scientists are truly on the verge of making type 1 diabetes curable. Other research teams have shown early success in using similar transplants to cure the condition, including some that have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/in-medical-first-womans-type-1-diabetes-seemingly-cured-by-stem-cells-2000506407"&gt;also avoided needing&lt;/a&gt; immunosuppressant therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Florida has seen 16 cases this year, according to the state’s health department. &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/vibrio-vulnificus-2025" target="_blank"&gt;Seventeen cases have been reported in Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; — more than previous years’ annual averages. North Carolina has seen seven cases this year so far, the state Department of Health and Human Services confirmed to NBC News. And Mississippi has had three cases so far this year, the state’s health department says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4e1578" class="body-graf"&gt;Initial deaths from the infection in Florida were reported in counties spread around the state’s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in Southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d2b49" class="body-graf"&gt;The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt; People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It’s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-63a2b5" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70793b" class="body-graf"&gt;Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida, said that infections are still rare but “something is off this year.” Still, he said there are too many unknowns to be certain what's causing the rise in infections at this time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e2f9dc" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is certainly not normal, that’s one thing,” Jutla said. “We haven’t had that many cases early on in the summer for a very long time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-658b95" class="body-graf"&gt;Jutla said Vibrio vulnificus infections tend to increase after hurricanes. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/hurricanes/hurricane-season-ends-rcna181808" target="_blank"&gt;“extremely active” hurricane season. &lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hurricane-idalia-concerns-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna102181" target="_blank"&gt;bacteria can linger&lt;/a&gt; in hurricane floodwaters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74b11d" class="body-graf"&gt;“Something happened this year that triggered the pathogens a little bit more than before,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-44b37a" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/prediction-remains-on-track-for-above-normal-atlantic-hurricane-season" target="_blank"&gt;Hurricane season this year&lt;/a&gt; is still expected to be above normal as the U.S. enters its peak period, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d5e444" class="body-graf"&gt;Jutla’s research group is investigating why there are high concentrations of plankton and chlorophyll — indicators for vibrio — across Florida’s panhandle. He calls it a “concern.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-509d8f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vibrio vulnificus? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c5f2e3" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is one of over 200 species of Vibrio bacteria, said Rita Colwell, a professor emerita of microbiology at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84ef02" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of Vibrio infections aren’t harmful to humans, Jutla said. Some only affect other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6854d5" class="body-graf"&gt;But Vibrio bacteria do cause about 80,000 infections in people each year, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Most of those cases are gastrointestinal. Only a small handful — 100 to 200 cases — are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3aeee6" class="body-graf"&gt;Because Vibrio bacteria prefer warm water, they are typically found along the southeastern shores of the U.S., but they are also found on the West Coast. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;As ocean temperatures warm&lt;/a&gt;, more cases have been found farther north in recent years, Jutla said, including some in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/3-people-die-flesh-eating-bacteria-infections-new-york-connecticut-pro-rcna100364" target="_blank"&gt;New York, Connecticut and Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b78964" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fd93ce" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio bacteria can creep in open wounds after spending time in salty or brackish water, said Dr. Norman Beatty, an infectious disease doctor at University of Florida Health. Most cases he’s seen have been associated with spending extended time in the water, but he says that even a brief exposure could be the “only thing needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5a7a11" class="body-graf"&gt;Visible signs of an infection can start in just a few hours, Beatty said, and include redness, swelling and “bull’s-eye” blisters. The site will also be painful. If infection progresses, it can get into the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can be deadly. Symptoms of sepsis include fever, chills and dangerously low blood pressure, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-18ecdc" class="body-graf"&gt;People with liver cirrhosis, weakened immune systems and those over 65 are most at risk for infection, Jutla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8a29d" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus infections can be treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5fd37e" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to prevent Vibrio infections&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a21ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;Beatty said he recommends covering up any open wounds before going into the ocean.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brain fog is that mentally fuzzy feeling that makes it difficult to think clearly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One study found it may affect nearly 30% of people. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RDs say eating leafy greens, berries, fatty fish, mushrooms and nuts may offer protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve ever walked into a room and forgotten why you entered, or spent hours searching for that one thing that you just&lt;em&gt; know &lt;/em&gt;is somewhere (but where?!), you may be suffering from brain fog. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brain fog isn’t a formal medical diagnosis per se,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wendybazilian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Wendy Bazilian, Dr.P.H., M.A., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “But many people use it to describe that frustrating feeling of mental fuzziness—when your thinking feels slower, your memory feels off [with] little mental blips or delays.” If you can relate, you’re not alone. One recent study of more than 25,000 adults found that 28% of them &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-cognitive-decline-11767736" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reported experiencing brain fog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Luckily, what you eat plays a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-eat-every-week-for-better-brain-health-11784254" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keeping your brain sharp&lt;/a&gt; and your memory in tip-top shape. To find out the foods you should be eating for better mental clarity, we dug into the research and talked to registered dietitians. Here’s what you need to know.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-dark-leafy-greens"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Dark Leafy Greens  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Time and time again, studies looking at the best foods to preserve cognition reinforce that we should be eating dark green leafy vegetables every day, if possible,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bazilian echoes the importance of eating your greens (which is why they’re at the top of our list!). Consider the results of this study, she says: “Older adults who ate just one serving of leafy greens a day experienced slower decline in memory and thinking skills compared to those who rarely ate them. In fact, the difference was so striking that their brains functioned as if they were 11 years younger.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers hypothesize that the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-as-many-antioxidants-as-green-tea-11761365" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidants in leafy greens&lt;/a&gt;, including lutein, alpha-tocopherol and kaempferol, help keep brains sharp as we age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But those antioxidants aren’t the only reason greens help keep your brain clear and sharp. “[Greens] provide folate, vitamin E, carotenoids and flavonoids, which improve the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the brain, and help address neuroinflammation that can diminish cognitive performance,” notes Moon. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are so many different ways to eat your greens, even if you think you’re not a fan. Toss them into a green smoothie, scrambled eggs, pasta or a salad. And don’t be afraid to experiment to find the ones that work for you. Kale, bok choy, collard greens, Swiss chard, spinach and arugula are all winners.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-berries"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Berries &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re feeling forgetful or fuzzy, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fruit-to-lower-dementia-risk-11777712" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;berries can help&lt;/a&gt;. Bazilian likens eating them to upgrading a processor on an old computer, where “tasks that were slow or glitchy before become smooth and responsive.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Berries are packed with brain-supporting nutrients, like fiber, vitamins, minerals and polyphenols. They are also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-antioxidant-rich-foods-you-should-eat-11776388" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; called anthocyanins that are linked to better brain health, particularly &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-improve-your-memory-8415078" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;improved memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your main brain fog symptom is feeling mentally sluggish, wild blueberries might help rev things up. In a randomized control trial of people over 65 years old with mild cognitive issues, those who consumed wild blueberry powder daily for six months experienced improvements in mental processing speed compared to those who took a placebo.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While wild blueberries have higher concentrations of anthocyanins than regular blueberries, all berries are believed to do good things for brain health. And they don’t have to be fresh to do their thing. When fresh berries are out of season, look for frozen berries and whir them into smoothies or stir them into yogurt. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-mushrooms"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Mushrooms  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may not think of mushrooms first when it comes to healthy foods to add to your diet, but these fungi are powerful. “Mushrooms are often a forgotten food in the U.S., but they deserve our attention for their potential brain-health benefits,” notes Moon. “Their bioactives may lower inflammation and oxidative stress common to mental fatigue.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research has linked mushroom consumption with cognitive performance, including &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/top-mistakes-to-avoid-for-cognitive-health-11779797" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better memory and executive function&lt;/a&gt; among middle-aged and older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In addition, a culturally adapted version of the MIND diet that includes several weekly servings of mushrooms has been associated with better cognitive function in observational studies, adds Moon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, different mushrooms have different nutrients and bioactive compounds. So, aim to eat a variety of your favorite mushrooms a few times a week. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-walnuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Walnuts  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “There are dozens of individual studies on cognition and walnut consumption, and the science suggests a positive relationship between nut intake and cognitive performance,” says Bazilian. This is likely due to walnuts’ plant omega-3s in the form of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) plus antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t just eat walnuts to sharpen your brain today. Longer-term, walnuts may also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7909431/have-a-family-history-of-dementia-or-alzheimers-heres-how-to-protect-your-brain-as-you-age/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;decrease the risk of developing brain disorders&lt;/a&gt; like Parkinson’s disease, depression and stroke. Research finds that eating 1 to 2 ounces per day may help improve cognitive function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, they’re a tasty, convenient snack. But walnuts are also a fantastic way to add a healthy crunch to yogurt, oatmeal, energy bites, salads, pasta and more.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not surprising to see &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-fish-regularly-8677271" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fatty fish like salmon and sardines&lt;/a&gt; on a list of the best foods to prevent brain fog. Fatty fish deliver &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-for-brain-health-as-you-age-11739345" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DHA and EPA&lt;/a&gt;, long-chain omega-3 fats that may improve learning, memory and overall well-being by increasing blood flow to the brain.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Neurons need omega-3s like we need good cell service—it makes a big difference in how well they can connect and work together,” explains Moon. “Omega-3s also have anti-inflammatory properties the brain needs to recover from daily wear and tear or other stressors that may contribute to brain fog.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon’s pick? Sardines. “Sardines are low on the food chain for sustainability, but high in omega-3s for brain health.” Other &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-types-of-fish-for-brain-health-8609071" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt; include salmon, mackerel, herring and anchovies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While technically not a food (we know, we know), water is so important for your brain. “Mild dehydration is directly linked to having a hard time focusing, thinking, learning and remembering,” says Moon. The result, she says, is that hungover, foggy feeling that makes it difficult to think straight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The impact of dehydration is so profound that one study of older adults found that poor hydration increased their risk of cognitive decline. Conversely, additional research has linked hydration to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-in-the-morning-for-better-cognitive-function-11689092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;better cognitive performance on tests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If drinking enough water feels like a challenge, Moon says all forms of fluid work. Whether it’s coffee, green tea, 100% orange juice, cucumbers, watermelon, grapes or tomatoes, there are lots of foods and drinks that can help you get the fluids you need to stay on the ball.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have brain fog, you’ll be happy to know that there are foods that may help you think more clearly. Research has shown that leafy greens, berries, mushrooms, walnuts and fatty fish can all help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keep your brain in top shape&lt;/a&gt;. While these foods aren’t magic, including them in a healthy eating plan may help keep your brain sharper, faster and less foggy. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A healthy diet is like your brain’s personal assistant, giving it all the nutrients it needs to perform its best,” says Moon. “What we eat can be just as important as what we limit, so that we aren’t overburdening the brain with additional metabolic stress that can exacerbate brain fog.” In addition to loading up on these brain-supporting foods, try to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7911108/best-and-worst-foods-for-brain-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;limit foods and ingredients linked to poorer brain health&lt;/a&gt;, like added sugars, refined grains, alcohol and saturated fats. And don’t underestimate the power of hydration, as dehydration can mess with learning and memory. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  While you’re at it, why not keep your brain in top shape in other ways? Getting enough sleep, moving your body and limiting stress (to the best of your ability!) can also keep your brain on top of its game. Then, get ready to say bye-bye brain fog and hello mental clarity.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) enforced the same guidance in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;There was a 50% relative increase in colorectal cancer diagnoses in people aged 45 to 49 from 2021 to 2022, researchers found.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), the researchers analyzed &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/health-care" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CRC diagnoses;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CRC diagnoses&lt;/a&gt; from 2004 to 2022 among adults aged 20 to 54, sorted by age, location and stage at diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/western-diet-blamed-growing-risk-gi-cancers-among-young-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:'Western Diet' Blamed For Growing Risk Of Gi Cancers Among Young Adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Western Diet' Blamed For Growing Risk Of Gi Cancers Among Young Adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses have increased by 1.6% each year since 2004 in the 20 to 39 age group, and by more than 2% annually since 2012 in those aged 40 to 44 and 50 to 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 1.1% annual increase in people 45 to 49 years old accelerated to 12% per year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Individuals in their late 40s had a 19% increase in local-stage colon cancer detection each year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACS confirmed the increase was driven by the detection of local-stage tumors, which increased by nearly 19% each year for colon cancer and more than 25% for rectal cancer in that timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before this period, colon cancer detection rates had been stable, and rectal cancer detection rates had been declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/rare-cancer-diagnoses-surge-dramatically-among-millennials-gen-x" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rare Cancer Diagnoses Surge Dramatically Among Millennials And Gen X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rare Cancer Diagnoses Surge Dramatically Among Millennials And Gen X&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced-stage disease also continues to steeply increase, ACS reported, rising from 1.7% to 2.9% annually since 2004 among adults under 45 and "even more rapidly" in the past 10 years in those aged 45 to 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings led to another ACS study, also published in JAMA, which found that CRC screening among U.S. adults between 45 and 49 increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists analyzed the data of more than 50,000 individuals to compare changes in screening. They found that CRC screening, which was at 20% in 2021, jumped to 37% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 45- to 49-year-olds, colonoscopy screening increased by 43%, and stool-based testing increased more than five times from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Jessica Star, associate scientist at ACS in Atlanta, considers it "thrilling" to see this increase in screening among younger individuals, as it's likely linked to earlier-stage diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we still have a long way to go," she said in the release. "Screening for colorectal cancer in ages 45 to 49 remains suboptimal, and has not increased equitably by both educational attainment and insurance status."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;The study findings support efforts for everyone in the 45 to 49 age group to have access to screening.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul E. Oberstein, M.D., medical oncologist and assistant director of the Pancreatic Cancer Center at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center, said the increase in screening is "successful in detecting more cancers at an early stage where the chance of cure is very high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This ultimately should mean that fewer people are diagnosed later in life and fewer people have advanced colon cancer," Oberstein, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study reinforces the need to focus research on understanding the causes of colon cancer increases – and possible steps to reduce these cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Individuals of all ages should contact a doctor if colorectal cancer symptoms arise, an oncologist said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of colon cancer in those under 45 remains "substantially lower," he noted, "so it is not clear yet if universal screening at a younger age is beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some specific patients who are younger than 45 may benefit from earlier screening, however, such as those with a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/genetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:family history;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt; or personal risk factors, the oncologist added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/exercise-program-reduces-common-cancer-recurrence-boosts-survival" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exercise Program Reduces Common Cancer Recurrence And Boosts Survival;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Program Reduces Common Cancer Recurrence And Boosts Survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As colon cancer continues to increase in younger individuals, Oberstein recommends contacting a doctor if any concerning symptoms are noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Craig Eagle, chief medical officer of Guardant Health in California, added that early detection is "crucial," noting that the five-year survival rate for CRC is over 90% when the disease is caught in early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[This] plummets to 13% in late stages when symptoms usually appear," Eagle, who also was not involved in the research, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rise in diagnoses for those in their 40s is an alarming reminder that screening must be easier and more accessible to reach the 50 million Americans who remain unscreened."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cache Creek Casino Resort, a 659-room luxury hotel featuring legal gambling in the unincorporated community of Brooks, issued the statement in collaboration with the Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the statement, officials said casino staff “are conducting contact tracing to identify and notify individuals who may have had close contact with the affected person. Health authorities define close contact as having a cumulative exposure of at least eight hours to the individual with (tuberculosis).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; said the tuberculosis bacteria can be spread through coughing, sneezing or speaking with others nearby. Coughs that last three weeks or longer, chest pain, and coughing up blood all are symptoms of the infection, the agency said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, appetite loss, chills, fever and night sweats. The CDCP also said many people who catch the bacteria for tuberculosis never show symptoms and have an “inactive infection” that is not contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The casino urged employees and those who have stayed at the resort in the past three months to contact their health care provider. They said that urgency is even higher for people with a compromised immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials did not say how they came to find out about the exposure or when it happened. A message left for the casino on Thursday was not returned immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health on &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/TBCB.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; said 2,100 people caught tuberculosis in California last year, 10 fewer than in 2023. Twenty-six of those cases were children under 5 years old.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the state’s annual incidence rate of 5.4 cases per 100,000 persons is nearly double the national rate, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;

Once the mosquito population surges, it takes just one infected traveler from India or Thailand to kickstart local transmission. We’ve seen similar patterns in France, Italy, and now in Florida, where U.S. officials are reporting dengue cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bt5ca-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Leshem added that China has implemented a wide range of response strategies. “These include conventional tactics like spraying insecticides, draining standing water, using mosquito nets, and applying repellents. But in typical Chinese fashion, there are also strict public health enforcement measures: people face hefty fines for keeping water-filled flower pots, mosquito-eating fish are being released into ponds, and in some cases, patients are being hospitalized against their will.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5kh4l-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;While the risk of a similar outbreak in Israel is currently low, Prof. Leshem cautioned that it’s not out of the question. “We know these types of mosquitoes are present in Israel, and from time to time, we do identify chikungunya cases. It’s certainly a possibility, as we saw with last year’s West Nile virus outbreak.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6k2dk-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Chikungunya is spread by infected Aedes mosquitoes—the same species responsible for transmitting dengue and Zika viruses.

Businesses that fail to take mosquito-control measures face fines of up to 1,000 yuan (about $140 USD).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="du57g-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="du57g-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="du57g-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a travel advisory urging caution when visiting affected areas in southern China, as well as Bolivia and islands in the Indian Ocean.

Chinese health authorities maintain that the disease is “preventable, controllable, and treatable.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ciprg" data-offset-key="9bi1u-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="9bi1u-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="9bi1u-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Unlike COVID-19, chikungunya is not spread from person to person, but only through bites from infected mosquitoes.

                            &lt;p&gt;What is most fascinating about Ozempic isn’t the weight loss. It’s the psychological revolution it has triggered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something extraordinary is happening to people who’ve spent years, even decades, locked in a mental war with food. Again and again, I hear the same phrase from the medicalised weight-loss army: the “food noise” has stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when the jabs stop? &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/ozempic-patients-need-support-for-a-year-after-treatment-xhh9fhsp8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;A recent report&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; suggested that patients may need a full year of support after coming off Ozempic. I’d say that’s the bare minimum. Because once the food noise returns, so does the weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some patients plan to taper off gradually, while others hope to stay on a maintenance dose indefinitely. But for many, going off the drug brings a risk of “Ozempic rebound” — the return of weight and cravings. Sustaining weight loss typically requires lasting lifestyle changes, as most users report a surge in appetite once the injections stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet there are also accounts from people who say their cravings never returned, even after discontinuing the medication. If true, this raises a critical question: are these drugs doing more than suppressing appetite in the short term? Could they be reshaping long-term behaviour and not just altering brain chemistry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some slim people seem oddly irked by Ozempic. We’ve long treated body weight as a reflection of character. Thinness is seen as discipline, virtue, self-control. Obesity is framed as a moral failure — greedy, lazy, slobbish. Katie Hopkins once &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/british-tv-personality-katie-hopkins-gained-lost-weight/story?id=28216895" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;tried&lt;/a&gt; to prove how easy it is to lose weight by deliberately gaining it. She had to force herself to eat, found the whole process unpleasant and difficult, and eventually, after much effort, she gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for a whole cohort of people, the reverse is true. They live in a near-constant state of hunger, tormented by a 24/7 food soundtrack. And still the weight piles on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ozempic challenges this old narrative. Suddenly, it’s not about willpower or virtue — it’s about biology. And the implications go far beyond individual weight loss. The potential public health benefits are huge: lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, and even some obesity-related cancers. This could be the next statin or thalidomide. We don’t know yet, which is why we need to think very carefully about how we are using these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s because we still have no quality research to show what happens in the long term. And already, serious concerns are emerging. The &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6jg6nw2zeo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of North Lanarkshire nurse Susan McGowan, 58, last September is believed to be the first in the UK officially linked to weight-loss medication. And across the country, regulators have now received &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2025/jun/concerns-grow-as-slimming-injections-tied-to-more-than-100-uk-fatalities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of more than 100 deaths potentially linked to drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro — though these cases remain unconfirmed and may involve other contributing health factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also countless reports of people self-medicating online. Singer Avery &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFVjSc5pUjJ/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently revealed&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram that she developed osteoporosis at 30 after taking a weight-loss drug without a prescription. “I DO have an eating disorder, and I did NOT get Ozempic from a doctor. It is very easy to get,” she said.  Online self-medication isn’t new. What’s new is how easy it has become, and how little scrutiny there seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real question now is not just what happens next, but how we support people when the drugs wear off, stop working, or begin to cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="midcontent3" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                            
                                                        &lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Americans have never heard of it. But this neglected tropical disease is no longer confined to the tropics. It’s here, in the United States, spreading silently in wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chagas disease can lie dormant in the human body for years before leading to heart failure, stroke, arrhythmias, or sudden death. Once symptoms appear, the damage is often irreversible. The parasite is spread by &lt;a href="https://kissingbug.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;triatomine insects&lt;/a&gt;, also known as “kissing bugs,” which feed on the blood of infected animals like raccoons, opossums, and rodents. They defecate near the bite, and if the feces enter broken skin or mucous membranes, the parasite can infect humans. In rare cases, it has also been transmitted via organ transplant, blood transfusion, and congenital exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although Chagas disease is endemic to Latin America and a major public health concern there, it remains largely overlooked in the United States. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cme/chagas/lesson_1/7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; estimates that around 300,000 people living in the United States are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi. Many were born in endemic regions of Mexico, Central America, and South America, yet most don’t know they are infected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the popular idea that this disease only affects immigrants or travelers is dangerously outdated. My research confirms that T. cruzi is actively circulating in U.S. wildlife, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12233274/?utm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found infected kissing bugs and mammalian hosts in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7470559/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/13/4/06-1002_article?utm_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Louisiana&lt;/a&gt;, and now the &lt;a href="https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-medical-entomology/volume-62/issue-3/tjaf018/Trypanosoma-cruzi-Kinetoplastida-Trypanosomatidae-in-the-Midwest--prevalence-among/10.1093/jme/tjaf018.short?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Midwest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;While Trypanosoma cruzi in raccoons and triatomine bugs doesn’t guarantee human infection, the ecological conditions for spillover already exist, and in some cases, transmission has likely occurred. A recent review in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/14/7/901" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Life&lt;/a&gt; found about 90 confirmed or suspected locally acquired Chagas cases in the U.S. between 2000 and 2020, mostly in Texas but also in Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and California. More recently, a &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0012920" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;field study&lt;/a&gt; in Florida, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases, revealed that nearly 35% of triatomine bugs collected inside homes tested positive for T. cruzi, and 23% had fed on humans, confirming direct human-vector contact and ongoing potential for unnoticed transmission. A 2022 study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35731040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; about 10,000 locally acquired cases in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although locally acquired Chagas cases remain relatively rare in the United States, some researchers are beginning to raise concerns that could shift this dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nwdistrict.ifas.ufl.edu/phag/2021/10/01/chagas-disease-a-health-risk-for-rural-people-in-the-southeastern-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;University of Florida Extension report&lt;/a&gt; states that the risk of human contact with infected triatomine bugs may increase in areas where homes border wooded landscapes or include features like dog shelters, poultry sheds, or stacked firewood. These environments create ideal hiding spots and blood sources for the insects, raising the chances they’ll enter homes. As climate change and land development reshape ecosystems, monitoring these risk factors is critical to staying ahead of potential disease spillover.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s worse is how unprepared we are. Most doctors in the U.S. don’t consider Chagas disease in their differential diagnoses. Routine testing is nearly nonexistent. There’s no standardized national surveillance, and most infections are only discovered incidentally, such as during blood donor screening. By then, it’s often too late.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even among those familiar with Chagas, there’s a misconception that it’s rare or imported. My fieldwork contradicts that narrative. If raccoons in rural Illinois are carrying this parasite in such high numbers, what does that mean for human exposure? People living in rural and wooded areas, hunters, campers, and agricultural workers are all potentially at risk, especially as triatomine bugs expand their geographic range due to climate change and environmental shifts.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The CDC has published data and guidelines on T. cruzi, but much of the clinical community remains unaware of the disease’s domestic relevance. This knowledge gap is both preventable and dangerous. Every year we delay action, we miss opportunities for early detection, treatment, and public education.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be clear, Chagas disease is treatable if caught early. Antiparasitic medications like benznidazole can reduce parasite load and prevent progression, particularly in children and newly infected patients, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;. But we must first recognize it exists here, and test for it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution is not panic but preparation. We need:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awareness campaigns to educate clinicians and the public&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Expanded diagnostic access, especially in high-risk regions&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Targeted screening for patients with unexplained cardiac issues in endemic zones&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Continued wildlife surveillance to monitor spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My experience as a research scientist showed me that the line between neglected and recognized diseases is not biology, it’s attention. Chagas disease has all the warning signs of an emerging public health crisis: silent spread, climate-driven expansion, low awareness, and long-term health consequences. What it lacks is urgency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen this before. Covid-19, mpox, and now rising tick-borne diseases, all emerged from complex relationships between humans, wildlife, and environmental change. Trypanosoma cruzi is no different. It’s not a matter of if this becomes a bigger problem in the U.S., but how soon, and whether we will be ready. It’s time to stop underestimating Chagas disease and start treating it like the threat it truly is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Esther Onuselogu, M.Sc., is a biological sciences researcher with a focus on public health. Her thesis is on Trypanosoma cruzi infection in U.S. wildlife. She is passionate about infectious disease awareness and public health equity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;The human brain tends to slow down as we age — even healthy brains shrink. That can make learning and memory harder as people age. But some people's brains shrink more slowly than their peers. This lucky group is called "SuperAgers." They're people aged 80 or older. But they have the memory abilities of someone 50-to-60 years old. This week in the journal Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia, researchers from &lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/superaging/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Northwestern University's SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt; summarized some of the secrets they've learned in the last 2.5 decades.   &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Want to hear about more stories about human health and aging?

You may have heard a saying along the lines that “when the US sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold”. So when the US health department announced plans to cut half a billion dollars in vaccine research funding on Wednesday, the world took notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US is the &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/foundation-for-u-s-breakthroughs-feels-shakier-to-researchers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;world’s largest funder of biomedical research&lt;/a&gt;, but this position has become more precarious with the appointment of Robert F Kennedy Jr, a longtime vaccine sceptic, as US health secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"world","tags":[{"id":"world/series/first-edition","type":"Series","title":"First Edition newsletter"},{"id":"world/series/guardian-morning-briefing","type":"Series","title":"Guardian morning briefing"},{"id":"campaign/email/morning-briefing","type":"Campaign","title":"First Edition (newsletter signup)"},{"id":"us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr","type":"Keyword","title":"Robert F Kennedy Jr"},{"id":"us-news/donaldtrump","type":"Keyword","title":"Donald Trump"},{"id":"society/vaccines","type":"Keyword","title":"Vaccines and immunisation"},{"id":"world/coronavirus-outbreak","type":"Keyword","title":"Coronavirus"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","type":"Keyword","title":"US politics"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/newsletter-tone","type":"Tone","title":"Newsletters"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/aamna-mohdin","type":"Contributor","title":"Aamna Mohdin","twitterHandle":"aamnamohdin","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/01/15/Aamna-Mohdin.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=822026ccf36ea70e6b5e9b382073ed00","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/01/15/Aamna_Mohdin,_L.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=4ae99a84606629d4b99f943d0905827e"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/newsletters","type":"Tracking","title":"Newsletters"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"world/2025/aug/08/friday-briefing-what-will-us-funding-cuts-on-mrna-vaccines-mean-for-the-health-of-the-world","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This week, Kennedy has announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/rfk-jr-hhs-mrna-vaccine-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;terminate 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, casting doubt on the safety of a technology widely credited with helping end the Covid-19 pandemic and saving millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In total the affected projects are worth nearly $500m (£376m), according to the health agency. As for Kennedy, he said: “We reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The only problem? The scientific community in the US and around the world has overwhelmingly condemned the decision. To understand why, for today’s newsletter I spoke to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Head&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a global health researcher at the University of Southampton. That’s after the headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="five-big-stories" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Five big stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Israel-Gaza war &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/israel-cabinet-approves-netanyahu-gaza-city-takeover-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;his security cabinet had approved a plan to take over Gaza City&lt;/a&gt; after the prime minister earlier said Israel planned to take full control of the Palestinian territory. The decision early on Friday marks another escalation of Israel’s offensive in Gaza. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/08/israel-gaza-city-take-over-netanyahu-plan-approved-live-updates-latest-news" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Follow developments live&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukraine &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of an expected meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin that &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/08/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-rallies-europe-allies-before-trump-putin-meeting" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Europe must participate in the peace process&lt;/a&gt; between Ukraine and Russia. As the Kremlin refused a three-way meeting with Zelenskyy and Trump, the Ukrainian president said: “Ukraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same brave approach from the Russian side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economy &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The chancellor and prime minister will begin to foreshadow tax rises and reforms from September to prepare the country for a difficult budget that could be held in November, the Guardian has been told. A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/07/reeves-starmer-pitch-roll-tax-rises-advance-difficult-budget" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rise in gambling levies – advocated by Gordon Brown &lt;/a&gt;– is thought to be near-guaranteed as part of the package of tax rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UK news &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| Amnesty International &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/07/three-charged-with-supporting-palestine-action-at-london-rally" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;has warned the Met police against&lt;/a&gt; arresting participants protesting this Saturday in London in support of Palestine Action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labour &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;| The UK homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/07/uk-homelessness-minister-rushanara-ali-faces-calls-to-resign-over-tenant-eviction-claims" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; after it emerged she evicted tenants from her east London property before increasing the rent by almost £700 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The latter generally introduce a weakened or inactivated part of a virus to train the immune system to recognise and fight it in the future; whereas mRNA vaccines use a molecule that tells our cells how to make a viral protein, which triggers the body’s immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This technology is a scientific gamechanger, to the extent the researchers behind it won the Nobel prize in 2023. But since rising to prominence during the Covid pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been dogged by misinformation (this analysis by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/06/despite-rfk-funding-block-mrna-vaccines-are-too-impressive-to-ignore" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;my colleague Nicola Davis&lt;/a&gt; is well worth a read.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Michael Head tells me that mRNA technology offers a very effective and adaptable approach to developing vaccines. “It’s often described as plug-and-play because you can adapt constituents of the vaccine with, for example, the latest Covid variant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For something like a flu vaccine, researchers need to incubate the virus and grow it, which takes weeks, Head explains. “That’s fine to an extent when it comes to producing an annual vaccine like we do for seasonal influenza, but the advantage to mRNA technology is that it can be updated so quickly that it allows us to produce new vaccines or update existing vaccines quicker, which can hopefully then reduce the threat of whatever infectious disease is present.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This is crucial during a pandemic such as Covid. “The mRNA vaccines saved about 20 million lives globally in the first year of their rollout,” Head says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Kennedy doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy once described mRNA Covid vaccines as “the deadliest vaccine ever made”. On Wednesday, he justified the health agency’s decision to terminate research by claiming that data shows mRNA vaccines “fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like Covid and flu”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy offered no scientific evidence to support this – and Head said Kennedy has been spreading vaccine misinformation for years. “He has on at least one or two occasions compared vaccines to being like the Holocaust, a common anti-vaccine trope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He has also recently falsely claimed vaccines such as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab contain “&lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aborted foetus debris&lt;/a&gt;”; ordered a sweeping new study on the long-debunked link between vaccines and autism; and dismissed a panel of government vaccine experts, replacing them with his own appointees – who then voted to ban a longstanding vaccine preservative that has been a frequent target of the anti-vaccine movement despite its strong safety record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kennedy claims he is shutting down research on mRNA vaccines and instead shifting funding to “safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate”, and that mRNA vaccines “encourage new mutations and can actually prolong pandemics”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s just not true, though. Head says variants actually tend to emerge in the absence of vaccinations, and in people with long-term infections – often those who are immunocompromised and can’t get over the virus quickly. That gives the virus more chances to multiply and mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Vaccines reduce the risk of transmission and infection,” Head says, which means fewer opportunities for the virus to mutate. “So vaccines will have a protective effect against new variants emerging, rather than as Kennedy suggests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact will this have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The question of the next pandemic is not if, but when. History shows pandemics happen, Head says, pointing to the 1918 flu pandemic, swine flu, Sars, and of course Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Head says this is especially true in our era of globalisation and human encroachment into new environments. “If you create enough opportunities, a new virus will enter human beings. There might be a scenario where it runs out of control like we saw with Covid. Or, it might be a bit more like Sars, where we were able to get it under control within a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“But again, globalisation and the mixing of people and animals makes things more challenging. And so a pandemic will happen at some point. We just don’t know when.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Technologies like mRNA vaccines, then, are vital. Head added that the potential applications go far beyond infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There’s quite promising research on skin cancer and the potential for this technology to be applied across different areas of health,” Head says. That is another reason Kennedy’s decision is so damaging, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of Head’s research areas focuses on how funding decisions impact science such as cancer research. “It’s very early days, but we are starting to see a slightly alarming picture. It’ll be very hard for the rest of the world to fill the cancer research gaps that the US is likely to leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a worrying time for the scientific community?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There is no way to sugarcoat it; this is a particularly alarming moment for scientists. The World Health Organization coined the term “infodemic&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; during the pandemic to describe the overwhelming amount of misinformation that spreads during a public health crisis, Head says. Even before Covid, in 2019 the WHO listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/ten-threats-to-global-health-in-2019" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;top 10 global health threats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I have huge concerns that if a pandemic happened again tomorrow, whether populations in the UK, US, and around the world would trust public health decision making that would be vital to mitigate the impacts of any new pandemic. So the role of misinformation is significant and it can be very severe,” Head warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It does not help that some of the most powerful people, like US president Donald Trump and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;, are making poor quality comments on vaccination because that does have an impact on population level decision making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some of Head’s research has looked into &lt;a href="https://www.panafrican-med-journal.com/content/article/43/165/full/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccine uptake in Ghana&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. The study found that political views played a big role in whether someone agreed to receive a Covid vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“​​The government was saying, go and get vaccinated, please, but there was a fair amount of anti-government sentiment at the time. And hesitancy was greater if you voted for the opposition and therefore trusted the government messaging less.

 Neonatal nurse Lucy Letby became, in tabloid parlance, “Britain’s worst child serial killer” when she was convicted in 2023 of seven murders and seven attempted murders of infants in her care. This brilliantly cogent documentary, which forces sentiment aside and unpacks the science and statistics around the most contested pieces of evidence, covers more ground more meticulously in an hour than any documentary I’ve seen in recent years, and perhaps ever. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Mangan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Film&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; | ★★★★☆&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Lesia, a moody 15-year-old, is sent to her mob boss father’s luxurious and fortified family compound , and she is thrilled when she quickly becomes lieutenant.

 This perception-warping bug puzzler reimagines the inevitably short lifespan of a housefly as an absurd tragedy – by providing the soon-to-perish pest with a bucket list. Over the course of roughly a minute, players buzz around minimalist 2D environments trying to make those last wishes come true. By blending this thinky thesis with playful mechanics, it supplies a lighthearted canvas for players to engage with existentialism for an hour or two. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah Thwaites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="today-in-focus" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Today in Focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="bbd8d0d6-447f-45d3-91c5-a16769da61ec" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A textile worker in Datang subdistrict, Guangzhou, Guangdong province, China.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Go Nakamura/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside China’s fast-fashion factories as a US trade war looms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guardian’s senior China correspondent, Amy Hawkins, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/aug/08/inside-chinas-fast-fashion-factories-as-a-us-trade-war-looms-podcast" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;visits factories threatened by US tariffs&lt;/a&gt; in Guangzhou, south China, as the deadline for a US-China trade agreement approaches with no deal yet in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="cartoon-of-the-day-martin-rowson" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Cartoon of the day | Martin Rowson&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure id="f44eef35-8375-4f61-abb0-2665b124c517" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Martin Rowson/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-upside" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;The Upside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="57c52a6a-bc32-471f-99d8-737a031f94db" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Experts say the return of the lynx would bring many advantages, including hunting overly large populations of deer.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lynx – shy wild cats no bigger than a Labrador – became extinct in Britain 1,300 years ago thanks to hunting and habitat loss.

The paper found that releasing 20 lynx over several years would eventually create a healthy population of about 50 animals, bringing benefits like helping to curb the overpopulation of deer in woodlands. According to the researchers, Kielder Forest is the only area of England and Wales with enough woodland for lynx to thrive.

(Yankner Lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis revealed that the amyloid-beta protein clumps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/3d-molecular-structure-of-alzheimers-brains-revealed-for-the-first-time"&gt;that accompany Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be binding to lithium in the brain, making less of it available to neurons and further accelerating the progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers ran tests on mice, finding that depriving their brains of lithium dramatically increased the clumps of amyloid-beta in their brains. The amount of another Alzheimer's-related protein &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;called tau&lt;/a&gt; also increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better, the researchers found that a certain type of lithium, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_orotate"&gt;lithium orotate&lt;/a&gt;, could evade capture by amyloid-beta proteins. When small doses of it were given to mice with Alzheimer's-like symptoms, the animals' memory function was restored, and other signs of cognitive decline were effectively reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still plenty of questions left unanswered, as is often the case with Alzheimer's, which is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-disease-harms-the-brain-in-2-distinct-phases-study-reveals"&gt;an incredibly complex disease&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, it's not clear how levels of lithium begin to drop, for example, and how that then leads to signs of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies should help to clarify that, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170622" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are the next significant step. Eventually, Alzheimer's could be diagnosed earlier by measuring patients' lithium levels, while lithium supplements could be a useful preventative or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the number of people with dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-can-strike-as-young-as-30-these-are-the-signs-to-watch-for"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, there's an urgent need to find ways of protecting the brain against the devastating consequences of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to be careful about extrapolating from mouse models, and you never know until you try it in a controlled human &lt;span&gt;clinical trial&lt;/span&gt;, but so far the results are very encouraging," &lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/could-lithium-explain-and-treat-alzheimers/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Yankner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09335-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Over the past two centuries, vaccines have been critical for preventing infectious diseases. The  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-does-the-world-health-organisation-do" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73079" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1326154"&gt;vaccination prevents between 3 million and 5 million deaths annually&lt;/a&gt; from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;, measles and, more recently,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there has long been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01526"&gt;broad scientific consensus&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines prevent or mitigate the spread of infections, there is new research suggesting that the therapeutic impact might go beyond the benefit of preventing infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An April 2025 study published in the prominent journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; found tantalizing evidence that the herpes zoster – or shingles – vaccine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08800-x"&gt;could lower the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; in the general population by as much as 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-reveals-2-vaccines-that-appear-to-reduce-dementia-risk"&gt;Huge Study Reveals 2 Vaccines That Appear to Reduce Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a team of physician scientists with expertise in the &lt;a href="https://www.psych.uic.edu/profile/anand-kumar"&gt;clinical&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chicago.medicine.uic.edu/bmg/profiles/rehman-jalees/"&gt;basic science&lt;/a&gt; of neurodegenerative disorders and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We believe that this study potentially opens the door to other breakthroughs in understanding and treating dementia and other degenerative disorders of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A role for vaccines in reducing dementia risk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the major challenges researchers face when trying to study the effects of vaccines is finding an unvaccinated "control group" for comparison – a group that is similar to the vaccine group in all respects, save for the fact that they haven't received the active vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's because it's unethical to assign some patients to the control group and deprive them of vaccine protection against a disease such as shingles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; study took advantage of a policy change in Wales that went into effect in 2013, stating that people born on or after September 2, 1933, were eligible for the herpes zoster vaccination for at least a year, while those born before that cutoff date were not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170677" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/varicella_vaccine_642.jpg" alt="vaccine" class="wp-image-170677 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/varicella_vaccine_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/varicella_vaccine_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/varicella_vaccine_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170677" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Varicella zoster vaccine.

In a statistically sophisticated analysis of health records, the team found that the vaccine reduced the probability of getting dementia by one-fifth over a seven-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that people who received the shingles vaccine were less likely to develop clinical dementia over the seven-year follow-up period, and women benefited more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study design allowed researchers to compare two groups without actively depriving any one group of access to vaccination. The two groups were also of comparable age and had similar medical comorbidities – meaning similar rates of other medical conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from this and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-221231"&gt;other related studies&lt;/a&gt; raise the possibility that vaccines may have a broader role in experimental therapeutics outside the realm of infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies also raise provocative questions about how vaccines work and how our immune system can potentially prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How vaccines might be protective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One scientific explanation for the reduction of dementia by the herpes zoster vaccine could be the direct protection against the shingles virus, which &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-230718"&gt;may play a role in exacerbating dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is also the possibility that the vaccine may have conferred protection by activating the immune system and providing "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6"&gt;trained immunity&lt;/a&gt;," in which the immune system is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20221388"&gt;strengthened by repeated exposure&lt;/a&gt; to vaccines or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not differentiate between different types of dementia, such as dementia due to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease or dementia due to stroke. Additionally, researchers cannot draw any definitive conclusions about possible mechanisms for how the vaccines could be protective from an analysis of health records alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step would be a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study – the "gold standard" for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in medicine – to directly examine how the herpes zoster vaccine compares with a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in their ability to reduce the risk of dementia over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such studies are necessary before any vaccines, as well as other potential therapies, can be recommended for routine clinical use in the prevention of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The challenges of untangling dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a major noncommunicable disease that is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41582-024-01051-w"&gt;a leading cause of death around the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A January 2025 study provided &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03340-9"&gt;updated figures on lifetime dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; across different subsets of the US population. The researchers estimate that the lifetime risk of dementia after age 55 is 42% – more than double earlier estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dementia risk was 4% by age 75, and 20% by age 85, with the majority of risk occurring after 85. The researchers projected that the number of new cases of dementia in the US would double over the next four decades from approximately 514,000 cases in 2020 to 1 million in 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170679" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170679" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642.jpg" alt="elderly man looking at a book with a partner" class="wp-image-170679 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/patient_with_alzheimers_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170679" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cases of dementia could reach 1 million by 2060. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD5TsR1koQ/"&gt;Robert Kneschke/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once considered a disease largely confined to the developed world, the deleterious effects of dementia are now apparent throughout the globe, as life expectancy increases in many formerly developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are different forms of dementia with varying clinical manifestations and underlying neurobiology, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia"&gt;Alzheimer's disease is the most common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prospective studies that specifically test how giving a vaccine changes the risk for future dementia may benefit from studying patient populations with specific types of dementia because each version of dementia might require distinct treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, for the past two to three decades, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1566067"&gt;amyloid hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt; – which posits that accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain contributes to the disorder – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2023.102161"&gt;dominated the scientific conversation&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, most of the efforts in the experimental therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease have focused on drugs that lower the levels of amyloid in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, results to date have been &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(22)02480-1/fulltext"&gt;modest and disappointing&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(23)00274-0/fulltext"&gt;two recently approved amyloid-lowering therapies&lt;/a&gt; have only a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2021.19080873"&gt;minimal impact on slowing the decline&lt;/a&gt;, are expensive and have potentially serious side effects. And no drug currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical use reverses the cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies based on health records suggest that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2022.12.029"&gt;past exposure to viruses increase the risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while routine vaccines, including those against tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="170673" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, shingles and others, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-221231"&gt;reduce the risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Innovation and an open mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is sometimes a tendency among scientists to cling to older, familiar models of disease and a reluctance to move in more unconventional directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the process of doing science has a way of teaching researchers like us humility, opening our minds to new information, learning from our mistakes and going where that data takes us in our quest for effective, life-saving therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines may be one of those paths less traveled. It is an exciting possibility that may open the door to other breakthroughs in understanding and treating degenerative disorders of the brain.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257807/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is a high risk of developing microbial keratitis, otherwise known as a corneal ulcer, that can lead to permanent blindness and in some cases corneal transplant,” she noted. “Instead, always rinse and store in contact lens solution, replace your case regularly, and replace lenses as directed by your eye care provider.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to storing and lubricating your contact lenses improperly, using the same pair for longer than recommended can lead to eye health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never forget to discard my contact lenses in the prescribed time period,” McLaughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They don’t eat an unbalanced diet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eating a diet high in sugar and fat may go without saying as being bad for one’s health, but it also has a disproportionately negative effect on the eyes,” Deobhakta said. “Certain diseases like diabetes are responsible for the most common forms of irreversible blindness that we see in our clinics, and that is often linked to eating an unbalanced diet high in carbohydrates and fat.” &lt;/p&gt;

After a Legionnaires' outbreak that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5652421/#:~:text=During%20the%20summer%20of%202015,tower%20in%20the%20South%20Bronx." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sickened 138 people and killed 16&lt;/a&gt; a decade ago, &lt;a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/ll77of2015.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;city law&lt;/a&gt; requires building owners to test for Legionella bacteria every three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d223h"&gt;In 2017, the first year of inspections, the agency inspected 5,200 cooling towers and issued over 48,000 violations to building owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dt9t6"&gt;This year, the department is on track to complete less than half that number of inspections – just 1,167 as of June, according to data provided by the health department. It’s a record low, not counting 2020 and 2021, when the pandemic disrupted city services. And the number of violations this year is set to hit an all-time low. As of April, the department only issued 269.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="5v2q3"&gt;The data also shows year after year of declining enforcement. After rebounding to 4,400 inspections in 2022, the agency has conducted between 22% and 30% fewer inspections and issued fewer violations each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dhuqh"&gt;Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said the decrease in inspections was due to a lack of inspectors at the agency. She did not respond to questions about the severity of the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a7q6o"&gt;The current outbreak that started in late July has sickened 73 people, three of them fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="50ov4"&gt;The 2017 laws require building owners to register cooling towers and inspect for Legionella bacteria. The law, however, does not indicate how often the city must carry out its own inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6agon"&gt;Cooling tower inspections, according to city experts, are a critical defense against outbreaks of the deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8qu05"&gt;Acting Health Commissioner Michelle Morse told WNYC on Wednesday that the ability to inspect cooling towers after the outbreak helped the city stop the disease's spread in Harlem. However, she did not elaborate on whether more regular inspections could have prevented the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d6ai0"&gt;“From my perspective, there is of course always more that we can do to advance our prevention efforts, and this is why investing in public health is so important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6iafe"&gt;A review of cooling tower registration and inspection data shows that about 1,900 of the 4,928 registered towers in the city have not been inspected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene since 2023 and 85 have no record of inspection by the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cjkk2"&gt;Those towers cool apartments and other large buildings by circulating water through air conditioning systems. The water returns to the cooling tower warm and is evaporated as vapor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="55aas"&gt;Without proper inspection and treatment, that warm water can become a hotbed for deadly Legionella bacteria. Inhaling infected vapor can lead to Legionnaires’ disease, which causes cough, fever, chills, muscle aches and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 22:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNOXZZU2taekFwaEtuQkZCZ2d1SDZJWHFoLXdFNFI4eHA2am9kOHlBbVRtQXZkWFdWbkhIOWVmODd4cTNZNU4xVHJUcE5TWHVoTVYtYUlRRmZ3akxEdjJ5RFJicjFURzVpNFZkMmNnb29tTEhOMUttaXc5RnlpVkFKb1lJcVlyclZqQkdETzRpVmJRaUxZckFnaXRFR1EzUQ</guid></item><item><title>密西西比州的性病率飙升，这是一种流行病！ - TMZ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5HMXRWTUVOcXZNdVp5T0l1WjYwcENqOXR0SkxMU2tSRExwVmd6QkU0dkVoMWFMV1FRQUQ4b1B1NWhRRW55VWZ3ZGlOTElxUTN5VU9OTGFEeDVYUmVWM0xzLVdvRzRDbWRKTXFrUnEydTdSWURPajR30gF3QVVfeXFMTnF5ckJWM1A1RkJGSml2elhLSXJsaFVsWjYxNUsyZ09mV1hpRm1HZDBkU2hLUmJDczVkSEZUNTFSWEFGMjYtazlSWlhZV0F1ZFpRNXZUcVAxUzJLWGVzRzFwX1JlSDBIUVJYYkhoaWlwajlmakpPaFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;header class="article__header"&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Mississippi’s going through a bumpy time lately, and it’s not because of the heat -- turns out, the state is facing a major STD outbreak!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

    &lt;section id="cb-21a2360c78a9dcf3b6c7a27a46e8303a" class="canvas-block canvas-block-permalink canvas-text-block canvas-text-block-permalink canvas-text-block--default  " data-context='{"section":"permalink","name":"text_block"}'&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Southern state, already struggling with sky-high rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and HIV, has just dropped a jaw-dropping stat -- roughly 1,200 cases per 100,000 people. To put that into perspective, that’s at least one person in a room of 100 Mississippians walking around with a sexually transmitted disease or infection. Yikes.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;According to the 2023 report -- with the latest available national CDC figures -- Mississippi’s not just playing in the game, they’re at the top of the leaderboard. The state ranked 3rd for primary and secondary syphilis, 5th for gonorrhea, and a staggering 2nd for chlamydia. Talk about a dirty sweep!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Syphilis, like other STDs, spreads through bacteria when infected fluids make contact -- usually during sex or any of its various acts. It can also be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy, leading to severe health issues if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Health professionals are now sounding the alarm, urging Mississippians to take action -- get tested, stay vigilant, and fight back against syphilis before it claims even more ground. The clock’s ticking, people!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A greasy takeaway may seem like an innocent Friday night indulgence. But our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S3050624725000051"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; suggests even a single high-fat meal could impair blood flow to the brain, potentially increasing the risk of stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dietary fat is an important part of our diet. It provides us with a concentrated source of energy, transports vitamins and when stored in the body, protects our organs and helps keep us warm. The two main types of fat that we consume are saturated and unsaturated (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated), which are differentiated by their chemical composition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But these fats have different effects on our body. For example, it is well established that eating a meal that is high in saturated fat, such as that self-indulgent Friday night takeaway pizza, can be bad for our blood vessels and heart health. And these effects are not simply confined to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The brain has limited energy stores, which means it is heavily reliant on a continuous supply of blood delivering oxygen and glucose to maintain normal function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the body maintains this supply is through a process known as &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X241235878"&gt;“dynamic cerebral autoregulation”&lt;/a&gt;. This process ensures that blood flow to the brain remains stable despite everyday changes in blood pressure, such as standing up and exercising. It’s like having shock absorbers that help keep our brains cool under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when this process is impaired, those swings in blood pressure become harder to manage. That can mean brief episodes of too little or too much blood reaching the brain. Over time, this increases the risk of developing conditions like stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-role-might-diet-play"&gt;What role might diet play?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After eating a meal high in saturated fat, levels of fat in the blood rise and peak after around four hours. At the same time, blood vessels become stiffer and lose their ability to relax and expand. This restricts blood flow around the body. But little is known about what happens to the brain during this time and how well its blood supply is protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this for the first time, we recruited 20 young men between the ages of 18 and 35, and 21 men between 60 and 80. We measured how well blood vessels linked to heart and brain health worked before, and four hours following, consumption of a meal high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We assessed how well a blood vessel in the arm could open up in response to increased blood flow to obtain an indication of heart health. This is a method known as &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00471.2010"&gt;“flow-mediated dilatation”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To evaluate how well blood vessels in the brain could cope with swings in blood pressure, our participants performed body-weight squats. We used ultrasound to determine how well blood flowed through vessels during both methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The test meal was a milkshake, which we called “the brain bomb” because it consisted mostly of heavy whipping cream. The drink contained 1,362 calories and 130g of fat, mimicking the fat load of a fast-food takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirmed previous research that has shown that a high-fat meal impairs the ability of the blood vessels linked to heart health to open in both young and old participants. These impairments reduced the brain’s ability to buffer changes in blood pressure. This was more pronounced (by about 10%) in the older adults, suggesting that older brains may be more vulnerable to the effects of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we didn’t directly test for the long-term effects of a high-fat meal on mental functioning in this study, &lt;a href="https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/131/23/2807/71652/Post-prandial-hyperlipidaemia-results-in-systemic?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;we have previously shown&lt;/a&gt; that such a meal increases free radicals (unstable, cell-damaging molecules) and decreases nitric oxide (molecules that help blood vessels relax and open up to transport oxygen and glucose around the body).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may explain the reduced blood flow regulation we observed in our recent study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has important clinical implications. While an occasional takeaway is unlikely to cause harm on its own, our results suggest that even one fatty meal has an immediate effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our study highlights the importance of consuming a diet that is low in saturated fat to protect not only our heart health, but also our brain health. This is particularly important for older adults whose brains appear to be more vulnerable to the effects of such a meal and are already at increased risk of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;NHS recommendeds&lt;/a&gt; that men consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, while women should consume no more than 20g. Yet many of us routinely exceed that, particularly during weekend takeaways, pub lunches or fast-food splurges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s more, we may spend much of our waking lives in a post-meal state. This period, known as &lt;a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0568-5"&gt;“post-prandial lipaemia”&lt;/a&gt;, is when fat levels are elevated, and when the body, it seems, may be most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-food-for-thought"&gt;Food for thought&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There’s still so much more we need to learn about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends swapping saturated fats for polyunsaturated ones. These are found in foods like oily fish, walnuts and seeds, which are associated with better heart and brain health over the long term. But we don’t yet know how the brain responds to a single meal that is high in polyunsaturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nor do we know how the female brain responds to a high-fat meal. This is a crucial gap in our knowledge since women face a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00249-8/fulltext"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; in later life compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our study offers a timely reminder that diet doesn’t just shape our long-term health. It also affects our body and brain in real time. And as we’re learning, when it comes to protecting brain health, every meal may count.&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A 1-month-old infant on Martha’s Vineyard contracted a rare but serious tick-borne disease, her family and local health officials said, as &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/09/northeast-sees-worst-summer-surge-in-tick-bites-in-years-cdc-says/"&gt;tick-borne diseases&lt;/a&gt; are on the rise across the state this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powassan virus was detected in a resident of &lt;a href="http://Boston.com/tag/marthas-vineyard"&gt;Martha’s Vineyard&lt;/a&gt;, local public health officials said Monday. The virus is transmitted by deer ticks within 15 minutes of a bite, and there is no specific treatment, vaccine, or cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local public health announcement comes during one of the &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/07/09/northeast-sees-worst-summer-surge-in-tick-bites-in-years-cdc-says/"&gt;largest surges&lt;/a&gt; in tick bites in the last five years. In Massachusetts, most of the tick exposure was concentrated in the Berkshires and on Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/lists/monthly-tick-borne-disease-reports#2025-"&gt;the state’s May 2025 report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While rare, the rate of Powassan virus is increasing, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/about/index.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, and can cause severe disease, including inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, as well as brain swelling, confusion, loss of coordination, difficulty speaking, and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 1 and 2 percent of nymph deer tickets on Martha’s Vineyard are infected, said Sam Telford, a Tufts University professor who researches on the island. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The virus is present every year in a small percentage of deer ticks; fortunately, severe disease remains very rare,” Telford said in a &lt;a href="https://www.capecod.gov/2025/08/05/press-release-rare-but-serious-tick-borne-virus-investigated-on-marthas-vineyard/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a similar rate to that seen elsewhere in New England. This suggests that many people who are exposed may successfully fight off the virus without ever knowing they were infected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-month-old Lily, born on June 30, was on a walk with her mom and her older sister on a West Tisbury bike path near her home, her family told the &lt;a href="https://vineyardgazette.com/news/2025/08/05/west-tisbury-infant-contracts-powassan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vineyard Gazette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The infant was first taken to the hospital with a high fever, and doctors eventually determined the source was the tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suffered brain damage, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-lily-siscos-health-journey?lang=en_US&amp;amp;utm_campaign=man_ss_icons&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=copy_link&amp;amp;attribution_id=sl%3Aed5b139f-5cd0-4ba3-8249-d52adf974399&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawL_K8pleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFXWGJTOXp2M2FTZGdIYnBXAR7a61BX1DlBiy46pvum9XsqoVWf_JDlIUd_J-q-xDYIQgrR3u5M1VozBphn_g_aem_zxBXvhKa8vqN8tK30hctcQ"&gt;GoFundMe created for the family&lt;/a&gt;, due to meningitis and encephalitis from the Powassan, which was unknown at the time, an update last week said. The baby was receiving care at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Please, please check yourselves, your children and your pets,” Tiffany Sisco said, according to the &lt;em&gt;Gazette&lt;/em&gt;. “It was the tiniest nymph tick the size of a needle tip. No rash or bullseye was detected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisco was sharing updates on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tiffany.lynn.9003/posts/pfbid02DVzwZi1GMzS2pVsTprpTozSGWeZzCzgNTsbMfg6bCALdKFmYw46SM1VSmCmujZyTl"&gt;her Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, where she said Thursday morning that Lily was stable “and awaiting further tests” in her final public update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(We) hope to bring her home soon,” Sisco wrote. “Continued prayers as we navigate our new normal.”&lt;/p&gt;

Instances of the disease are pretty rare overall, with pancreatic cancer only accounting for 3% of all cancers in the United States, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society" data-node-id="0.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, it's more common in men than women. However, a 2023 study published in the journal &lt;em data-node-id="0.3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gastroenterology" data-node-id="0.3.0" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women" data-node-id="0.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women&lt;/a&gt;, especially in women of color, than they are in men. &lt;em data-node-id="0.7"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This fact, plus the aggressive nature of the illness, are why knowing the symptoms of pancreatic cancer is so important. “It has a high likelihood of spread, or metastasis, to other organs in the body,” said &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Woody, M.D." data-node-id="1.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic. What's more, the five-year survival rate is only 9%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society" data-node-id="1.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Why is the disease on the rise? Part of it is due to increased detection, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Valerie Lee, M.D." data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital. Lifestyle factors may be playing a role as well. Increases in diabetes and obesity—two major risk factors for pancreatic cancer—may also be contributing to the rise in pancreatic cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="body-tip css-1707dxl emevuu60"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Neil Woody, M.D." data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic; &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Valerie Lee, M.D." data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital; &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Reiss, M.D." data-node-id="4.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-pancreatic-cancer-is-tough-to-diagnose" data-node-id="5" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emevuu60"&gt;Why pancreatic cancer is tough to diagnose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Only about 10% of pancreatic cancers have a genetic predisposition, and good screenings for the general population have been difficult to establish, said Dr. Woody. “Tests with high likelihood of detecting pancreatic cancer, such as endoscopic ultrasound, are invasive, costly, and may carry risks of complications that outweigh their use as screening tests for the average person,” he explained.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;What’s more, many of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer can be caused by other conditions. Plus, people have almost no symptoms at all until the cancer has spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, if you are experiencing any of these warning signs, it’s worth making an appointment with your doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="9" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;1. You have no major risk factors for diabetes but suddenly have it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The pancreas produces insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. So if blood sugar levels suddenly chance, the pancreas becomes the number one suspect. “When people with no risk factors for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="diabetes" data-node-id="10.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (no family history, good diet, thin body type) develop new onset diabetes, or who have a history of well controlled diabetes suddenly find that it becomes difficult to control, it’s reasonable to evaluate why the pancreas may not be functioning as well,” said Dr. Lee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;2. You experience abdominal pain that feels like you're being squeezed around the middle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The pancreas sits close to a bundle of blood vessels and nerves called the celiac plexus that can cause pain and nerve irritation,” said Dr. Lee. When it happens, the pain is usually pretty encompassing of your abdomen.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Patients feel pain from the epigastrum (the area just under the sternum) through to their back. Imagine a tire hiked up right under your chest and around your abdomen,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kim Reiss, M.D." data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="14" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;3. You develop an unexplained blood clot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Patients with pancreas cancer are particularly prone to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="blood clots" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lee.

If a tumor prevents the bile ducts from draining bile appropriately, people may develop elevated levels of bilirubin in their body, which translates into jaundice, or a yellowing of the skin. “This is usually best seen in the white of the eyes, and can also lead to itching all over the body, light colored stools, and darkened urine,” said Dr. Lee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-1cdwwr0 emevuu60"&gt;6.

Instances of the disease are pretty rare overall, with pancreatic cancer only accounting for 3% of all cancers in the United States, per the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, it's more common in men than women. However, a 2023 study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/study-confirms-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-faster-in-women-than-men/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gastroenterology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Gastroenterology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42860161/study-pancreatic-cancer-rates-rising-in-young-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rates of pancreatic cancer are rising faster in women&lt;/a&gt;, especially in women of color, than they are in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This fact, plus the aggressive nature of the illness, are why knowing the symptoms of pancreatic cancer is so important. “It has a high likelihood of spread, or metastasis, to other organs in the body,” said &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neil Woody, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic. What's more, the five-year survival rate is only 9%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why is the disease on the rise? Part of it is due to increased detection, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valerie Lee, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital. Lifestyle factors may be playing a role as well. Increases in diabetes and obesity—two major risk factors for pancreatic cancer—may also be contributing to the rise in pancreatic cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/neil-woody/4271517" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neil Woody, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Neil Woody, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the Cleveland Clinic; &lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/valerie-lee/2701497" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valerie Lee, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Valerie Lee, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital; &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kim Reiss, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Why pancreatic cancer is tough to diagnose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is notoriously difficult to diagnose. Only about 10% of pancreatic cancers have a genetic predisposition, and good screenings for the general population have been difficult to establish, said Dr. Woody. “Tests with high likelihood of detecting pancreatic cancer, such as endoscopic ultrasound, are invasive, costly, and may carry risks of complications that outweigh their use as screening tests for the average person,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What’s more, many of the symptoms of pancreatic cancer can be caused by other conditions. Plus, people have almost no symptoms at all until the cancer has spread to other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, if you are experiencing any of these warning signs, it’s worth making an appointment with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;1. You have no major risk factors for diabetes but suddenly have it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The pancreas produces insulin, the hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. So if blood sugar levels suddenly chance, the pancreas becomes the number one suspect. “When people with no risk factors for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a21764231/type-2-diabetes-definition/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; (no family history, good diet, thin body type) develop new onset diabetes, or who have a history of well controlled diabetes suddenly find that it becomes difficult to control, it’s reasonable to evaluate why the pancreas may not be functioning as well,” said Dr. Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. You experience abdominal pain that feels like you're being squeezed around the middle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The pancreas sits close to a bundle of blood vessels and nerves called the celiac plexus that can cause pain and nerve irritation,” said Dr. Lee. When it happens, the pain is usually pretty encompassing of your abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Patients feel pain from the epigastrum (the area just under the sternum) through to their back. Imagine a tire hiked up right under your chest and around your abdomen,” said &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/kim-reiss-binder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kim Reiss, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Kim Reiss, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an oncologist specializing in pancreatic cancer at the University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;3. You develop an unexplained blood clot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Patients with pancreas cancer are particularly prone to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/g20489603/6-signs-you-might-have-a-blood-clot/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood clots;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;blood clots&lt;/a&gt;,” said Dr. Lee. While the exact cause is not known, it is believed that cancer cells reduce production of the proteins the body uses to prevent blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“For people who do not have a reason for the development of a clot—a recent major surgery, trauma (like a car accident), hospitalization, or prolonged period where you are laying still, or a hereditary predisposition to clotting—we recommend making sure you are up to date on your cancer screening and to check in with your doctor about any other symptoms that may help to identify the source of the clotting abnormality,” said Dr. Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;4.

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're a true pasta lover, then you probably understand the struggle. Whether a classic Italian spaghetti Bolognese coated in a delicious, slow-cooked meaty ragù and finished with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese, a &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1757604/aglio-e-olio-simple-sauce/" target="_blank"&gt;three-ingredient aglio e olio for those nights you just don't want to cook at all&lt;/a&gt;, or a simple yet mouthwatering penne marinara, simmered in fresh tomatoes and topped with several basil leaves — the choices are endless. Unfortunately though, so are the carbs as well as the gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to gluten, there are plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1693410/gluten-free-pasta-brands-ranked-best-worst/" target="_blank"&gt;gluten-free pasta brands&lt;/a&gt; to choose from. However, that doesn't change the fact that a single serving of your favorite spaghetti carbonara packs over 900 calories. Still, there are very few reasons to completely cut pasta out of your diet, unless you develop an allergy or a medical condition like Celiac disease. For those who can digest gluten, experts suggest that eating it two to three times a week is more than enough. If you're feeling guilty for going over that limit this week, here's something that will surely brighten your day: According to science, pasta actually makes you happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was Italian scientists who conducted this research (of course). As a matter of fact, in 2023, the team at the &lt;a href="https://internationalpasta.org/news/pasta-makes-you-happy/" target="_blank"&gt;Behavioral and Brain Lab at Milan's Free University of Languages and Communication (IULM)&lt;/a&gt; used techniques to measure people's brain activity and closely watched participants' behavior. These techniques are close to those one would use for a lie detector test. They actually evaluated the facial reactions, brain activity, heart rate shifts, and micro perspiration of 40 people aged between 25 and 55. Oh, and needless to say, this was all happening as they were consuming pasta. So, what did the results show?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists at IULM were surprised to discover that eating just a single plate of pasta triggered the same kind of positive emotional-cognitive response in the participants as listening to a song played by their favorite band, watching the Olympics, or watching their favorite tennis player land a match-winning shot at Wimbledon. While the team linked this emotional boost to the way pasta, a beloved comfort food, activates memories and feelings of comfort and pleasure, it's now the only study to reveal a link between pasta and happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating a bowl of your favorite pasta dish (and therefore carbs) anywhere — at home or any of the &lt;a href="https://www.chowhound.com/1693690/best-italian-restaurants-nyc/" target="_blank"&gt;20 best Italian restaurants in New York City&lt;/a&gt; — releases endorphins, hormones that increase feelings of joy, while reducing stress and anxiety. What's more, pasta is considered a complex carbohydrate. Unlike simple carbs, complex ones are made up of longer chains of sugar molecules, which provide a steadier stream of energy and boost serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because complex carbohydrates support the production of tryptophan, an amino acid and precursor to the so-called feel-good hormone, which plays a great role in mood regulation. And finally, pasta keeps up to 80% of its B-vitamins even after cooking, which, in turn, are essential for converting tryptophan into serotonin. So next time you're feeling a bit down, don't be too hard on yourself, just get that pasta boiling. Then whip up your favorite sauce, mix it all together, and dig right in.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

	Erica Kahn was on vacation in Arizona with her father last year when a wild bat flew into her open mouth.&lt;em&gt; GoFundMe&lt;/em&gt;	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

					
				&lt;/header&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A Massachusetts woman was left on the hook for thousands of dollars in medical bills after a &lt;a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/01/06/new-hampshire-elementary-school-closed-after-hundreds-of-hibernating-bats-found-in-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; flew into her open mouth during a stargazing trip to Arizona last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Kahn and her father were snapping long-exposure photos of the nighttime landscape at Horseshoe Bend when a wild bat managed to wedge itself between Kahn’s camera and her face. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I was screaming, part of the bat unfortunately went in my mouth (fun fact, they taste earthy and a little sweet!),” Kahn recalled on a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-erica-kahn-with-medical-bills-after-rabies-exposure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; to help cover her subsequent medical bills. She said her father, a doctor, recommended she go to an emergency room to receive &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-exposure prophylaxis&lt;/a&gt; for rabies due to the close contact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was a catch: The 33-year-old biomedical engineer was temporarily uninsured, having opted to forgo health insurance after she was laid off last summer. Kahn found an insurance policy online the day after the bat incident and signed up, figuring she’d be covered when she went to the hospital, according to &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/tourist-rabies-treatment-wild-bat-in-mouth-surprise-bill-of-the-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Kahn’s chosen insurer had a 30-day waiting period for benefits to kick in, the news outlet reported. Four hospital visits and seven shots later, Kahn’s medical bills totaled $20,749.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it must have been a mistake,” she told KFF. “I guess I was naive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., bats are the most-reported animals with rabies, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/bats.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the CDC reports that most people who die of rabies in the U.S. have been exposed to a rabid bat. The agency also notes that bat bites can be tiny, and anyone who gets bat saliva or brain matter in their eyes, nose, mouth, or open wounds should seek urgent medical care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/04/09/1091797594/the-capitol-fox-fascinated-folks-but-no-one-mentioned-the-cost-of-rabies-treatme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt; reports, post-exposure treatment — which usually involves several doses of the rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin — can cost thousands of dollars even before hospital fees kick in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now employed again and working to negotiate and pay down her medical bills, Kahn is turning to GoFundMe for help covering some of the costs. With a fundraising goal of $12,000, she’s also vowed to donate half of the proceeds to UNICEF to support health care for families in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she acknowledged her mistake in declining to stay on her former employer’s insurance under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), Kahn said the cost of her medical care was “pretty extreme.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish our health care system wasn’t so broken in the United States,” she added on her fundraising page. “I believe life-saving medical care is a fundamental human right and it’s depressing that Americans can only turn to GoFundMe instead of a federally protected safety net.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Kahn was adamant she harbors no ill will toward bats. She’s also tried to keep a sense of humor about the ordeal, medical bills notwithstanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As Michael Scott &lt;a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/156289049543354268/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;said in The Office&lt;/a&gt;, ‘myth: three Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: *four* Americans every year die from rabies,’” Kahn joked on her GoFundMe.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Washington state officials have revealed that a &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/"&gt;local woman has been diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with malaria, which, if confirmed, would mark the first known case of the disease being acquired in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The woman was diagnosed with malaria, a mosquito-borne illness caused by a parasite, on August 2, according to the officials. State and federal public health agencies are working to confirm the source of the infection, according to a statement published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials believe that the infection may have been transmitted by a mosquito that bit someone else who already had a travel-associated case of malaria. The woman is currently receiving treatment and is being closely monitored. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills, body aches, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can take up to 30 days for an infected person to start showing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cases of malaria in the U.S. are typically linked to travel—mainly to visitors with ties to sub-Saharan African countries—and the disease is not considered endemic to the U.S. In fact, the U.S. effectively &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/history/index.html"&gt;eradicated malaria in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt; thanks to aggressive control measures, including pesticides and improved drainage. But the Anopheles mosquito which transmits malaria lives all over the country: If they bite someone infected with the disease, the bugs could feasibly transmit the parasite that causes malaria to other people in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Between 20-70 cases of malaria are recorded in Washington each year and there are typically around 2,000 cases annually across the U.S., according to official estimates. While many are linked to travel, there has been a recent uptick in locally-acquired infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2023, the U.S. experienced its first locally acquired malaria case in 20 years. And between May and October of that year, 10 such cases were reported across Florida, Texas, Maryland, and Arkansas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Climate change may be driving the incidence of local malaria infections up: The parasite that causes malaria needs warm temperatures to thrive, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11398779/"&gt;research suggests&lt;/a&gt; more cases of the disease could arise in previously malaria-free areas as the planet warms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has historically been the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/issue-brief/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-freeze-and-global-health-the-biggest-gaps-left-on-the-donor-landscape/"&gt;top donor nation&lt;/a&gt; to global efforts to combat malaria, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-the-presidents-malaria-initiative-pmi/"&gt;according to health nonprofit KFF&lt;/a&gt;. But those initiatives took a hit when the Trump administration slashed the country’s foreign aid programs earlier this year, including most of the work of the President’s Malaria Initiative—a USAID program launched in 2005 focused on reducing malaria in countries where the disease is endemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of the investigation in Washington, officials are working with the U.S. Department of Health to trap and test mosquitoes. Local authorities have stressed that people in the area of the state where the woman was infected remain at very low risk of contracting malaria.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The risk of getting infected with malaria in Pierce County remains very low,” James Miller, health officer for Tacoma-Pierce County, said in a &lt;a href="https://tpchd.org/news/we-are-investigating-possible-locally-acquired-case-of-malaria/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Malaria is a rare disease overall in the United States—and the vast majority of cases in the United States occur following exposures in countries with ongoing transmission.”&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bromide sedatives vanished from the US market by 1989, after the Food and Drug Administration banned them, and "bromism" as a syndrome is today unfamiliar to many Americans. (Though you can still get it by &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/15563659709001219"&gt;drinking, as one poor guy did, two to four liters of cola daily [!],&lt;/a&gt; if that cola contains "brominated vegetable oil." Fortunately, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-revokes-regulation-allowing-use-brominated-vegetable-oil-bvo-food"&gt;removed brominated vegetable oil&lt;/a&gt; from US food products in 2024.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, over the man's first day at the hospital, he grew worse and showed "increasing paranoia and auditory and visual hallucinations." He then attempted to escape the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the escape attempt, the man was given an involuntary psychiatric hold and an anti-psychosis drug. He was administered large amounts of fluids and electrolytes, as the best way to beat bromism is "aggressive saline diuresis"—that is, to load someone up with liquids and let them pee out all the bromide in their system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This took time, as the man's bromide level was eventually measured at a whopping 1,700 mg/L, while the "reference range" for healthy people is 0.9 to 7.3 mg/L.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the man suffered from a terrifying psychosis and was kept in the hospital for &lt;em&gt;three full weeks&lt;/em&gt; over an entirely preventable condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How it all began&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during his stay, once doctors had his psychosis under control, that the man began telling them how it all began. He had read about the problems with too much table salt, which led him to rid his diet of sodium chloride, which led him to ChatGPT, which led him to believe that he could use sodium bromide instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors who &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260"&gt;wrote up this case study for Annals of Internal Medicine: Clinical Cases&lt;/a&gt; note that they never got access to the man's actual ChatGPT logs. He likely used ChatGPT 3.5 or 4.0, they say, but it's not clear that the man was actually told by the chatbot to do what he did. Bromide salts &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be substituted for table salt—just not in the human body. They are used in various cleaning products and pool treatments, however.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A greasy takeaway may seem like an innocent Friday night indulgence. But our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S3050624725000051"&gt;recent research&lt;/a&gt; suggests even a single high-fat meal could impair blood flow to the brain, potentially increasing the risk of stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fat is an important part of our diet. It provides us with a concentrated source of energy, transports  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="170438" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and when stored in the body, protects our organs and helps keep us warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two main types of fat that we consume are saturated and unsaturated (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated), which are differentiated by their chemical composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-a-high-fat-diet-may-increase-your-anxiety-study-warns"&gt;Eating a High-Fat Diet May Increase Your Anxiety, Study Warns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these fats have different effects on our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, it is well established that eating a meal that is high in saturated fat, such as that self-indulgent Friday night takeaway pizza, can be bad for our blood vessels and heart health. And these effects are not simply confined to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain has limited energy stores, which means it is heavily reliant on a continuous supply of blood delivering oxygen and glucose to maintain normal function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the ways the body maintains this supply is through a process known as &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X241235878"&gt;"dynamic cerebral autoregulation"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process ensures that blood flow to the brain remains stable despite everyday changes in blood pressure, such as standing up and exercising. It's like having shock absorbers that help keep our brains cool under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when this process is impaired, those swings in blood pressure become harder to manage. That can mean brief episodes of too little or too much blood reaching the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, this increases the risk of developing conditions like stroke and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What role might diet play?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating a meal high in saturated fat, levels of fat in the blood rise and peak after around four hours. At the same time, blood vessels become stiffer and lose their ability to relax and expand. This restricts blood flow around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But little is known about what happens to the brain during this time and how well its blood supply is protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this for the first time, we recruited 20 young men between the ages of 18 and 35, and 21 men between 60 and 80. We measured how well blood vessels linked to heart and brain health worked before, and four hours following, consumption of a meal high in saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assessed how well a blood vessel in the arm could open up in response to increased blood flow to obtain an indication of heart health. This is a method known as &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpheart.00471.2010"&gt;"flow-mediated dilatation"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate how well blood vessels in the brain could cope with swings in blood pressure, our participants performed body-weight squats. We used ultrasound to determine how well blood flowed through vessels during both methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test meal was a milkshake, which we called "the brain bomb" because it consisted mostly of heavy whipping cream. The drink contained 1,362 calories and 130g of fat, mimicking the fat load of a fast-food takeaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirmed previous research that has shown that a high-fat meal impairs the ability of the blood vessels linked to heart health to open in both young and old participants. These impairments reduced the brain's ability to buffer changes in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was more pronounced (by about 10%) in the older adults, suggesting that older brains may be more vulnerable to the effects of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we didn't directly test for the long-term effects of a high-fat meal on mental functioning in this study, &lt;a href="https://portlandpress.com/clinsci/article-abstract/131/23/2807/71652/Post-prandial-hyperlipidaemia-results-in-systemic?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;we have previously shown&lt;/a&gt; that such a meal increases free radicals (unstable, cell-damaging molecules) and decreases nitric oxide (molecules that help blood vessels relax and open up to transport oxygen and glucose around the body).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain the reduced blood flow regulation we observed in our recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170513" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170513" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515.png" alt="Diagram showing how fat can stiffen arteries" class="wp-image-170513 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515.png 1920w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-642x416.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-640x415.png 640w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-768x498.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-1536x996.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/StiffenigOfBloodVesselsFatImpacts-e1754543603515-600x389.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170513" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stiff arteries and a sluggish brain. (Chris Marley/Damian Bailey)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has important clinical implications. While an occasional takeaway is unlikely to cause harm on its own, our results suggest that even one fatty meal has an immediate effect on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study highlights the importance of consuming a diet that is low in saturated fat to protect not only our heart health, but also our brain health. This is particularly important for older adults whose brains appear to be more vulnerable to the effects of such a meal and are already at increased risk of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;NHS recommendeds&lt;/a&gt; that men consume no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, while women should consume no more than 20g. Yet many of us routinely exceed that, particularly during weekend takeaways, pub lunches or fast-food splurges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, we may spend much of our waking lives in a post-meal state. This period, known as &lt;a href="https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-017-0568-5"&gt;"post-prandial lipaemia"&lt;/a&gt;, is when fat levels are elevated, and when the body, it seems, may be most at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Food for thought&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still so much more we need to learn about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends swapping saturated fats for polyunsaturated ones. These are found in foods like oily fish, walnuts and seeds, which are associated with better heart and brain health over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we don't yet know how the brain responds to a single meal that is high in polyunsaturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor do we know how the female brain responds to a high-fat meal. This is a crucial gap in our knowledge since women face a greater risk of &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000950"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00249-8/fulltext"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; in later life compared to men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study offers a timely reminder that diet doesn't just shape our long-term health. It also affects our body and brain in real time. And as we're learning, when it comes to protecting brain health, every meal may count.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259961/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Yet there are a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/health/superager-secrets-good-memory-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lucky few, called “SuperAgers,”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lucky few, called “SuperAgers,”&lt;/a&gt; who possess a brain that fights back. For these people, memories stay as sharp as they were 30 or more years in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Carol Siegler, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Palatine, is a SuperAger. At 82, she won the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament for her age group, which she said she entered “as a gag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’ve auditioned twice for ‘Jeopardy!’ and did well enough on it to be invited to the live auditions. Then Covid hit,” Siegler told me in 2022, when she was 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Today, Siegler is still going strong, well on her way to her 90th birthday, said Tamar Gefen, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Mesulam Institute for Cognitive Neurology and Alzheimer’s Disease at Northwestern University in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superager Carol Seigler is shown four years ago, at 85, when this picture was taken. - Jennifer Boyle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Gefen conducts research at &lt;a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/join/SuperAging.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Northwestern’s SuperAging Program;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Northwestern’s SuperAging Program&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently studying 113 SuperAgers. Over the past 25 years, however, 80 SuperAgers have donated their brain tissue to the program, which has led to some fascinating discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;CNN spoke to Gefen about those decades of work. She is a coauthor of a new analysis of the research that was published Thursday in &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70312" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: How do you define a SuperAger, and what have you found out about their behavior over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tamar Gefen:&lt;/strong&gt; To be a SuperAger in our program at Northwestern, a person must be over 80 and undergo extensive cognitive testing. Acceptance in the study only occurs if the person’s episodic memory — the ability to recall everyday events and past personal history — is as good or better than cognitively normal people in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We have screened close to 2,000 individuals who think they may be a SuperAger and less than 10% meet the criteria. Over the past 25 years, we have studied about 300 SuperAgers — a number of whom have donated their brain for research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One key trait of SuperAgers is that they seem to be highly social people. They value connection and are often active in their communities. This is interesting because we know isolation is a risk factor for developing dementia, and so staying socially active is a known protective feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another common thread in all SuperAgers is a sense of autonomy, freedom and independence. They’re making decisions and living their lives the way that they want to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I feel very strongly that successful aging is not just about sociability. If a person feels trapped, tethered or burdened, especially in a vulnerable state like poor health or older age, I think it can encroach on their entire psychosocial being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But as far as healthy behaviors, SuperAgers run the gamut. We have SuperAgers with heart disease, diabetes, who aren’t physically active, who don’t eat any better than their similar age peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is one SuperAger who drinks four beers every night. He laughs and says, “Maybe it’s done me wrong, but I’ll never know.” He doesn’t have an identical twin to compare his behavior to, so would he have lived to 108 instead of 98? We don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Many of your most intriguing discoveries have come from studying donor brain tissue. What have you discovered about the memory center of the SuperAger brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gefen: &lt;/strong&gt; Our &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25632151/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies have shown;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that an area of the brain that is responsible for attention, motivation, and cognitive engagement — known as the cingulate cortex — is thicker in SuperAgers, even compared with those of people in their 50s and 60s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain, we found SuperAgers have three times fewer tau tangles when compared to their “normal” peers. Abnormal formations of tau proteins are one of the key signs of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In Alzheimer’s disease, tau also targets the neurons of the primary neurons of the cholinergic system — which is responsible for sustaining our attention in daily life. But that doesn’t happen in the brain of a SuperAger. Therefore, the cholinergic system appears to be stronger, and likely more plastic and flexible for reasons that we’re not sure about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s interesting, because I see SuperAgers as focused. They can pay close attention, engage and actively listen. How else could they recall 13 out of 15 random words after 30 minutes? I picture them engraving the words on their cortex with a chisel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;SuperAger brains also have bigger, healthier cells in the entorhinal cortex, an area essential for memory and learning, that has direct connections to the hippocampus. The entorhinal cortex, by the way, is one of the first areas of the brain to get hit by Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tamar Gefen holds a younger brain that is used for comparison with brain tissue of SuperAgers. - Allegra Kawles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36180225/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:another study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; we examined every layer of cells within the entorhinal cortex of SuperAgers, and we painstakingly measured the size of the neurons. We found that in layer two, which is the layer that is most important for information transmission, SuperAgers had humongous, plump, intact, beautiful, gigantic entorhinal cortex neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It was an incredible finding, because their entorhinal neurons were even larger than those in individuals who are much younger, some even in their 30s. That told us there is a structural integrity component at play — like the architecture, the bones, the skeleton of the neuron itself is sturdier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We’re expanding the studies of these neurons to understand their biochemical signatures, determine what makes them special, and see if these signatures are found in other types of neurons in the brain of SuperAgers. Are these same neurons particularly vulnerable in those with Alzheimer’s disease, and if so, how and why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What have you learned from your research about how the brain of a SuperAger reacts to injury, disease and stress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gefen:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re looking at the inflammatory system in the brain of SuperAgers, with the goal of understanding how the immune cells in their brain respond to disease and adapt to stress. Inflammation, once it crosses a certain threshold, is a major component of cell loss in Alzheimer’s disease and nearly all other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Compared with the brain of same-age peers, SuperAgers have fewer activated microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, in their white matter. White matter is the brain’s super highway, transporting information from one part of the brain to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here’s how it works: Microglia are activated because there is some kind of antigen or disease, typically something destructive in the brain. In some cases, however, microglia and other immune cells become hyperactive and go into overdrive, thus causing inflammation and possible damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The brain of a SuperAger, however, has fewer activated microglia. In fact, the levels of microglia were on par with people in their 30s, 40s and 50s. That could mean there is less junk or disease in the brain of a SuperAger so the microglia have no need to be active. Or it could mean microglia are responding efficiently to in clearing out disease or toxins, and because they are more plastic and adaptable, the microglia are able to activate, respond and then calm down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All of this is fascinating — it may be that at the cellular level, the immune system of a SuperAger brain could be stronger or more adaptive, much like the layers of cells we found in the entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Whether or not you were born with the right genes to protect your brain sounds like the luck of the draw. What does that mean for the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gefen: &lt;/strong&gt;Genetics are tricky. It’s not just whether you have a gene or not, it about how your internal and external environment works together to influence how a gene is “turned on,” or expressed — some may be more highly expressed, some will have lower expression. This is the epigenetic part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is a list of candidate genes that we are starting to study very carefully, these are genes that also have a role in aspects of longevity, senescence, cell repair and cognitive reserve to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I’m excited about that, not only for the genetics that are heritable from parents, but also genetics at the cell level, that enable each neuron or immune cell to carry out its respective job within the brain. With the technology that’s advancing so rapidly, I’m certain we’re going to get to a point where prevention or modification at the genetic level will be part of the playbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Clearly, there is not a one target resolution for Alzheimer’s disease. I know we all want that one easy fix but it’s just simply not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s going to take many teams and many specialists to come together and create a kind of personalized cocktail for prevention or treatment. I think it’s possible, but it’s going to take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>yahoo.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 18:25:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOSWh2Rk92M1Y2a0NqaHY5ZmVwdnhweTUzR1otV2Mtb3ZyalBuNmNNSS1qMWxrb1VWanN1bmxaNjFlSnFsMHpxRlVxTGFRLTRwM2t3Q3R4bXV2QlF3amhIRnJXRE9vMlRvakxGWndxTkRhNUd2MlJnM1FieF90ZWpTa3ZGM0lTYngyTFE</guid></item><item><title>这种已经批准的药物可以阻止食物过敏的最严重反应- Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQbk13bGFhSmRJM0E0RmcwcGdGVG1xZUlJZ1p5MFlDd3UzQTljT1JyZk9sWjUwLVlWblZWOEpGenlvb2g3eFRkd0tDOEM2SDlNRmI4YlFON3dwUVRMVXVuUV93QWtTcGw4WXBXRGlFVGZzSlJCM1JsVUVNTjhMalZXLTQ5YlhjUlJIZlJOLXNRdl9LVkdQQ1pxVzZwUmhBNnlK?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Food allergies suck. Beyond placing onerous limits on your diet, their health impacts can totally derail your life, and scientists have been scrambling for years to try and find better, more lasting treatments for these conditions’ worst effects. Now, a pair of papers published today in the journal Science unlock crucial new insights into what goes on in the body when anaphylaxis occurs and indicate how an existing medication could one day help prevent these life-threatening allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://ww.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp0246"&gt;one paper&lt;/a&gt;, a team of scientists reveal evidence in lab mice for a previously unknown pathway in the gut that may be responsible for some food allergy symptoms. And in the &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp0240"&gt;second paper&lt;/a&gt;, another team demonstrates that an asthma drug called zileuton blocks a crucial aspect of this pathway in mice, seemingly preventing the expected allergic reactions from happening in most cases. The researchers are now launching a clinical trial to test whether zileuton can pull off the same trick in people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If so, this could provide a treatment to prevent anaphylaxis,” Adam James Williams and Stephanie Eisenbarth, both immunologists at &lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2021/09/02/prominent-immunologist-named-chief-of-allergy-and-immunology/"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt; who are co-authors on the second paper, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Scientists have been working for years to solve a perplexing mystery: Why do some people who have tested positive for food allergies not become sick when exposed to the trigger food, while others with the same allergy develop anaphylaxis?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers describe a gene called DPEP1 that seems to play a surprising role in controlling food-related anaphylaxis in mice: The gene appears to regulate the release of leukotrienes in the gut—these molecules help spark an immune response to an allergen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we eat food, most of it is broken down into nutrients for the body to use. But some small amount of it is transported through the gut into the blood as whole proteins, and it’s these whole proteins that can trigger a reaction in someone with a food allergy. “We unexpectedly found that leukotrienes in mice control the amount of whole proteins that are transported across the gut, even in a healthy non-allergic state,” the study authors explained. And scientists already knew that leukotrienes play a part in causing asthma attacks, and several asthma treatments, including zileuton, work by blocking these molecules’ activity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers then gave a dose of zileuton to mice that were allergic to peanuts and then exposed them to their trigger food. They found that the drug blocked the leukotrienes in the mice’s gut from working as usual, thereby decreasing the likelihood of an allergic reaction. All told, 95% of the dosed mice failed to show any sign of anaphylaxis, the researchers reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The studies are in mice, so how the findings translate to people remains to be seen. The authors also caution that zileuton is not a cure for food allergies. That said, if human trials bear out what was seen in the mice, the drug could be used as a prophylactic that some people could take before a high-risk situation where they’re likely to be exposed to such foods. Notably, many people already take zileuton daily for long-term maintenance of their asthma symptoms, suggesting its safety, although it is unclear how its long-term use affects the gut.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If the ongoing clinical trial in humans is successful in showing the drug blocks the same pathway as in mice, the researchers plan to directly test the drug’s ability to prevent anaphylaxis in people with food allergies. Beyond the clinical applications, the research poses other questions, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of other exciting questions, like whether this pathway is regulated by things in our environment, such as changes in the microbiome induced by diet,” Williams and Eisenbarth said.&lt;/p&gt;

Stratus was first detected in Southeast Asia in January, but didn’t show up in U.S. surveillance reports until May. The World Health Organization classified XFG as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/25062025_xfg_ire.pdf?sfvrsn=fab54cd7_1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;” in June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a full picture of COVID-19 activity can be difficult given shifting priorities in federal and state health policy. But several key measures help put together a picture of what’s happening in New York.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC said that as of July 29, its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-modeling-and-forecasting/rt-estimates/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 forecasting models&lt;/a&gt; show infection rates in New York are growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the projections show infections are growing or likely to grow in 40 states and are unchanged in nine others. The highest rates of transmission are in the South, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The public health agency also said COVID &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;viral activity in wastewater&lt;/a&gt; remains “low” nationally, but at least 10 states had “high” or “very high” levels, as of July 12. With 29 sites reporting, viral activity in New York is currently low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the seven-day period ending July 31, 0.7 percent of &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#ed-visits_separated_by_age_group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; in New York had been for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although hoarseness is unique to Stratus, symptoms common to other variants include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, sore throat, congestion and runny nose, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, muscle and body aches, headache, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stratus variant may be better than others at evading immunity protection, according to experts. Although &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine guidance is changing&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC website still says the COVID-19 vaccine helps protect against “severe illness, hospitalization and death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 17:52:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
