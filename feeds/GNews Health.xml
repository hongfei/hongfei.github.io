This is a group of brain disorders that disrupt normal brain development and can lead to intellectual disability, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15148925/epilepsy-cure-childrens-brains.html"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;, movement problems and impulsive behavior, as well as symptoms associated with autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, the conditions are caused when someone only has one functional copy of the SYNGAP1 gene instead of the usual two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, scientists in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-state/index.html" id="mol-076e8d60-a514-11f0-9292-7b50e0f25ff3"&gt;Washington state&lt;/a&gt; say they have found a way to repair the damaged gene and potentially help patients function better in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a new study, researchers administered juvenile mice suffering from the brain disorder with an altered adenovirus, or a cold virus, that carried a healthy copy of the SYNGAP1 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus successfully delivered the gene to brain cells, with the rodents then experiencing broad improvements in their behavior up to two weeks later, including the near elimination of epilepsy, a neurological disorder where patients suffer from recurrent and unprovoked seizures, and a reduction in hyperactive and risky behavior.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mice also saw a substantial shift in their brain wave patterns, or electrical pulses generated by the brain, from abnormal to much closer to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Boaz Levy, a biochemist at the Allen Institute for Brain Science who led the study, said: '[This study] is an important milestone for the field that provides hope for those who suffer from this class of severe neurological diseases.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say they have found a potential new therapy for a brain disorder that can cause autism symptoms in children (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Gene supplementation is providing a functional new copy of a defective gene, a strategy that has great potential for correcting diseases where a gene is completely missing or where a single copy of a gene is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This [study] provides a clear demonstration that SYNGAP1-related disorders can be treated with a neuron-specific gene supplementation strategy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research is in the early stages and was only carried out in mice, with researchers saying clinical trials still need to be done in humans to confirm that the therapy works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But scientists heralded the results as a positive step towards developing a treatment for the condition. It was particularly notable that the study was successful in juvenile mice, which is around the same age at which humans are diagnosed with SRDs and could, therefore, receive treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,500 Americans have been diagnosed with a SYNGAP1-related brain disorder, activists say, although estimates suggest many cases have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not all autism and epilepsy cases are caused by SYNGAP1-related disorders, although patients with SRDs may be diagnosed with these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorders are considered to be a spectrum because the faulty genes often do not affect the brain in exactly the same way or to the same level of severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently no specific treatment or cure for the condition, but doctors say they can help patients to manage symptoms using antiseizure medications or implanting devices into the body that can help to control nerve activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one to two percent of all intellectual disability cases, including autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy, are estimated to be caused by SRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the therapy, a healthy copy of the faulty gene is delivered to brain cells by an adenovirus, or cold virus. It was successful at improving symptoms in juvenile mice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 31 children in the US has autism, a surge on the one in 150 estimated to have the condition in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has suggested that about 80 percent of autism cases are linked to inherited genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Robert F Kennedy Jr, the Health and Human Services Secretary, is among those who have argued that the surge in cases cannot be blamed on genetics alone and is likely also down to unidentified environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 470,000 children in the US have epilepsy, with experts also suggesting that the condition is caused by both genetic and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epilepsy is a common symptom in patients with SYNGAP1-related brain disorders, with more than 80 percent of sufferers also diagnosed with this condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the research, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/pdf/S1525-0016(25)00759-2.pdf?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1525001625007592%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Molecular Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, scientists injected the altered adenoviruses into the mice's cerebral ventricles, the fluid-filled cavities in the center of the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injection was carried out by inserting a needle past the eye and into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Boaz Levy, left, who led the research, and associate investigator Dr Rong Guo and scientist Dr Meagan Quinlan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is the cross section of the brain of a mouse in the study. The highlighted areas represent locations where the adenovirus delivered the treatment to the brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to two weeks later the rodents were put through a battery of tests to measure the impact of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests included tracking the movements of mice in a 7.8inch by 7.8inch arena, to check for erratic behavior, and placing them in an elevated maze and monitoring their behavior to estimate anxiety and risk-taking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team concluded: 'Our findings provide the first evidence that... gene therapy can restore SYNGAP1 function and reverse key [symptoms], supporting its potential as a transformative therapeutic for patients.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Whether you’re aiming to take care of your heart, preserve your cognitive health, or even in a pursuit to shed some pounds, sleep is one of your most reliable allies. Now, while most advice tells you to “get eight hours,” a new large-scale study suggests that how we sleep may matter just as much as how long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to scientists who studied hundreds of adults using brain scans, sleep journals, and lifestyle data, there are five distinct sleeper profiles — and each comes with its own clues about your mental, physical, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revelation is a shift from the one-size-fits-all approach to sleep. It suggests that even two people who sleep the same number of hours might differ drastically in how restorative that sleep is — based on how often they wake, whether they need sleep aids, and how energized (or drowsy) they feel during the day. In short: not all sleepers are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we break down each of the five sleep patterns, explore what they can reveal about your health, and offer ideas on what to do if your sleep type is less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to break the yawn?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 00:32:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxOMDZnOElqOGF5RHE2d2luM0w2VnJxN0JIU1Z6d2h1cmFpRnowSmJiZFVPRXBPa2VrOGVKNzRNZlR0R28yZnN0WGNmNVZwajJBMzl0N3dLbk1TZTB2ZXlRa3FrQjdIckh2cFJrTWNDSkJHeWRaNGRkYnFQeTJTdXFHOUw2a0FkNlNsTWtXLTEtLURQaXpZQjVMMmZEWXl1b0ZaS1hOZ2pNalpTb1dUYTNaUmN5Yy1QQ1BXbjhreXVyNEtNQllpTV9Tb0hCUjI0b3BSR3dJbkw5dVU0VHI4dTNKc3E5S0lVR3FRXzM3cjlhMTNDYnJLNjhBTG5lMkJqOU5QNDAyZU81a3EwN2dkOHYzSmlLcnp6Zk9MT29LWUU5anpWU1dLWkt30gGvAkFVX3lxTE5RcW5GMzY5NzVSem5CSlBSclp4Z0JIWmt5UGRmdEQwNGZkZWhZWmRWZU5ISGFYc0tLUFgwMDVaOG15UTV2b2FhTk1QWE9fY1BONHRKU3RYX19vOXBESlNUYTUzLWZZa1gwbzlpWTFmZHZJdHQ5VGE3d3lSTnJVVkx0bUo0UnNsaTU4ME9qaGk1SHpqa3V1ODBJeThxVWhfcWsxT3V1T2ZZeWR3bjU4aDRTM21QSjFQUkJsZ1VtTXNaMHk5MmNyTmtNYktNOGZwV0Z6cFdfN29jZWRMV003dV9JNURfY0loYktQejdyQTc0VGpJX0hwelo2cHRhWHB3UzJEUS01S19ZQllzM091QUxXWWtPa2l0eUNtM2RUclNQcjFNdEVLa2RqSDMwSm9iZw</guid></item><item><title>日本宇航员从轨道上看到台风| 2025年10月6日至10日，国际空间站-太空</title><link>https://www.space.com/space-exploration/international-space-station/japanese-astronaut-eyes-typhoon-from-orbit-on-the-international-space-station-oct-6-10-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;A PROCLAMATION&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every day, breast cancer upends the lives of countless Americans, subjecting them and their loved ones to unimaginable fear, uncertainty, and heartbreak.  This National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we recognize the resilience and courage of those battling breast cancer—and we reaffirm our commitment to ending this horrific disease once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One in every 8 women in the United States will face breast cancer during their lifetime.  My Administration is determined to end this tragedy.  As part of our historic Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are working to lower cancer rates so that fewer lives, families, and futures will be devastated by cancer’s enduring physical and emotional torment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration urges all Americans to prioritize their health by knowing their family history and other risk factors, using methods of early detection, and implementing preventative protocols and lifestyle changes that may reduce cancer risk. We also commit to the continued prioritization of research and medical advancements that accelerate cures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This month, we rejoice with our Nation’s four million breast cancer survivors, we pray for those who are fighting for remission and healing, and we mourn with all who have lost a precious loved one.  United in purpose, we commit to working towards a healthy, prosperous, and cancer-free American future.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most flu patients do not die from the infection, but rather a complication triggered by the disease. The disease can weaken the immune system, raising the risk of someone suffering from sepsis or pneumonia, which can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flu levels are currently 'minimal' nationwide, according to CDC surveillance, but have risen slightly in four states, including North Carolina. Other states with elevated levels are Connecticut, Illinois and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levels of RSV and norovirus are also low nationwide, but Covid levels are 'moderate', according to wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that as colder weather hits, people will spend more time mixing indoors, allowing respiratory viruses to spread easily between individuals. They say levels are currently low because the nation is in the early stages of the winter virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every year, infections, hospitalizations and deaths from respiratory viruses tend to peak between December and February, before gradually declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, an estimated 40million Americans were infected with the flu, while 400,000 were hospitalized and 25,000 died from complications linked to their infections, in what the CDC called 'one of the worst' flu seasons in over a decade. In that year, cases peaked in early February, before gradually declining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In North Carolina, the state recorded its worst flu season last year since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, registering 544 fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's Department of Health revealed the flu fatality in a press release posted online on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It comes after six counties in California, including Sonoma County (shown above), reimposed their mask mandates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is now urging all residents aged six months and over to ensure they receive a flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also said Covid vaccines were recommended for everyone aged six months and over, even after the Robert F Kennedy-run CDC shifted its guidelines to recommend Covid vaccines to those aged 18 years and older. The agency says parents of children aged six months to 17 years should discuss the benefits of vaccination with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the CDC shows that in the week to September 20, the latest available, there were eight flu-related deaths recorded nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is outside the start of the 2025 to 2026 flu season, which the CDC says begins in October, but indicates that flu deaths were likely recorded elsewhere in the US this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wake County Director of Nursing, Tina Payton, with Wake County being the North Carolina County for Raleigh, the capital of the state in its central area, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abc11.com/post/flu-death-2025-season-nc-person-dies-related-illness-first-influenza-vax-urged-wake-opens-clinic/17965330/"&gt;ABC11&lt;/a&gt;: 'We see more respiratory illnesses as it gets colder and we're headed into that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It gives you a chance to build your immunity before the holidays come up, and that's always a big time where people get together indoors and there's a higher opportunity for illness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes after at least six counties in California's Bay Area&lt;span&gt; -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Contra Costa, Santa Clara, Sonoma, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Cruz - reimposed mask mandates in some health care settings. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lobular breast cancer grows differently than other breast cancers. Instead of forming a distinct lump, its cells spread in dispersed patterns. This makes it more difficult to detect through traditional mammograms and physical exams (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The growth pattern of ILC doesn't make it categorically more aggressive in terms of metastasis, but it makes its spread differently, sometimes later, and to unusual locations, which poses unique &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14150127/mammogram-cancer-incurable-Doctors-reveal-harder-spot-stop-happening-YOU.html"&gt;challenges for detection&lt;/a&gt; and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed national cancer data, comparing invasive lobular breast cancer cases against all other types to track incidence trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using specialized software, they calculated rates and tested for statistical differences in trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also compared patient and tumor characteristics between lobular and ductal cancers and analyzed their ten-year survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While ILC has a similar five-year survival rate to other breast cancers, its long-term outlook is less favorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ten-year survival rate is lower, largely because ILC has a higher risk of late recurrence and tends to spread to uncommon sites in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For lobular cancer that has spread distantly, the 10-year survival rate is only 12.1 percent compared to 19.6 percent for the more common ductal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lobular breast cancer is becoming more common, and its long-term survival rates are low once it spreads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to finding that rates of ILC are rising over three times faster than all other breast cancers, its slight survival advantage in the first few years disappears over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Giaquinto said: ‘Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for [lobular breast cancer] than the most common type of breast cancer, highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This chart tracks lobular breast cancer diagnosis rates across different racial and ethnic groups in the US from 1975 through 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White women had the highest rates across every age group, with risk peaking between ages 70-79 before declining&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors conclude that ILC's unique biology, which makes it harder to detect and potentially less responsive to chemotherapy, requires specific research and clinical attention to improve these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior researcher Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director for cancer surveillance research at the ACS, said: ‘Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are occurring consistently across all age groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uniform pattern is notable because ILC is rising at similar rates in both younger and older populations, unlike some other breast cancer types that typically show more variation between age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers pointed to hormonal and lifestyle risk factors as the main drivers of the increasing incidence over genetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ILC is described as being ‘more strongly associated with female hormone exposure’ than other breast cancers, evidenced by a steeper drop in ILC cases when menopausal women’s use of hormone therapy went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart tracks ten-year ILC survival from 2007 to 2021. While early-stage ILC shows better survival, distant-stage disease survival plummets to just 12 percent compared to 20 percent for ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also specifically pointed to the impacts of increasing rates of excess body weight, a younger age at first menstruation and having fewer children or having a first birth at an older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Factors that extend a woman's lifetime exposure to estrogen, such as a later age at menopause, along with increased alcohol consumption in some groups, are also identified as significant contributors to the growing number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cncr.70061"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the American Cancer Society.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Siegel concluded: ‘Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The scientists report that those who received a shingles vaccine shot were at a definitive health advantage over the control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were less likely to receive a new dementia diagnosis during the next seven years. The analysis made use of a policy quirk to compare people born just before and after a vaccine eligibility cutoff in 2013. This helped separate cause from coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus (&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/varicella-zoster-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;VZV&lt;/a&gt;) can go quiet in nerve cells for decades. Later, it can return as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;herpes zoster&lt;/a&gt;, better known as shingles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After recovery from chickenpox, the virus stays latent in the nervous system and can reactivate as immunity wanes with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-study-actually-tested"&gt;What the study actually tested&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by Pascal Geldsetzer at &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, who studies large health datasets to answer practical questions in medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team focused on people who turned 80 in late 2013, because a small birthday difference determined who could get the shingles vaccine that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers call this a natural experiment. It was a real-world situation that mimicked a trial because a rule or cutoff split otherwise similar people into different groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those just old enough to miss the program served as a comparison group for those barely young enough to be eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing near identical birth cohorts, the analysis made it less likely that differences in health habits or clinic access explained the result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That design choice strengthened the case that the shingles vaccine itself mattered for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-drug-helps-protect-memory-in-brain-diseases-like-alzheimers/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a really striking finding,” said Geldsetzer, summarizing the signal they kept seeing across checks and sensitivity analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-shingles-vaccine-lowers-risk-more"&gt;New shingles vaccine lowers risk more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One idea is simple – fewer viral reactivations may mean less inflammation near nerves and blood vessels that serve the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another idea is broader – vaccination can tune immune pathways that influence brain health in ways not limited to one microbe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; compared the older live vaccine, &lt;a href="https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/zostavax/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zostavax&lt;/a&gt;, with the newer recombinant vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/shingrix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Shingrix&lt;/a&gt;. Shingrix was associated with a 17 percent lower risk of dementia than Zostavax. It also had a lower risk than other common adult vaccines in similar age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shingrix includes an adjuvant, a substance that heightens the immune response to a vaccine’s antigen. That extra kick could be one reason the newer shot shows a stronger association with brain outcomes in population data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Welsh analysis and other large population studies point toward the same conclusion. Shingles vaccination appears to do more than prevent shingles, and the newer recombinant vaccine could be even more effective in lowering &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-shingles-vaccines"&gt;What this means for shingles vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax used a weakened form of the virus and is no longer the routine shingles vaccine in many places. Shingrix, which is a recombinant vaccine given in two doses, has replaced it in standard adult schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zostavax and Shingrix both aim to prevent shingles, yet they work differently. Zostavax uses a live, attenuated virus, while Shingrix uses a viral protein plus an adjuvant to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-trick-immune-system-into-stronger-vaccine-response/"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt; the immune system more directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practical takeaway is simple. A shingles vaccine remains a tool to prevent shingles. Any added protection for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt; is a possible bonus that researchers are still testing, not a reason to treat vaccination as a dementia drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-next-steps"&gt;Limits and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Welsh analysis used routine health records, which can miss or delay diagnoses. The design, however, focused on people born only a week apart around the policy cutoff time, which helps balance many hidden differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biology is not settled. Reduced viral reactivation could be part of the story, and immune training unrelated to the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/first-cases-of-tropical-virus-oropouche-spread-by-mosquito-are-recorded-in-uk/"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; could be another part. Both are testable in future mechanistic studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia affects tens of millions of people. According to a recent WHO &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;factsheet&lt;/a&gt;, there are about 57 million people worldwide living with dementia, with nearly 10 million new cases each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-think-about-risk-and-causality"&gt;How to think about risk and causality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational studies can be skewed if people who get vaccinated also do other healthy things. This project reduced that concern by using an eligibility threshold to compare very similar groups separated by a quirk of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the cleanest proof comes from randomized trials that assign the shot or a placebo and follow people over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of trial would show whether vaccination delays &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; onset, and by how much, across different ages and risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Population level findings are useful for public health decisions. For individuals, the decision to vaccinate should still rest on the proven benefit of preventing shingles and its complications. Any decision should first be discussed with a clinician who knows your medical history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 17:31:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPNnY3YS04V0pHdzhxYjBxTUZTLUdTRkhLaHk3SWlhZEpBUGJQR3NOOVd2TTBKbDF1U0J4NC1tM2JZVDhyUkhIQjFWNEh5a1FwelE0X3BuNkc4RllicFMyZDBVNUR4TTVvYnotWVN0ZnNmS1Bta1JENFBMU0ZtRTVlV2o3T3lITEJsYnRGY3diY3pBTHk4Y2FRZUZEQ0pjbk41N1M5M1pGM0p0MkU2NVI4</guid></item><item><title>我的姻亲对我的孩子非常不负责任。我很害怕，但我丈夫说这没什么大不了的。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/10/parenting-advice-in-laws-alcohol-problem.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

Apparently, this has been going on for months!&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkyki0p000o3b7860bsu99i@published"&gt;The worst part? My husband, “Walter,” thinks it’s no big deal. He even admitted that &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; parents let him do the same thing at David’s age! His excuse is that it’s “just one beer with dinner” and they’re not letting him get drunk—so it’s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="35" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkykjrl000r3b78zac2o0hn@published"&gt;I disagree entirely. I told my in-laws that David—and his younger brother—will not be visiting them for the foreseeable future. Now Walter, his parents, and even David are ganging up on me, claiming I’m overreacting.&lt;/p&gt;

However, try to be understanding of your husband’s position; his parents let him drink as a kid and thus, he doesn’t see a problem with it. His family’s position isn’t exactly unique, as there are some folks who think it’s better to let a young person experiment with alcohol at home than to let them discover it on the streets. Explain to him kindly that drinking a beer with family can easily be a gateway to sneaking booze behind your backs and that you do not want to send your son the message that drinking at 15 is OK.&lt;/p&gt;

Let your in-laws know that you are not wavering on your stance, and that your boys can’t visit with them until you have their word that they won’t allow them to drink until they are of age. Tell your sons that your rule may not be fun, but it is designed to keep them alive and from harming others. Everyone can be mad at you if they want, but you know that what you are doing is in your children’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgkydfiz000ki0j8yyijt6l7@published"&gt;When I first met my husband, he told me he’d never touched a drink, never smoked, and never taken any sort of drug. He had a family history of addiction, and having seen what it does to people, he decided it probably wasn’t worth it. As someone who never became addicted to alcohol but partied a bit too hard in my early 20s, I really respected that. He never asked that I not drink, though by the time I met him, I wasn’t going out often anyways. Over time, his relationship with his alcoholic mother grew worse until we had to cut her out of our lives entirely, and his sister recently died of a drug overdose. He’s since become a health fanatic. We have three kids between the ages of 13 and 9. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/05/health-obsessed-dad-parenting-advice-from-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;He’s now obsessed with perceived unhealthiness in our family, and it’s doing something really strange to our kids.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, only one-in-four people with a history of high blood pressure have this condition under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In August 2025, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology released &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;new guidelines on prevention and management of hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, based on a comprehensive analysis of literature published over the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Conversation U.S. asked &lt;a href="https://som.cuanschutz.edu/Profiles/Faculty/Profile/24559" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cardiologist Dr. William Cornwell&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus to explain what the new guidelines mean, and how you can work with your doctor to manage your blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why did blood pressure guidelines change?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most recent guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000065" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prior to this new statement were in 2017;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prior to this new statement were in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Since that time, the medical community has learned a lot about hypertension and the best way to control it. The new guidelines provide a great deal of new information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;First, the definition of hypertension has changed: The criteria are more strict, and the target blood pressures are lower than in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The criteria depend on the values of the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/which-blood-pressure-number-is-important" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;“systolic” and the “diastolic” pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Systolic blood pressure, the top number, represents the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is squeezing blood into the body. Diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number, is the pressure in the blood vessels when the heart is relaxing. Both numbers are important when determining the severity of hypertension and how it is most appropriately managed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines have removed the category of “prehypertension,” which was defined by a systolic pressure of 120 to 139 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or a diastolic pressure of 80 to 99 mm Hg. Now, patients are categorized as having “elevated blood pressure” if their blood pressure is 120 to 129 over less than 80 mm Hg, or stage 1 hypertension if they are 130 to 139/80 to 89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A reading of 140/90 or more is considered stage 2 hypertension, and a reading of 180/120 or greater is a hypertensive crisis. In essence, the bar has been lowered, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25466" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this change may impact millions of Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this change may impact millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People need to ask their doctors if they have hypertension based on these new criteria, and whether or not they should be treated. It is also very important for patients to get advice from their doctors about lifestyle habits that they can incorporate into their daily routine, like diet, exercise and healthy sleep habits to help &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;lower blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition, the guidelines encourage providers to use a risk calculator, called PREVENT — short for &lt;a href="https://professional.heart.org/en/guidelines-and-statements/prevent-risk-calculator/prevent-calculator" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease EVENTS&lt;/a&gt; — to determine a patient’s overall risk of cardiovascular disease and heart failure. This tool represents a significant advance in personalizing medical care, since it incorporates risk factors unique to the individual, allowing for a tailored approach to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What’s the link between alcohol intake and high blood pressure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines encourage people to limit alcohol intake because alcohol increases blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis of seven studies with nearly 20,000 people showed that systolic blood pressure will &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase by about 1 mm Hg for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed&lt;/a&gt;. A standard beer contains about 14 grams of alcohol, so regular alcohol consumption may increase blood pressure by several points over time. For people who have been consistently drinking excessive amounts of alcohol but later stop drinking, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/01.HYP.33.2.653" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:their blood pressure may come back down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;their blood pressure may come back down&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That might not sound like much of an impact, but when combined with other unhealthy and risky behaviors, like sedentary behavior, excessive weight, inadequate sleep, psychological stress, and smoking, the risk factors start to add up quickly. Together, they can very quickly &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines encourage patients to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt;, compared with the old guidelines. For people who do want to drink alcohol, the new guidelines recommend that men should drink no more than two drinks per day, and women should drink no more than one drink per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What other lifestyle factors did the new report focus on?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The new guidelines also emphasize the fact that diet can have a major impact on blood pressure. They recommend that all adults — with or without hypertension — consume less than 2,300 milligrams of salt, or approximately 1 teaspoon, per day, and more ideally, less than 1,500 milligrams per day. For a comparison, the average &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American eats more than 3,300 milligrams of salt&lt;/a&gt; per day. Patients may also consider potassium-based salt substitutes to further lower blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines recommend a specific diet called the &lt;a href="https://katiecouric.com/health/how-to-lower-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DASH diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, short for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, for patients with or without hypertension to prevent or treat elevated blood pressure.

But it’s &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; helpful for people with multiple chronic conditions, like hypertension, high cholesterol, overweight/obesity, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The American Heart Association recommends &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eight essential health behaviors;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eight essential health behaviors&lt;/a&gt; for controlling blood pressure and reducing risk of cardiovascular disease overall: These include healthy diet, regular exercise, stopping or avoiding smoking, sleeping seven to nine hours per night, and controlling weight, cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Will the new guidelines change how doctors address high blood pressure?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One of the greatest advances with these new guidelines is the personalized approach to medical care through the use of the PREVENT calculator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The guidelines recommend that doctors encourage their patients to check blood pressure at home to better understand the fluctuations in pressure that occur throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, the guidelines encourage physicians to be more aggressive about treating blood pressure. This may be an important change, since uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for eventual development of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;William Cornwell is an associate professor of cardiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many survey-based studies have been conducted to try to understand how happiness changes over a person's lifetime. While there have been a few different outcomes, the most common has been the U-shaped curve. This pattern indicates that, on average, people are happier at the beginning of adulthood, they experience a dip during midlife (the so-called "midlife crisis"), and happiness then increases again in old age. Yet, other similar studies have reported inconsistent patterns—steady happiness throughout life, steady increases, steady decreases or even inverse U-shapes.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Now, Fabian Kratz and Josef Brüderl from Ludwig the Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, argue that the widely reported U-shape is largely an artifact of methodological biases, instead of a robust empirical pattern. Their study, recently &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/esr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/esr/jcaf038/8262529" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;European Sociological Review&lt;/i&gt;, describes a different pattern, in which happiness declines slowly through adulthood, slightly increases in the early 60s (or the "golden ages"), then declines steeply in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, the team sought to find an explanation for the variance among studies in happiness versus age patterns and to determine a set of "best practices" for working with these kinds of studies. They used &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/survey+data/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;survey data&lt;/a&gt; from the long-term German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), taken from 1984 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say, "The social sciences have faced a challenge regarding the replication of research findings, raising concerns about the credibility of results. An illustrative case pertains to research on age-related changes in subjective well-being (SWB)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to remedy this problem, they decided to take a different route than their predecessors. "This study aims to demonstrate how insights from the modern causal inference literature can help explain the contradictory findings in this research field. We use these insights to develop a theoretically informed and empirically validated &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/research+design/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;research design&lt;/a&gt;, to which we refer as the 'best-practice design.'"&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their work involves identifying a set of common biases, including things like social desirability, in which participants report higher happiness levels due to societal expectations. Survivorship bias is another common problem in these studies. As people get older, those that are unhappy tend to have more &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+issues/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health issues&lt;/a&gt; or may die by suicide, leaving the healthier and happier people to continue filling out surveys, and thus creating the upward happiness trend in late life.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The team also wanted to avoid overcontrol, by not controlling mediators like health or employment. They say, "Overcontrol occurs when analysts control for mediating variables—i.e., variables caused by age that also affect SWB. A growing body of causal inference literature clearly demonstrates that controlling for mediating mechanisms distorts estimates of total causal effects. The rationale is clear: including such variables distorts the causal effect by explaining away part of its mechanism."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prove that these biases lead to the results from prior studies, the team also replicated older results using different combinations of biases and what they believe were misspecifications of data. They say the U-shape is a common result of these designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, their improved best-practice design results in the steep decline of happiness after the late-60s. They also find no evidence for the midlife crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Overall, our findings do not support the notion of a U-curve, at least not in the sense in which it is often conceived. There is no basis for concluding that people in old age become happier again. Even the small increase during the golden ages can hardly be interpreted as evidence of a U-curve, since SWB remains well below happiness levels in the 20s, and the sharp decline follows immediately. Furthermore, we would argue that the dip in happiness around age 58 can hardly be interpreted as an indication of a midlife crisis, since the decline in happiness is gradual throughout adulthood," the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is no definitive, objective way to measure happiness. Subjective reports may be unreliable, and even if they are not, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/happiness/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;happiness&lt;/a&gt; over a lifetime can also vary by culture and location. The study authors note these limitations, as their data is only based on German surveys. They also note that compositional variables or contextual factors may not be fully captured.&lt;/p&gt;

In 2020, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-6b0305f0-a5d6-11f0-b5dc-0395410c7ef4"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recorded 2,168 cases of congenital syphilis. By 2024, that number rose to 3,941. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the agency, this is the highest number of cases of the disease since 1992. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors believe the rise is being driven by lack of access to general medical care and education, as well as by pregnant women not receiving prenatal care and testing and not following up with treatment after testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly 40 percent of pregnant women who tested positive did not receive any or adequate treatment, according to new CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cases of congenital syphilis have more than tripled in recent years, with 3,882 cases reported in 2023 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pregnant women’s sexual partners who don’t receive STD screening or treatment also contribute to the rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And many infected people will show no symptoms of the infection.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forty-three percent of birth parents did not receive syphilis testing during their pregnancy and 23 percent were not treated for a positive case. This contributed to almost 90 percent of congenital syphilis cases across the US in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For nine in 10 cases of the STD in infants, testing and treatment during pregnancy might have prevented the transmission of the potentially deadly disease to newborns, Johns Hopkins estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the outbreak, the city of Baltimore awarded Johns Hopkins $225,000 in 2024 to help provide testing and care to at-risk or infected individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Head of Johns Hopkins' Center for Communication Programs August Summers said during the announcement: 'We will be bringing awareness about the issue to Baltimore, both to people who are pregnant and their partners who likely also need treatment, as well as to providers to help improve counseling and testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is a possibility of infant death, and that’s really what we want to prevent above all else.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syphilis is an STD contracted during sex that causes skin rashes and sores &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primary syphilis sores begin at the infection site such as the mouth or genitals. Secondary syphilis rashes appear on the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis can cause symptoms such as bone deformities, jaundice, rashes and lesions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, both syphilis and congenital syphilis are preventable by using condoms during sex and can be treated by the antibiotic penicillin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When left untreated, the disease can lead to neurological problems, premature and stillbirths, and after-birth death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health agencies have recommendations for syphilis testing, providing self or at-home STD tests to expand the options for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Dineen, assistant Baltimore health commissioner for maternal and child health, said officials were focused for years on the pandemic, rather than on congenital syphilis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every state recommends a test in the first trimester, 18 states recommend it for the third, and nine recommend it post-birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only eight states mandate syphilis screenings after delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, syphilis rates among African Americans are some of the highest in the US and Baltimore's population is 60 percent African American. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pandemic may have also played a part because health leaders were more focused on Covid than other infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca Dineen, assistant Baltimore health commissioner for maternal and child health, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thebanner.com/community/public-health/congenital-syphilis-babies-sti-mothers-YJVMTFAMPJGMTE4CNYOARG3OXI/"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;The Baltimore Banner: 'We went through the pandemic, and our eye was not on congenital syphilis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC states: 'Increasing rates of syphilis among babies reflect a failure of the US health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Testing for and treating syphilis during pregnancy more than 30 days before delivery can prevent this infection in newborns. Too many people are not being tested and treated early enough during pregnancy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only cure for congenital syphilis is the antibiotic benzathine penicillin, which is administered by injection. However, it is currently facing a worldwide shortage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This pattern differs enough from that of neurotypical adults that a machine learning algorithm was able to accurately classify individuals with ADHD based on these visual traits with over 90 percent accuracy. The same approach was also able to distinguish whether a person with ADHD regularly takes stimulant medication. These findings indicate that ADHD may involve a consistent, underlying difference in how the brain handles brief moments of perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by symptoms such as inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. It affects around 3 to 4 percent of Canadian adults and about 2.6 percent of adults worldwide. While researchers have known for some time that ADHD influences attention, memory, and executive functioning, less is known about how it affects the brain’s handling of incoming sensory information—especially how that processing changes from one moment to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies using brainwave recordings have shown that people with ADHD often display different patterns of electrical activity, particularly in the alpha and theta frequency bands. However, these findings have not always been consistent. To better understand the functional impacts of such oscillations, the researchers behind this new study used a method called random temporal sampling, which allows them to track how efficiently someone processes visual information across tiny slices of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their goal was to explore whether ADHD is associated with a distinct rhythm or timing in visual perception, which could reflect underlying neural oscillations. If such a rhythm exists and is consistent across individuals with ADHD, it could provide a new behavioral marker for identifying the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In light of the relatively high incidence of ADHD, there is surprisingly little that we know about it for sure,” said study author Martin Arguin, a professor of psychology at the University of Montreal and director of &lt;a href="https://www.neurocognitionvisionlab.org/en" target="_blank"&gt;the Neurocognitive Vision Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is especially true of the neural bases of the disorder. My lab had recently brought to maturity the technique of random temporal sampling, which serves to capture temporal variations in perceptual efficiency. Given that these temporal variations can be assumed originate from oscillatory neural activity, we thought that examining ADHD from this perspective might bring a positive contribution to our knowledge of the disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited young adult participants from two colleges in Quebec. A total of 49 people were included in the final analysis: 26 were neurotypical controls and 23 had received a formal ADHD diagnosis. Among those with ADHD, 17 regularly used stimulant medication while six did not. All participants had normal or corrected vision and completed a battery of visual tasks under controlled conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central experiment involved briefly showing participants a series of five-letter French words overlaid with visual noise. The visibility of each word varied rapidly during the 200 milliseconds it appeared on the screen. Participants were asked to read the word aloud, and researchers recorded whether they were correct. The contrast of the noise was continuously adjusted so that each participant would average about 50 percent correct responses, ensuring a balanced challenge across individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What set this experiment apart was how the noise varied. It wasn’t static; instead, the signal-to-noise ratio changed throughout the 200-millisecond window in a pattern composed of multiple sine waves at different frequencies. This random fluctuation allowed researchers to analyze how well participants could extract the word at each moment in time, depending on the frequency of the noise changes. The technique generated what are called classification images—maps showing how efficiently each person processed the visual input at different times and frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the classification images of those with and without ADHD, the researchers could examine whether there were consistent group differences in the rhythm of visual processing. They then used a machine learning model trained on features extracted from these classification images to see if it could distinguish between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The classification images revealed consistent differences in visual processing patterns between participants with ADHD and those without. Although the general structure of visual processing looked similar across both groups, certain frequencies showed marked differences. These included processing oscillations at 5, 10, and 15 cycles per second (Hz), particularly when the noise in the stimulus oscillated at 30 to 40 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immediate implication of our results is that, in ADHD, there seems to be a systematic divergence in visual function from that of individuals with typical development,” Arguin told PsyPost. “This divergence points to a difference in brain function that has yet to be clearly determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these patterns were fed into a machine learning algorithm, it was able to classify individuals as either ADHD or neurotypical with 91.8 percent accuracy, using only about 3 percent of the total features. The sensitivity (the algorithm’s ability to correctly identify ADHD participants) was over 96 percent, while its specificity (the ability to correctly identify neurotypical individuals) was 87 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The literature largely emphasizes the individual differences among persons with ADHD as a potential indicator of varied causes for the disorder,” Arguin said. “Our findings rather indicate that we can actually classify 100% of our participants into their respective group (i.e. ADHD vs typical development) from their individual data patterns pertaining to perceptual oscillations; thereby pointing to a possibly unique cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This high classification rate in itself was also rather unexpected. However, at the time we carried out the data analyses, we had already completed a similarly designed project comparing perceptual oscillations across young vs elderly participants with normal cognitive functioning (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1323493" target="_blank"&gt;Lévesque &amp;amp; Arguin, 2024&lt;/a&gt;). In that study too, we found an accuracy of 100% in the classification of individual participants into their respective group based on their patterns of perceptual oscillations. This somewhat contributed to raise our expectations for the outcomes of the ADHD study.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined whether the algorithm could tell apart individuals with ADHD who were on stimulant medication from those who were not. Despite the small sample size, the model performed well, achieving 91.3 percent accuracy. It was particularly sensitive to identifying those taking medication, with 100 percent accuracy in that subgroup. Only a few features were needed to make this distinction, suggesting that regular medication use has a measurable effect on the timing of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, when the researchers directly compared the classification images of medicated and unmedicated participants with ADHD, they did not find statistically significant differences using traditional statistical methods. However, the machine learning approach was able to detect consistent patterns, indicating that the medication status leaves subtle but consistent traces in the visual processing rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, the findings indicate “that there is a particular pattern to perceptual oscillations that seems to uniquely characterize most, if not all, persons with ADHD,” Arguin explained. “This fact suggests that there may be a single atypical brain mechanism underlying ADHD. This is at variance from a large portion of the relevant literature, which seems to assume a variety of potential causes in attempting to account for sometimes significant individual differences among ADHD sufferers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings are promising, the study has some limitations. The sample size was modest, especially for the comparison between medicated and non-medicated ADHD participants. Larger and more diverse samples are needed to confirm the generalizability of the results. The participants were mostly young adults, so it is not yet clear whether similar patterns would be found in older adults or children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another issue is that while the classification method was very effective, the specific link between the observed visual processing patterns and underlying neural mechanisms remains unclear. The classification images are thought to reflect brain oscillations, but this assumption has not yet been directly tested using brain imaging techniques. Future studies could combine this behavioral method with electroencephalography or functional MRI to identify the brain regions and networks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also point out that the task they used—a repetitive word recognition task with limited cognitive flexibility—may have made it especially sensitive to the effects of ADHD and medication. It remains to be seen whether similar processing differences would appear in more complex or varied tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings suggest that random temporal sampling may offer a powerful and objective tool for identifying ADHD. The ability to classify individuals with such high accuracy, based on a brief visual task, suggests that there may be a single core difference in perceptual timing that characterizes the condition. This idea stands in contrast to much of the current literature, which tends to emphasize individual differences and multiple potential causes for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the technique proves reliable in broader populations and under different testing conditions, it could eventually be adapted into a clinical tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on our investigation in adults with ADHD, we are now pursuing a related study to examine whether we can replicate its findings in children in the age range where an assessment for possible ADHD is most often sought (10-14 year olds),” Arguin explained. “If so, it would indicate that random temporal sampling could constitute an excellent test for the assessment of ADHD. Such a test could eventually prove very useful in the current context where: 1. access to the relevant specialists is often very difficult; 2. assessment for possible ADHD may be very costly; 3. the diagnosis of ADHD is based on symptomatology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310605" target="_blank"&gt;Visual processing oscillates differently through time for adults with ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, Martin Arguin, Hélène Brisebois, and Nathalie Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 15:05:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOU2FFY2o2Qi12cWUwcDRPeXYzRk5DeGxTUklkYTl2OHZwSkVFcXJCRnJyX0hiNUw0ZU1EQUpXU1hZdGVDWHBoNG1sT1NJSUhXS3psSGQ1RE1xSEpkTTQ0WVdoQW1vS2ctd3pLNmVWd3Z5bHFwMzJ5cEdVeDFWM1cwbWZhQnc5WlktU3pyazdQMHhiNmE0bS04bTVfNlgyckZZQmUtN2o5Q05Kc3BNQWhGTQ</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家：在治疗心脏病发作20年后，您“付不起钱让我吃”的9种美国食物- MSN</title><link>https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/nutrition/cardiologist-9-american-foods-you-couldn-t-pay-me-to-eat-after-20-years-of-treating-heart-attacks/ar-AA1OdES0</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Lost down a dramatic rabbit hole of late-night Google searches, prompted by a headache or pain that just won't quit. One minute, we're calmly checking our symptoms. The next, we're having a panic attack and mentally drawing up our last wishes - convinced we've got a fatal case of some &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/topics/rare-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;rare disease&lt;/a&gt;, and have months, if not days, left to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;Thanks to the internet, it would seem like a medical degree is no longer needed to make a diagnosis. Armed with WebMD, MayoClinic, TikTok, and a false sense of confidence, ordinary "experts" believe they have it all figured out. But often, it's this very determination that leads to hilarious, and sometimes disastrous, results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;Someone once &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt;, "&lt;strong&gt;What was the MOST incorrect self-diagnosis you've encountered in your practice?&lt;/strong&gt;" and judging by the answers, the real doctors out there have seen it all… From a patient who was convinced they had a bee in their eye, to another who claimed they'd had 20 heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt; has put together a compilation of the best of the worst &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/doctors-dealing-patients-googled-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;self-diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; cases doctors have witnessed. While some are funny, others are quite the opposite.

Symptom checkers, self-diagnosis, and the like are often inaccurate and can even cause bigger problems than the one/s you think you have.

For example, in 2015, over a third of American adults regularly used the internet for self-diagnosis, as &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/checking-symptom-checkers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the National Institutes of Health.

Then, in 2019, PhillyVoice &lt;a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/new-survey-finds-googling-symptoms-problematic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on a study that revealed the number could be up to 65%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"35% of those who used the Internet to determine the medical condition of themselves or someone else didn’t visit a clinician for a diagnosis.

My wife tells me that I fall onto the floor and my arms and legs start jerking. She says it takes about a minute of her massaging before it stops.

Hope you won't find this out of place. I had a client come in several years ago with a dog suffering from flea allergy dermatitis. These dogs have an allergy to flea saliva that causes them to get insanely itchy - primarily around the rear end and base of the tail. This poor little guy had chewed his fur out to the point that his back half was just about completely naked. So there he sits scratching and biting at himself, covered in fleas, several of which I have combed off of him and showed his owner. "Good news," I say. "We can fix this." After explaining the diagnosis, his owner proceeded to tell me how foolish I was - the dog was not itchy because of fleas. He was chewing at himself as a psychological response to the disturbance caused by having his butt shaved by an unknown intruder who must have broken into the house while they were away. I had no response to that other than to agree, that, yes, that must have been very traumatic for him. Ultimately we agreed to treat for the fleas, just in case. Shockingly, the dog got better.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crkzvqx/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/a-veterinarian-examines-a-beagle-dog-with-a-stetho-VDF3D6Y" target="_blank"&gt; viktelminova/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-3/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471956"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471956" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-4-68e778c882bb6__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Elderly woman in medical gown consulting a doctor, illustrating common situations of self-diagnosis versus professional diagnosis." title="Elderly woman in medical gown consulting a doctor, illustrating common situations of self-diagnosis versus professional diagnosis." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Just finished med school, so not too much experience, but had an elderly woman come in the ER with new onset seizure.

Her baby had diarrhea for the last few weeks and wasn't going away. She initially wasn't concerned but then her friend told her that diarrhea is the first sign of AIDS and now she was convinced her baby contracted AIDS. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We quickly ruled that out through their med records and assured her that her baby didn't contract AIDS randomly. As we finished examining the baby it started to cry so we handed it to her mother. Lo and behold she pulls out a baby bottle to get the baby to stop crying....only this baby bottle is red and is filled with Kool-Aid. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We had to explain to her that babies can't handle sugar at that age and that was the cause of the diarrhea. She refused to believe what we said. "I was raised on Kool-Aid and look at me I'm fine". &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Man the south side of Chicago is a completely different world. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit: Another story from that clinic. A lady came in and after she got off the scale she asked what her weight was at. She ~10 pounds heavier than the previous visit and seemed upset. So I asked her what about her weight was bothering her. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;She said she was trying to lose weight but it didn't seem like her diet was working. I casually asked what her diet was thinking she was trying some of the new diets. Her answer was "Bacon". Her friend told her that if she added bacon to all her meals she'd lose weight so she had been eating Bacon 4-5x/day for the last month. She was shocked when she learned that she was doing the exact opposite of what she was supposed to do. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Edit 2: The reason these 2 cases come to mind is because I was shocked by the lack of common knowledge. These people aren't dumb they just didn't know what they were doing was wrong. It's a symptom of poverty and a lack of education. Both patients took the proper step's to correcting their misunderstandings and were admittedly embarrassed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As far as the race questions go. I now work in a rural, majority white, part of the midwestern U.S with similar levels of poverty/education as the South Side of Chicago and these patients have the same issues. They just don't know.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crkz7jw/" target="_blank"&gt; DemonEyesKyo &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/premium-photo/stethoscope-folders-desk-medical-office-closeup_419708973.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=35&amp;amp;uuid=276283bf-783a-4046-be2c-f4acec6c1995&amp;amp;query=clinic" target="_blank"&gt; New Africa/Freepik (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-5/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471963"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471963" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-8-68e77c1b6b280__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Male doctor examining patient's leg in clinic, illustrating common cases of people self-diagnosing their health issues." title="Male doctor examining patient's leg in clinic, illustrating common cases of people self-diagnosing their health issues." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Self-diagnosis?

I had fallen asleep and forgot to take my contacts out. I wake up and my eyes were really hurting. I go to the bathroom to take out my contacts. I claw at my left eye and eventually manage to remove the lense. I do the same thing to my right eye, clawing at it trying to remove the lense. Eventually I realise there isn't even a contact lense in my eye, so I freak out thinking it had somehow slid up behind my eye. I claw at my eye even more, digging around for my contact lense. I still didn't find it. A few hours later my eye is driving me crazy and hurts like hell. So I get my parents to take me to a walk in clinic. They basically tell me I'm an idiot and that contact lenses can't go behind your eye, and apparently in my sleep I must have scratched it out of my eye. Also I scratched my eye up so bad it got infected and I went blind in that eye for about a week... Everything is fine now, but now I know not to sleep with contact lenses in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TLDR; fell asleep with contact lense in, scratched eye really bad, went blind for a week.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl0ljx/" target="_blank"&gt; GuitarGodGavin &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/irritated-red-bloodshot-human-eye-looking-at-camer-EVFU8C4" target="_blank"&gt; SergioPhotone/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-32/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kopp admits that Google should never replace a real doctor's visit. Information gleaned from the internet is only part of the equation, he says, adding that the skill and expertise of the doctor is what matters the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way Google can help is when a patient arrives at their doctor appointment armed with accurate research. "Online medical research can empower people to take control of their health – and help doctors deliver more targeted, more impactful care," Kopp wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472002"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472002" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Veterinary Technician here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twice I have had people worried that their dog's abdomen was "covered in ticks". Turns out both times to be the nipples. One of them stated someone told them to try to burn the "ticks" off. Another one asked why their male dog had nipples and why they had never seen them before. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another one was a guy that brought his 3 year old beautiful spaniel in because he saw "tapeworms all over his rear end". Dog comes in severely lethargic and with a diaper on (dog also had severe diarrhea). When I pulled back the diaper... maggots. Everywhere. He said he googled a picture of tapeworms and that's what it looked like. Uh, no. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dog apparently had a small wound near his rear that got infested with maggots and by putting the diaper on, it only exacerbated the problem. Dog ended up passing later that evening after spending hours removing the maggots, shaving hair, and administering every medication we could. We told the guy next time to not Google things and bring in his pets immediately if there is ever anything that seems off. I think he learned his lesson.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl3f9a/" target="_blank"&gt; pardonmypistola &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-53/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-15"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to Google your symptoms, experts say you should be mindful of the words you use. Stick to basic keywords, &lt;a href="https://www.phillyvoice.com/new-survey-finds-googling-symptoms-problematic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Nine Shapiro, author of "Hype: A Doctor's Guide to Medical Myths, Exaggerated Claims, and Bad Advice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shapiro says that by doing so, you start with the most possibilities and can narrow down to the most probable diagnoses. You should also use medical terms like "abdominal pain" instead of typing in something like "upset tummy." This is more likely to lead you to accurate medical sites instead of a page that'll take you down the wrong road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you have serious concerns about your health, the wisest thing to do is go straight to a real, qualified doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472011"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472011" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;My friend went to the ER after hours of complaining of feeling something like bugs crawling on his eye.

I took a look. She had breast cancer that was so advanced that it was ulcerating through the skin in an area about the size of a small orange. I'll never forget seeing that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's such a shame because she was such a lovely lady. We talked for about half an hour and during that I found that she had put it down to a lot of stress overwhelming her life lately to do with her son leaving home and a few other things. She seemed like a spiritual lady, and she was so sensitive and overwhelmed at the time that I had to take things very slow with her. During that 30 minutes I really felt that I connected with her and slowly helped her understand what was actually going on and that the next few weeks would be tough with treatments etc.&lt;br&gt;This was about a month after I had started as a junior doctor. The next day I got a complaint to my supervisor by the head nurse for taking too long with a patient, plus a whole lot of other made up stuff about being unprofessional etc to make her claim sound better. Had to go to meetings with management etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, the reason the patient couldn't walk was because of high calcium from metastases all through her bones. I treated that and she was able to walk again a few days later. I looked up her file about three months after and she was still alive, on hormone therapy to slow the cancer's progression.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl2mfx/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/people-waiting-to-visit-doctor-in-front-of-recepti-WEKRS9H" target="_blank"&gt; beautifulmomentstudio23/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-29/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471985"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471985" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-17-68e7a66ea0a67__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Older woman self-diagnosing her illness while consulting a medical professional in a clinical setting about her symptoms." title="Older woman self-diagnosing her illness while consulting a medical professional in a clinical setting about her symptoms." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Not a Dr, but a pharmacist so I hope I'm allowed to play. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patient had a cold, convinced it was "severe sinusitis" (a bit of a known hypochondriac). Saw Dr, got script for antibiotic. Was convinced she was allergic to every antibiotic tried until all that was left was antibiotics which aren't usually used in URTIs at a sub-therapeutic dose (because she's "very sensitive to medications"). The infection wasn't going away so she took antibiotics for longer and longer. She somehow got her hands on a blood glucose machine and must have had a reading that was slightly low one day because all of a sudden she started buying bags and bags of jelly beans because "the infection is making my blood sugar go dangerously low" (fasting ~4mmol/L, so normal). So she is taking more and more glucose (moved onto the straight glucose powder now) to control the "dumping syndrome" (I don't think she even read the Wiki on that one...) that the infection caused. Symptom of her "dumping syndrome": blood glucose dropping rapidly (because she is on a diet consisting of pretty much solely pure glucose) to "dangerous levels" (~4mmol/L). She is testing her blood glucose on average 20 times a day and taking about 250gm of pure glucose at least (from us) plus supplementing with lollies from the supermarket for some variety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've consulted with the Dr. Nobody can convince her otherwise, we've all tried. She's put on ~15kg in the last month or so and will definitely end up with diabetes soon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr made a mistake the other day. In exasperation she said to her (in her 3rd appointment that month) "You should count yourself lucky, there are people far worse than you that can't even get out of bed". Nek minnit, she now gets deliveries because she is so sick she can't get out of bed...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tl;dr - Lady had a cold is now giving herself diabetes by living on pretty much just simple sugars.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl6t6l/" target="_blank"&gt; Sarcastic_Pharm &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/senior-woman-sneezing-in-tissue-in-pharmacy-H8FRYYW" target="_blank"&gt; gpointstudio/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-36/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471959"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471959" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Patient is diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, confirmed with biopsy.

Her and her boyfriend had Googled her symptoms, and at 19 you're never wrong. When I suggested that perhaps we check an EBV antibody to rule out mono, she looked at me like I was actively drooling on myself and refused, because there was, "No way I can have mono." Eventually I convinced her to have some diagnostic testing done, and sure enough she had mono. I tried to explain that having oral thrush as a 19 year old could possibly be much more concerning than mononucleosis, but she didn't seem to get it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EDIT: I will give the caveat that if a patient volunteers that they were looking up their symptoms online, I'll always ask them what they think they have and why. This can sometimes give insight to symptoms or concerns they may not have let on about that help me to make a correct diagnosis.

I provided them with books, hand outs, etc. They insisted on going to see my co-worker and a psychiatrist as I was surely lying to them.

He'd been putting on weight again for a while, and decided to get back into lifting. Gets severe abdominal pain, thinks he tore something. Eventually my sister convinces him to visit his go, who gets him an ultrasound. One look at the ultrasound, and they've got him booked for an MRI that day. Wait here. You shouldn't leave the building. Phones my sister, mostly care free, who then stars freaking out, because she works as a receptionist in a medical clinic. She knows they don't actually fast track you through tests the same day for no reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Turns out the reason he wasn't losing weight again was because of the mass roughly the size of an Aussie rules football on his stomach. Doc orders a biopsy, hopefully it's benign. Doc gets the results, consults cancer specialist, and schedules to take it out in two weeks time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After they get home, cancer doc called them back and says, let's move that up to tomorrow. Turns out it was a really fare form of cancer, that the specialist had to look up the literature on. Extremely fast growing, super rare cancer with a name I can't remember, because it's about twenty letters long.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually they remove a 3kg mass, along with part of his stomach. On chemo for a while, and six month check ups for the rest of his life, but otherwise good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunny side up, it's now real easy for him to lose weight.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl7b2m/" target="_blank"&gt; Tradyk &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-70/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471983"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471983" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-15-68e7a51fb8430__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Female doctor using stethoscope to examine male patient, illustrating self-diagnosed health misconceptions corrected by professionals." title="Female doctor using stethoscope to examine male patient, illustrating self-diagnosed health misconceptions corrected by professionals." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Someone thought they had "a strained muscle in their leg" because it locked up and they couldn't bend their knee, then an abscess formed at the top of their leg right at the pelvic bone, and blood/pus started literally *pouring* out, non-stop, for days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eventually he came to the doctor's office, then straight to the ER, and had an abscess in his psoas muscle caused by a perforation in his small intestine.

Right behind my right eye. They lasted 45 minutes. Tear eyes and stuffy nose ensued. This started when I was eleven and happened every year on the dot. I started going to the doctors and I'd get sinus headache diagnosis. Boom took pills for a month and the headaches would be gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So every year I'd wait about a month or two into the headaches I'd go to the doctor and get antibiotics. This went on til I was 19 and I remember the headache that changed me. I was watching a movie at the theatres, and boom i get a headache. This headache was like no other, in less than thirty seconds I was in the most excruciating pain I've experienced. Stabbing behind my right eye. Tears flowing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We leave the theatre and I can't even drive. My head is in my hands not moving at all. So agitated. I just want to sit there and snap at any advances of help by my gf. Her trying to rub my back I can't take. I need to be left alone and not thinking. Thinking hurts. It lasts 80 minutes of me crying and just sitting there physically not able to move or comprehend speech because of the focus on pain you have.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thenext day I'm driving and get one. I go to a new Dr and tell him "I get sinus headaches , can I get this and this and I'll be happy to go" something like that. So him being a good Dr. takes the time to go through my symptoms and correctly diagnoses me with Cluster headaches. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All I can say is, cluster headaches. Im lucky and usually get mild headaches. I've only encountered 4 or 5 crippling headaches that is unimaginable. Some people get a cripplING headache every day at the same time every day. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl2086/" target="_blank"&gt; twitchy_shemale &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/man-feeling-bad-while-sharing-his-thoughts-with-ps-UM7SWGM" target="_blank"&gt; Zinkevych_D/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-54/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472004"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472004" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-21-68e7a9cf5387e__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Woman in a control room speaking on the phone, focused on correcting self-diagnosed medical assumptions." title="Woman in a control room speaking on the phone, focused on correcting self-diagnosed medical assumptions." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;911 calltaker. 9/10 times this is what we get.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the best was "MY BABY CAN'T BREATHE!!!! SHE'S DYING AND GASPING! JUST SEND THEM!" .... then proceeds to hang up before I get an address.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily I was already in the process of narrowing down her cell phone by refreshing the signal a few times (leave GPS turned on people!!) so I was 99% certain I had the right house. I start help out that way while I call her back; no answer. So I call the house number we had in previous calls for that address until I get an answer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When she answers she's perfectly calm and happy asking who it is. When I tell her it's 911 and we got disconnected (no s**t, she hung up), she flips out screaming that I'm wasting time and sends like 10 insults my way. At this point I'm getting tired of it so I tell her there's more than one person here handling her call and we already have paramedics enroute.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point she tries to hang up again saying her baby isn't breathing. So I get forceful (AKA still polite but very direct) saying we need to start CPR, she says no need because they're pouring water over her to make her breathe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wtf? If she's gasping she's going to inhale the water. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She tries to hang up again and I tell her if she doesn't listen to me then I will make sure the sheriff goes out there (they already were, they respond to most child calls with us) for child endangerment because I'm trying to help save the baby correctly. Now "help me help you".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she listens and walks into the room where the baby is screaming loudly. "SEE?! SHE'S NOT BREATHING SHE NEEDS WATER OR SOMETHING!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Again, I've lost all patience. If the child is screaming then they are breathing. If they aren't having difficulty crying then they are breathing fine. This kid was breathing just fine, just angry. I tell her this and she says the magic words:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Lady I'm a CNA, I have no idea what you do but I help people." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Ma'am my training academy to do my job is longer than your CNA training. I don't try to drown people when they cry." And at this point I think I should not have said that...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Luckily the medics made it there by then and she got focused on them. The baby was screaming because they spanked a 3 month old for spitting up.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl6z3n/" target="_blank"&gt; anon &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://elements.envato.com/control-room-telephone-and-calling-with-woman-secu-W2E8Z7V" target="_blank"&gt; YuriArcursPeopleimages/Envato (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-55/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471969"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471969" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;**Tl,dr: I think I'm having eye-strain induced headaches. In reality, the bone marrow in 1/3 of my skull had turned necrotic.**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was the summer of 2008. I was at work with a massive headache. I decided to head home early. Thinking my eyes were acting up again. (I'd suffered from severe light sensitivity since I was 12. This wasn't entirely uncommon.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the lobby of the building I pass out as I'm nodding to the security guard. I wake up in the hospital, the doctor is talking with a nurse insisting I get another set of X-rays "There's no way this is right, have a different tech take another set of images." Then he walks out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm asking what's up. No one is explaining anything. I have another set of X-rays done. A bunch of other Scans of which I still don't understand the differences. And eventually the doctor comes in. Still no one has explained anything to me, no matter how much I ask "Wait for the doctor to get back."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally the doctor comes in and tells me they're going to need to prep me for surgery. I immediately ask about my eyes. He seems confused. "Did no one tell you what's going on?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"...umm..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctor gets all upset "You're missing 1/3 of your skull. Or more appropriately, the bone marrow inside the entire right side of your head is necrotic. It's just sitting there between slivers of bone. When's the last time you've been to the dentist?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"I don't know, 10-15 years ago? I was planning on going next month now that I finally have insurance for the first time."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Well we're not sure how it is you're alive. But this has been building for at least 10 years. An abscess in your gums has burrowed up into your bone."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A week later, after a bunch of specialists are consulted, I had my teeth, gums, soft palette, and entire right side of my skull drained of fluid and removed. I was awake through most of it, and no amount of pain medication was enough to deal through the worst of it. Everything was replaced by mostly a plastic polymer, with some metal studs to snap everything together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edit: My photo-sensitivity issues weren't a related symptom, if you have light sensitivity and get headaches; don't worry. It's normal for photo-sensitive eyes to get headaches in bright light. If you have an abscess though, go to the dentist. No matter how much it costs.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl3au0/" target="_blank"&gt; Melachiah &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-20/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471980"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471980" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/most-incorrect-self-diagnosis-doctors-pactice-13-68e7a2ff7db91__700.jpg?utm_campaign=rebelboost_true" alt="Doctor in blue scrubs with stethoscope, representing medical professionals correcting self-diagnosed health mistakes." title="Doctor in blue scrubs with stethoscope, representing medical professionals correcting self-diagnosed health mistakes." fetchpriority="low"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;I'm not a doctor, but a medical translator.

Pregnancy test comes back negative, meantime we work up the history of her experiencing all the classic symptoms of menopause. Anyways, when we tried to explain to her that it was menopause, a natural physiological response to aging in females, she got extremely upset. Requested for a repeat pregnancy test, which we obliged to. Once again, results came back negative. Tried explaining to the patient once more what menopause was, however she told us we were making things up to put it pleasantly. When asked what she thought was wrong, her explanation, in her words were as follows: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) I am pregnant with baby Jesus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) I need to get a new boyfriend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We tried one last time to explain the situation, however she stormed out and never came back.

It hurt, a lot, and so I asked my wife (a former dental assistant) to check it out. She said it looked like an abscessed tooth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went in to the dentist the next day. Another dental assistant (with years of experience) took a look and said, yeah, sure looked like an abscess to her. Too bad, it's a root canal. She took some x-rays and left. I'm feeling pretty bad about it now. I thought I took decent care of my teeth, so this kind of blind sided me. I started mentally preparing myself for seemingly inevitable root canal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dentist came in. He's normally a pretty funny guy, but this time he was pretty serious. He looks at the X-rays, peers in my mouth for about ten seconds, and then stands up and starts elevating my chair. "Seven to ten days." That's all he said. I'm pretty confused at this point. He laughed at my expression and said, "You have one heck of a canker sore, sir. It'll be gone in 7-10 days. Today's your lucky day."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I've never been so happy to have a canker sore.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl2zob/" target="_blank"&gt; jamon51 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-57/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9472038"&gt;  &lt;p id="9472038" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;I had really bad abdominal pain and I thought I had an appendicitis but turns out I was just crazy constipated.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/37a1oz/doctors_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_incorrect/crl1uiu/" target="_blank"&gt; Anna_rampage &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10588-89/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9471986"&gt;  &lt;p id="9471986" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description"&gt;Not a doctor but a Physio, had an elderly female patient ask if she should go and have her prostate checked because her father passed away because of prostate cancer at her age.

It really depends on who you ask. I’m not talking about potentially risky biodefense lab research, but something that doesn’t yet exist: mirror life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Here’s a refresher on normal biology: the cells in our bodies are composed of the building blocks of life. Nucleotides and sugars make up our DNA, which provides the blueprint for cells and codes for proteins that carry out key biological functions. In all of life, these biomolecules have a specific “handedness.” (Bear with me here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A mirror image is possible, the way your left and right hands are mirror images of each other. But mirror life can’t evolve from existing life in nature. If it eventually emerges, it’s because we’ve created it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;Sign up &lt;a href="/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them.

We listen to the A-side, with genetic material made from right-handed nucleotides and proteins composed of left-handed amino acids. Natural life has evolved to only use this configuration. These biomolecules are &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/origin-chiral-biomolecules"&gt;chiral&lt;/a&gt;: they can’t be superimposed on their mirror images. All life uses the same chirality. The hope, and fear, is that the opposite — synthetic life based on left-handed genes and right-handed proteins — exists on the bonus B-side of the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As &lt;a href="/future-perfect/393048/mirror-life-mirror-bacteria-existential-risk-science-biology-apocalypse"&gt;my former colleague Kelsey Piper explained&lt;/a&gt; back in January, mirror life could represent a whole new way that the world could end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’re at least decades away from being able to create entire mirror cells — that includes bacteria. The technologies that would allow us to do so aren’t yet up to the task. But we’ve &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10628113/"&gt;encountered&lt;/a&gt; mirror biomolecules like right-handed amino acids in nature, and scientists have synthesized mirror enzymes capable of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;reading&lt;/a&gt; mirror genes. With the power of chemistry, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5470636/#:~:text=Proteins%20composed%20entirely%20of%20unnatural,in%20a%20way%20previously%20unattainable."&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; mirror proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These mirror biomolecules are the building blocks of mirror life, but they are not mirror life itself. This distinction is really important, and not only because I’m being pedantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/stoken/author-tokens/ST-2327/full"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;last year &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/dec/12/unprecedented-risk-to-life-on-earth-scientists-call-for-halt-on-mirror-life-microbe-research"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/31/mirror-life-scientists-push-for-ban/85866520007/"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/pause-mirror-life/"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; after its authors laid out potential catastrophic risks of mirror life. Such risks include the possibility that mirror bacteria would evade our immune systems and lack natural predators, replicating to the point that they threaten to outcompete normal life. The authors concluded that “in the absence of compelling evidence for reassurance, our view is that mirror bacteria and other mirror organisms should not be created.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So if those are the risks, then we definitely shouldn’t pursue the creation of mirror life. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, only if we accept that those &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Something that’s gotten a bit lost in the noise of media coverage is that the 35+ authors — who hail from fields as diverse as ecology, immunology, and synthetic biology — want mirror &lt;em&gt;biomolecule&lt;/em&gt; research to continue. Nearly everyone agrees on that, because mirror biomolecules can offer immense benefits for developing new therapeutics, diagnostics, and studying the biochemistry of life without making new life itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-brief-argument-against-mirror-life" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The (brief) argument against mirror life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But first, let’s get into why the idea of mirror life is so frightening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cbs.umn.edu/directory/kate-adamala"&gt;Kate Adamala&lt;/a&gt;, a biochemist building synthetic cells at the University of Minnesota and the lead author of the &lt;em&gt;Science &lt;/em&gt;paper, received a 2019 grant to develop and deploy mirror cells. Upon looking into it further, she decided that the risks far outweighed the benefits, and called for the work to be halted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Mirror molecules are safe to make, because unlike mirror bacteria, the molecules don’t replicate, so they don’t pose any risks of spreading uncontrollably,” Adamala told me over email. One of her chief concerns is that normal cells may be unable to recognize mirror cells, because many of our immune mechanisms are based on chirality, or handedness. This could allow mirror cells to “grow unrestrained by the immune system and environmental predators” that keep normal cells in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;ul class="duet--article--unordered-list _1agbrixi _739u100 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The collapse of entire ecosystems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The inability to develop robust medical countermeasures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="_739u101"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The possibility that mirror bacteria would be completely resistant to predation by other microbes that prey on bacteria and keep their population under control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It’s hard to overstate how severe these risks could be,” Ruslan Medzhitov, an immunologist at Yale University and one of the paper’s co-authors, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/leading-scientists-urge-ban-developing-mirror-image-bacteria"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; Science News. “If mirror bacteria were to spread through infected animals and plants, much of the planet’s many environments could be contaminated. …Any exposure to contaminated dust or soil could be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We could see a mass extinction event, an existential threat to multicellular life as we know it. Effective biocontainment, the researchers argue, would be incredibly difficult. If you have the time, it’s worth reading the 299-page &lt;a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:cv716pj4036/Technical%20Report%20on%20Mirror%20Bacteria%20Feasibility%20and%20Risks.pdf"&gt;technical report&lt;/a&gt; that explains how the study authors came to their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That said, mirror life could offer real benefits. Mirror therapeutics, which wouldn’t be recognized by our digestive enzymes, have the potential to last a lot longer in our bodies, opening up new possibilities for the treatment of chronic disease. Right now, we create mirror therapeutics chemically, putting them together atom by atom. Mirror bacteria could do this for us, and at a much greater speed, &lt;a href="https://attheu.utah.edu/health-medicine/mirror-life/"&gt;allowing&lt;/a&gt; us to produce mirror therapeutics en masse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Synthetic biology and synthetic chemistry are relatively small fields, and mirror biology is even smaller. The declarations of a scientific consensus around mirror life may be premature, but a growing number of voices are getting involved in discussions on the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I want to make it very clear that right now, mirror life is only a possibility. And it might be more distant than we think. &lt;a href="https://www.chem.ubc.ca/david-perrin"&gt;David Perrin&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic chemist at the University of British Columbia, told me over email that science is nowhere close to creating a living mirror cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He is also skeptical that mirror bacteria would be toxic to normal life, and believes our immune systems would likely be able to neutralize them after all. Immune responses are complex, and not all rely on handedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The scale of the threat is unclear, because mirror organisms might be hopelessly outcompeted by regular life. By creating a second tree of life, we might create a second evolutionary arms race, with mirror life on the losing side. Mirror organisms might struggle to find food they need to proliferate. Or not — evolution is a funny thing — but at this point there’s no way to know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The more I think about this, the more I realize that the real concern ought to be with creating life on this side of the mirror,” Perrin told me. Trying to shut down work on creating mirror life “makes no sense. …What would have happened if we put a total moratorium on researching radioactivity? We wouldn’t know anything about RNA. And we wouldn’t have any radioactive treatments for cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;He thinks that red lines can be drawn — when people come closer to actually generating mirror life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/gigi-kwik-gronvall"&gt;Gigi Gronvall&lt;/a&gt;, an immunologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and biosecurity expert at Johns Hopkins University, told Science News that the paper’s concerns were very theoretical. While she strongly supports the authors’ advocacy for discussion around the issue, she thinks that any proposed funding and research ban “puts the cart before the horse” and could impede research leading to surprising scientific advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We don’t fully understand the risks of mirror life, and we won’t without more research. But this research could be purely &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.202500051"&gt;computational&lt;/a&gt;, allowing us to assess the nature of potential threats without posing real biological risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Creating mirror life could help us &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/why-are-all-proteins-left-handed-new-theory-could-solve-origin-of-life-mystery"&gt;understand&lt;/a&gt; the origins of life and why it evolved in the direction that it did. I’d be lying if I didn’t say that the idea of a second tree of life, side B of the biological recording, is really cool. That’s not to say that we shouldn’t be worried about potential risks here. This is completely new territory, and it might not remain the stuff of science fiction forever. But there is a debate to be had, and more evidence may emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And we really do need these discussions. I’m glad that the Mirror Biology Dialogues Fund is &lt;a href="https://www.mbdialogues.org/events"&gt;hosting&lt;/a&gt; events to facilitate them. It’s unusual to have the opportunity to proactively shape biotech governance well before the technology becomes a real possibility. Certainly, there’s more to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQQjM5bGhKeVVtdmdnTlZkSWRhNTZFOFdQOUxadm9ka0dSMzJSOFFLOTZSX0RHQVNxbmVaajVuQ1dGaEtnWFRPV003T2pxTjJzZmRacVl0NW5VcS1HczM1eko5VkNnNjQtcDRxYmE2WmEzb0pUemw5ay0xR1RHU0RvdDVuSmdINXB0S1V1S2RqVEF3OEFXdU9tOC1mVzJYaHc</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.的下一个疫苗目标- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/10/10/rfk-vaccine-aluminum-trump-ban</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:16:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBkSEgyOWpqSXRCUXJ3el9uTGYtckdNamJMVTFQN1NFekttRlZqWmlKdTZ5c0N0SjFDd0FNTWZOYnpEM212bDEtWmt3a3VreVU0d1hCSG1nNDNVY0llNEFZNmcwN2l2X1FKNmw4bVBhb0M</guid></item><item><title>美国各地的麻疹疫情继续增加病例数- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/10/health/measles-outbreaks-utah-arizona-south-carolina</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00043b6nnvd0clai@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been an average of 27 new measles cases reported each week since the end of August, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The annual total – now up to 1,563 cases since January – is the highest by a significant margin since measles was declared eliminated in the US a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk2wqse00003b6qwyafchyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s a &lt;a href="https://newalbanyohio.org/news/2025/10/confirmed-case-of-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;new outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio, a recent &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html" target="_blank"&gt;surge&lt;/a&gt; in cases in Minnesota and more than 150 unvaccinated schoolchildren in South Carolina are in quarantine because of an ongoing outbreak there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00053b6nah7gqtko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before this year, the US had recorded only 10 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coca/media/pdfs/2025/COCA-Call-Slides_09.11.25_Combined-FINALV2.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;large measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; – defined by the CDC as more than 50 related cases – since reaching elimination status in 2000. But an ongoing outbreak along the border between Arizona and Utah is already the third large outbreak this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00063b6nj94nfg7j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been more than 90 confirmed cases related to the outbreak – at least 59 in Arizona and 36 in Utah, according to state health departments – and case counts continue to grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00073b6n46rmcqik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist in Utah, said there is still a lot of opportunity for measles to continue to spread in the area.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00083b6ncg2sv3sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Unfortunately, I think we still have quite a while to go with infections. We know that most of our infections have been localized down towards the southern end of our state, but I think we are starting to see now people get infected even at the very north end of our state,” she said. “So I do think that this is going to continue to bop around and spread in different communities. I suspect we’re in the middle of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt00093b6n10jfaug5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say that any amount of measles spread is cause for concern, and large outbreaks highlight the dangers of declining vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000a3b6nlu1h1mqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have multiple cases happening, particularly with those numbers, it’s only possible because you have susceptible individuals,” said Dr. Scott Harris, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000b3b6n688f1ofb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are measles cases in the US every year, often introduced via international travel, Harris said. But those cases can really multiply only if they’re happening among other people who are unvaccinated – and can multiply at large scale only if large parts of a community are unvaccinated. The Texas outbreak is evidence of this, he said, with state health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that 97% of its cases were among people who had not gotten one or both of the recommended two vaccine doses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000c3b6njfq9do4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The story here is: Parents of young children are skeptical about vaccination,” Harris said. “There are lots of reasons why, but if that weren’t the case, this wouldn’t be a story, because we wouldn’t have these outbreaks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000d3b6nqo077tda@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A record share of US kindergartners had an exemption for a required vaccination in the last school year, and coverage for all reported vaccines – including the measles vaccine – continued on a downward trend, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/31/health/vaccination-school-requirements-cdc"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0lj6q00073b6qkahyoz2b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine dropped to 92.5%, the latest data shows. Because measles is such a highly contagious disease, public health experts say that at least 95% MMR coverage is needed to prevent spread. Last year marks the fifth year in a row that coverage has been below that target.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqhkbe00003b6niazx1wvu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Utah, Nolen says that public health officials have a good grasp on where measles is spreading thanks to wastewater monitoring that can capture virus levels beyond official case counts, and where the risk is elevated due to low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgkqowk600063b6n86q7r31d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In those areas, we try to work with the local health department and the community to get the word out that we know that there is measles in their area and that we really encourage families to consider getting vaccines,” she said. Misinformation has created some vaccine hesitancy, she said, but vaccination rates have ticked up as awareness about the current outbreak has grown.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000e3b6nfk2w2ta5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate ongoing outbreak in South Carolina also threatens to grow quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000f3b6nfvnzppuo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 150 unvaccinated children are in quarantine after measles exposures at two schools in the northern part of the state, one public elementary school and one public charter school in Spartanburg County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000g3b6n9gi39iyb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those schools are following the protocols to exclude these students until the period of potential disease transmission has safely ended,” Dr. Linda Bell, South Carolina’s state epidemiologist, said Thursday. “Those students are identified as having been exposed and not having been vaccinated, and that’s the reason for the exclusion.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000h3b6n7tgrk0ld@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About 90% of people who have been exposed to measles and do not have immune protection from vaccination could get infected, Bell said, and “worst-case scenario” would be that rate of infection among the at-risk students who are being closely monitored for symptoms while in quarantine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000i3b6nm2ilcov6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There have been 11 confirmed measles cases in South Carolina this year, including seven associated with the Spartanburg County outbreak since September 25, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fdiseases-conditions%2Finfectious-diseases%2Fviruses-parasites-bacterial-infections%2Fmeasles-rubeola%2F2025&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682558291%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=SKMKDLZxmtHJsEinaRbgQpFMfnUegLGeorSRI9Uvpgk%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to the state health department&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000j3b6nt177sdu0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Spartanburg County has one of the lowest school vaccination rates in the state, according to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdph.sc.gov%2Fhealth-wellness%2Fchild-teen-health%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-data%2Fschool-vaccination-coverage-and&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ccf54477b5bb445823b7108de076c3305%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638956358682582140%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=qgZ8%2FHacZhsiUkvcIbGmx2FOA4QM%2FSkkgllcqI%2B7dlw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department. Last school year, less than 90% of school students there received their required immunizations, which includes two doses of the MMR vaccine. School vaccination coverage has been falling in Spartanburg County for years, as it has across the state and nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000k3b6nuyecv3fk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A measles case reported Thursday in Greenville County, South Carolina’s most populous county, is being investigated for a possible link to the Spartanburg outbreak. But the state health department is not aware of any other potentially related cases in other states or jurisdictions, Bell said Thursday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000l3b6nb43ydux3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s “incredibly expensive and demanding” for local health departments to respond to measles threats, said Dr. Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The organization has worked with health departments from across the country to help them learn from their experiences responding to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000m3b6n8jblw2io@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health departments are already stretched thin by budget constraints and staff attrition. Adding measles outbreaks to their workload is draining the reserves of even the best-resourced departments,” Rivers said. “It’s been hard to understand from the outside what supports the federal government is offering to local responders.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000n3b6n0l3t04qp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has continued to update its measles tracker during the federal government shutdown, even as other surveillance data systems have come to a halt. And local health leaders say they have continued to stay in contact with CDC experts, although they have been warned that response times may be a bit slower.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000o3b6nf75iv9yj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Due to a lapse in federal funding, CDC has developed an orderly shutdown plan, ensuring critical public health and safety functions continue without interruption. As found in the plan, CDC and [the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry] would collect data being reported by states, hospitals, and others, and report out critical information needed for state and local health authorities and providers to track, prevent and treat diseases,” according to a statement from the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000p3b6nzvf2h6s5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But federal surveillance systems are far from perfect, and experts say that formally reported measles cases in the US are probably a significant undercount, with some estimating that this year’s total could be closer to 5,000 cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000q3b6ndkruzg2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Current measles outbreak trends are “consistent with an undervaccinated population,” said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has exacerbated problems with both disease surveillance and vaccination rates, he said, by cutting federal health agency workers and failing to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/kennedy-measles-texas-doctor-treatment"&gt;fully endorse&lt;/a&gt; the MMR vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000r3b6nvloqs722@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re in the midst of a measles epidemic,” Offit said. “We should have an administration that stands up clearly and definitively and holds press conferences saying, ‘Vaccinate your children. These are preventable illnesses.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk0uubm00003b6qhkfvzpga@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgk077yt000t3b6njojkbq7c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust in federal health leadership has suffered under Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/rfk-approval-cdc-trust-vaccines-kff"&gt;a new poll shows&lt;/a&gt;, with most US adults saying they disapprove of the way he’s handled vaccine policy and his role as health secretary overall.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the journal &lt;i&gt;Childhood in the Past&lt;/i&gt;, Ph.D. candidate Duru Yağmur Başaran &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17585716.2025.2555855" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the results of an analysis of an over 900-year-old skeleton of a child. The study revealed that a 2.5 to 3.5-year-old child had suffered from a rare disease seldom seen in archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Excavated from the archaeological site of Aphrodisias, located in southwestern Türkiye, the remains were recovered in 1985 from the site of Tetrapylon Cemetery, dated to around the 10th–12th century, placing it firmly in the Middle Byzantine period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grave, labeled "Tomb 73A" (S-TET-II-85 Tomb 73A), contained the remains of two non-adults, including children 73A and B. Skeleton 73A exhibited unusual skeletal deformations, including thickening and swelling of various bone elements, including parts of the child's jaw, shoulder blade, and shafts of the left arm bones. The left ulna (lower arm bone) in particular had swollen to nearly double its usual size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the remains revealed the child to be around 3 years old, although there was a discrepancy between the estimated age based on the long bones (1.5–2 years) and the teeth (2.5–3.5 years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to determine what disease could have caused these deformities, several diseases and their characteristics were compared to the skeletal remains of the Aphrodisias child. These illnesses included hemolytic anemias, scurvy, rickets, tuberculosis, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/child+abuse/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;child abuse&lt;/a&gt;, and infantile cortical hyperostosis (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many of these diseases did not quite match the deformities observed on the bones of the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the list of diseases, the Aphrodisias child showed the greatest resemblance to ICH, also known as Caffey disease. This &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/rare+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rare disease&lt;/a&gt; usually develops in early infancy and affects various skeletal elements and surrounding connective tissues. It typically develops around 5 months of age, though it can present itself as early as birth and even in utero. Interestingly, the disease normally also resolves itself around age three, though it may recur in rare cases.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the Aphrodisias child showed early signs of recovery just before its death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease is characterized by asymmetrical thickening of bone caused by the inflammation of the periosteum (the membrane covering bones), which leads to new bone layers being deposited. The disease most commonly affects the jaw, forearm (ulna), shin bone, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/collar+bone/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;collar bone&lt;/a&gt;, shoulder blade, and ribs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible that this disease may have contributed to the discrepancy between the age estimate in the bones and teeth, as bones are more susceptible to environmental stressors such as malnutrition. Such factors are likely to occur, especially in ICH, as it affects the jaw, making it difficult to feed children suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aphrodisias child is one of only a handful of known archaeological ICH cases. In fact, the disease, including its cause and the reasons for resolving itself, remains difficult to diagnose even in modern clinical settings. However, some known symptoms include fever, irritability, thickening of the bones, and swelling of the overlying soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disease seems to develop sporadically and disappear spontaneously, although some familial cases have been reported, indicating there may be some hereditary factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Ph.D. candidate Başaran, it is unclear if the child died from ICH, "Unfortunately, the cause of death cannot be determined in most cases where we only have skeletonized remains. It is possible that the individual passed away from ICH, complications that arose from ICH, or a completely unrelated matter."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case contributes to our understanding of non-adult health in Middle Byzantine Aphrodisias. Additionally, the addition of this case to the record of known ICH cases in archaeology contributes to developing a more refined and &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/reliable+method/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;reliable method&lt;/a&gt; of diagnosing the disease in historic and prehistoric contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Americans say that given the choice, they &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/report-section/views-and-experiences-with-end-of-life-medical-care-in-the-us-findings/#:~:text=As%20other%20research%20has%20shown,nursing%20home%20(1%20percent)." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;would prefer to die at home&lt;/a&gt;, but about &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15090940/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;1 in 5&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the U.S. occur after admission to an intensive care unit. In the book “&lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&amp;amp;u=2986930&amp;amp;m=97137&amp;amp;afftrack=64273215e4b02a8d518e9b1f&amp;amp;urllink=bookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fextreme-measures-finding-a-better-path-to-the-end-of-life%2F9780525533412" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Extreme Measures: Finding a Better Path to the End of Life&lt;/a&gt;,” Dr. Jessica Zitter details what she calls the “end-of-life conveyor belt” — a type of care in which dying ICU patients receive painful treatments to be kept at alive at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, by the time someone is on the conveyor belt, it’s often too late to talk to them about what they want. And then everybody is trying to play catch-up. And it’s hard to get it right when the chips are down and there’s so much emotion,” said Zitter, who specializes in palliative medicine and critical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So my recommendation is to talk about these issues early on in life, maybe starting when you become an adult. Start to think about your mortality, and visualize how you would want things to go for you when you get into that stage of life, the end stage. Communicate honestly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filling out forms for so-called advance care planning goes a long way. But “it’s as important that you, number one, identify a person you trust — or two or three [people] — that can honor your wishes,” Sethi said, “and have the conversations ahead of time, before you’re in the state where you can’t communicate your needs and wishes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some hospice workers recommended &lt;a href="https://www.fivewishes.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Five Wishes&lt;/a&gt;, an advance care planning program, as one way to get clarity on how you want things to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan recommended playing a card game called &lt;a href="https://codaalliance.org/go-wish/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;GoWish&lt;/a&gt; with a friend, a partner or someone else you hope will follow your end-of-life wishes. “[The cards] have different statements on them about possibilities of what you might want or not want,” she said. “And you make stacks of the ones that you like, the ones that you know you don’t care about, and the ones that you’re not sure about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone playing the game may find it difficult to choose which cards represent their values, which is why Morgan suggests having two people play together, so that it can be a conversation starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that there is no one right way to die, and preferences may differ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are people who feel that every moment of life is precious and that they value the length of life over the quality of life,” Eichholz-Heller said. “So they are willing to endure a certain amount of suffering to be able to be kept alive. Then there are other people who value quality of life over length of life. And they would rather focus on comfort, even if it means that they won’t live as long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are still a lot of negative associations with hospice care, even though it can be helpful. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a difference between palliative care and hospice. Palliative care workers help to make patients comfortable at any stage of their life if they’re suffering; hospice is a medical service specifically for people with a short-term life expectancy. While anyone living with a serious illness can seek palliative care, Medicare will help cover hospice care costs for people in the U.S. if their health care provider certifies that they are terminally ill and have &lt;a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/Hospice" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;six months or less&lt;/a&gt; to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people wrongfully assume that going into hospice automatically shortens the life of a patient. Smith said she has been called a murderer for working in hospice care, adding that the worst myth about hospice workers is that they kill their patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People think that when you go on hospice, it’s a death sentence and that death is imminent,” Smith said. She cited former President Jimmy Carter, who &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/former-president-jimmy-carter-enters-hospice-care-charity_n_63f13659e4b0c87f32f1a4f2" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780"&gt;entered&lt;/a&gt; hospice care in February and is still alive today, as one prominent example of how that is not always the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, research shows that seeking palliative care at an early point can improve quality of life. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1000678" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Published&lt;/a&gt; in 2010, one study on advanced lung cancer patients found that offering early palliative care on an outpatient or ambulatory basis led to fewer clinically significant depressive symptoms and a longer median survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When patients are suffering, they use so much of their energy just to fight the suffering that if we can make them comfortable, they sort of stabilize,” Eichholz-Heller said. “And a lot of times, it really helps them to live longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hospices can differ in their approach to care and the additional services they offer. There are resources that can help you figure out &lt;a href="https://americanhospice.org/learning-about-hospice/choosing-a-hospice-16-questions-to-ask/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7955780" data-affiliate="true"&gt;the right questions to ask&lt;/a&gt; to select the best hospice for you or a loved one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can’t control death. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Short bursts of pain act as warning signals that protect us from harm. When you touch a hot pan, stub your toe, or bump your head, your nervous system instantly delivers an “Ow!” that prompts you to pull back before more damage occurs. The pain fades, the body heals, and you remember what not to do next time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chronic pain, however, is an entirely different story. In this condition, the warning signal doesn’t stop even after the injury has healed. For about 50 million people in the United States, pain becomes a constant, invisible companion that can persist for years or even decades. "It's not just an injury that won't heal," explains neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania J. Nicholas Betley, "it's a brain input that's become sensitized and hyperactive, and determining how to quiet that input could lead to better treatments."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betley, along with collaborators from the University of Pittsburgh and Scripps Research Institute, has discovered an important piece of the chronic pain puzzle. Their research points to a specific group of brainstem cells called Y1 receptor (Y1R)-expressing neurons, located in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN). These neurons are activated in persistent pain states, but they also process signals related to hunger, fear, and thirst. This suggests that the brain can adjust pain responses when other, more urgent needs demand attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, indicate that relief may be possible because, as the researchers write, "there are circuits in the brain that can reduce the activity of neurons that transmit the signal of pain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking pain in the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with the Taylor lab at the University of Pittsburgh, Betley’s team used calcium imaging to visualize neuron activity in real time in animal models of both short-term and long-term pain. They observed that Y1R neurons did not simply react to quick bursts of pain; instead, they kept firing steadily during prolonged pain, a phenomenon known as “tonic activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betley compares this to an engine left running even after you’ve parked the car. The pain signals continue to hum in the background even when physical recovery seems complete. This ongoing neural activity may explain why some people continue to feel pain long after an injury or surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research originated from an unexpected observation Betley made after joining Penn in 2015: hunger seemed to lessen chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"From my own experience, I felt that when you're really hungry you'll do almost anything to get food," he says. "When it came to chronic, lingering pain, hunger seemed to be more powerful than Advil at reducing pain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That insight inspired further investigation. Former graduate student Nitsan Goldstein found that other critical survival states—such as thirst and fear—can also suppress long-term pain. In collaboration with the Kennedy lab at Scripps, the team showed that the brain’s parabrachial nucleus can filter sensory input to quiet pain when immediate survival takes priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That told us the brain must have a built-in way of prioritizing urgent survival needs over pain, and we wanted to find the neurons responsible for that switch," says Goldstein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key part of that switch is neuropeptide Y (NPY), a signaling molecule that helps the brain juggle competing needs. When hunger or fear takes priority, NPY acts on Y1 receptors in the parabrachial nucleus to dampen ongoing pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like the brain has this built-in override switch," Goldstein explains. "If you're starving or facing a predator, you can't afford to be overwhelmed by lingering pain. Neurons activated by these other threats release NPY, and NPY quiets the pain signal so that other survival needs take precedence."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A scattered signal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also characterized the molecular and anatomical identity of the Y1R neurons in the lPBN. They found that Y1Rneurons didn't form two tidy anatomical or molecular populations. Instead, these neurons were scattered across many other cell types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like looking at cars in a parking lot," Betley says. "We expected all the Y1R neurons to be a cluster of yellow cars parked together, but here the Y1R neurons are like yellow paint distributed across red cars, blue cars, and green cars. We don't know exactly &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;, but we think this mosaic distribution may allow the brain to dampen different kinds of painful inputs across multiple circuits."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explorations of pain treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What excites Betley with this discovery is the further exploration of its potential to "use Y1 neural activity as a biomarker for chronic pain, something drug developers and clinicians have long lacked," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Right now, patients may go to an orthopedist or a neurologist, and there is no clear injury. But they're still in pain," he says. "What we're showing is that the problem may not be in the nerves at the site of injury, but in the brain circuit itself. If we can target these neurons, that opens up a whole new path for treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research also suggests that behavioral interventions such as exercise, meditation, and cognitive behavioral therapy may influence how these brain circuits fire, just as hunger and fear did in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've shown that this circuit is flexible, it can be dialed up or down," he says. "So, the future isn't &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; about designing a pill. It's also about asking how behavior, training, and lifestyle can change the way these neurons encode pain."&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="subbuzz__number"&gt;9.&lt;/span&gt;
    

    
      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/9357-crohns-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Crohn's disease&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 after over a year of significant pain and major GI problems. I was hospitalized more than once during this year and was referred to a GI doctor in my area. He gave me several reasons for the immense pain I was in: First was that my seat belt probably flung back and hit me, causing a bruise (I didn’t have any bruising). When I told him it was not just pain but that I was also physically sick after eating, he said, 'Well, eat less pizza and drink less beer, and you'll be fine.' It was almost every meal, but sure."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"He referred me for an endoscopy, told me that nothing was wrong, and that sometimes people just have abdominal pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many months of trying to be taken seriously, I switched doctors. With only one test, the new doctor diagnosed me with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease and began a treatment plan that had me in remission within a year. I still manage my Crohn’s with the treatment plan he started a decade ago. When I left that area, I wish I could’ve brought him with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first doctor, though, fully dismissed my pain as the naive ranting of a 'girl' in her 20s. I’ve never felt so belittled by someone who was supposed to be a caregiver."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous, 38, Buffalo, NY&lt;/p&gt;

The clinical characteristics of the cohorts are presented in Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02351-7#MOESM4"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02351-7#MOESM4"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. The first cohort, which served as the training cohort, was obtained from the Yale Cancer Center (New Haven). This cohort comprises 113 tissue samples collected between 2012 and 2019 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02351-7#Fig1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;). Tissue microarray (TMA) master blocks were created using nonadjacent tumor cores, each with a diameter of 0.6 mm, from each patient’s biopsy. To represent tumor heterogeneity, 5 µm-thick cuts from four independent blocks per TMA, each containing a different core (ROI) from the same patient tumor, were used for transcriptomic profiling using the DSP-GeoMx WTA or CTA (cancer transcriptome atlas, Bruker Spatial Biology, US) platforms and single cores were used for proteomic profiling using the PhenoCycler fusion (PCF) platform (Akoya Biosciences, US). The GeoMx WTA platform and two ROIs per TMA from the same patient tumor were used for proteomic profiling using the PCF platform. These samples were collected and used under the authorization of the Yale Human Investigation Committee (protocol 9505008219), with assurances filed with and approved by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Yale cohort TMA is designated as YTMA-471. The second cohort, used as a validation cohort, was obtained from the UQ. TMAs were constructed from resected NSCLC tissue specimens from patients who subsequently recurred and were treated with PD-1-based immunotherapies in the advanced or metastatic setting. This cohort contained 42 tissue samples collected between 2009 and 2018 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02351-7#Fig1"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;) and is designated as UQTMA-4301. The study received ethical approval from the Queensland University of Technology Human Research Ethics Committee (2000000494) and was ratified by the UQ. The third cohort, serving as a second validation dataset, was obtained from Sotiria General Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. It comprised 79 patients who received PD-1-based therapy between 2019 and 2023 and was used to validate the generalizability of the findings from the Yale training cohort. The study was conducted under HIC protocol 16760/23-06-2023. The Greek cohort TMAs are YTMA-642 + YTMA-709. Written informed consent or waiver of consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment.

The training cohort facilitated the development of biomarkers associated with immunotherapy outcomes in machine learning models, while the validation cohorts provided independent data to assess the generalizability of these models. Treatment response was classified according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (Complete Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease and Progressive Disease), and PFS was recorded for all cohorts. To minimize biases from prior therapies, the study focused solely on patients receiving first-line immunotherapy. As a result, the Yale cohort was narrowed down to 41 patients. The clinical endpoint was set to 2-year PFS, consistent with prior real-world and clinical trial data supporting this timeframe as a clinically meaningful surrogate for durable benefit in advanced/metastatic NSCLC. Major immunotherapy trials that led to regulatory approval, such as KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407, implemented a 2-year cap on treatment duration&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Paz-Ares, L.

Segmentation quality was visually inspected, and TMA cores with poor quality, such as those that were fragmented, folded, necrotic, or exhibiting high nonspecific fluorescence, were excluded. An artificial neural network pixel classifier was trained on PanCK (pan-cytokeratin) signals to define a tumor/stroma mask, capturing PanCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; pixels as tumor.

Briefly, four different ROI containing distinct tumor areas of the same tumors were used to enhance reproducibility. Antigen retrieval of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was conducted for 20 min, followed by deparaffinization and rehydration. The slides were then exposed to proteinase K for 20 min, after which RNA probes were applied to the tissues for in situ hybridization. The following day, stringent washes were performed to remove off-target probes. To delineate areas within each ROI, morphology markers were used for each AOI—CD68 for macrophage, CD45 for leukocyte, PanCK for tumor compartments and SYTO 13 for nuclear staining. The slides were incubated, washed and loaded onto the DSP-GeoMx instrument. Scanning, AOI selection and probe collection were performed as per the user manual (MAN-10088-03). Each AOI representing a compartment, such as tumor region, macrophage region or leukocyte region from a patient tumor core was collected in a 96-well plate. Next, a GeoMx-next-generation sequencing (NGS) readout library was prepared according to the user manual (MAN-10117-01). Sequencing was performed by Yale Center for Genome Analysis, and the sequencing data were processed with the GeoMx-NGS Pipeline (MAN-10153-01), converting FASTQ files to digital count conversion (.dcc) files for read counts. Quality control was conducted on each ROI to ensure accurate analysis of the approximately 18,000 genes targeted using the WTA panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec23"&gt;DSP-GeoMx CTA processing for the UQ NSCLC cohort&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the UQ cohort, pretreatment TMA slides were processed using the DSP-GeoMx CTA manual slide preparation protocol.

After antigen retrieval and deparaffinization, proteinase K treatment was performed, followed by in situ hybridization using CTA RNA probes. The stringent washes were then performed to remove off-target probes. CD3, CD68 and PanCK morphology markers were used to identify tumor AOIs (PanCK&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and stromal (PanCK&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) regions. The slides were loaded onto the DSP-GeoMx instrument, and scanning, AOI selection, and probe collection were conducted per the DSP-GeoMx user manual. Each AOI representing a compartment, tumor or stroma, was collected into a 96-well plate. A GeoMx-NGS readout library was prepared following the DSP-GeoMx user manual (MAN-10117-01). PCR reactions were pooled into two mixtures for the tumor and stromal compartments. Sequencing was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility, and data were processed using the GeoMx-NGS Pipeline (MAN-10153-01) to convert FASTQ files to digital counts conversion (.dcc) files for read counts. Quality control was performed according to preset thresholds to ensure accurate and high-quality profiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec24"&gt;Univariable analysis of cell-type fractions associated with treatment outcome&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted univariable analysis to assess the association between cell-type fractions and treatment outcomes for 14 cell types in both tumor and stromal compartments. Cell fractions were derived using the PCF platform. HRs and two-sided log-rank test &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the impact of each cell type on 2-year PFS.

The input consists of matrices &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{tumor}}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{stroma}}\)&lt;/span&gt; containing cell fractions for each patient &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and cell-type &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; in tumor and stroma compartments, respectively, where there are 14 distinct cell types across tumor and stromal compartments. For each patient, we have PFS data (time in months and an event indicator: 1 = progression/death and 0 = alive/progression free). For each compartment, we generated &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; splits of the training data into tenfolds, generating &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; LASSO-penalized Cox models. For each split, tenfold cross-validation was used to select penalty parameter &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;, and a LASSO model was trained using the optimal penalty for that split by pooling all tenfolds. We set lower.limits = 0 in R glmnet (version 4.1-9) for resistance models (positive nonzero coefficients) and upper.limits = 0 for response models (negative nonzero coefficients). This yielded &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; coefficient sets &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{m,j}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{m,j}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the coefficient of cell type &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; in model &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;. Cell types with a nonzero coefficient in at least &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; of the models were retained. A final unpenalized Cox model was fit using these selected cell types to obtain coefficients &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}\)&lt;/span&gt;. The final signature score for patient &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; was calculated as &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({S}_{i}^{\mathrm{final}}={\Sigma }_{j}{\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}{M}_{{ij}}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Hence, the final signature is a Cox regression model trained on LASSO-selected cell types. This pipeline was applied to both tumor and stromal compartments to derive resistance and response signatures, where we set &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 50 for stroma and &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; = 100 for tumor, since we observed that these values were sufficient to identify a stable set of nonzero predictors for each compartment, and the threshold &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; was set to the maximum value such that each signature contained at least three cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec26"&gt;Independent validation of compartment-specific cell-type signatures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We computed the final signature scores for resistance and response models in both tumor and stromal compartments. Each patient received a final score, indicating their predicted risk of progression based on the specific compartment and cell-type signature. We assessed out-of-sample accuracy by evaluating HR and survival probabilities in the validation cohorts. In resistance models, positive coefficients predicted increased risk &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\mathrm{HR} &amp;gt; 1.0\)&lt;/span&gt;; in response models, negative coefficients predicted reduced risk &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\mathrm{HR} &amp;lt; 1.0\)&lt;/span&gt;. Statistical significance of HRs was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were calculated using a two-tailed log-rank test by binarizing the scores at the median and refitting Cox models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec27"&gt;Cell-type deconvolution using DSP-GeoMx- data for validation of spatial proteomic data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the proteomically identified cell types, we analyzed gene expression data generated from the stromal compartment using the DSP software (version 0.4). The quantile-normalized matrix was deconvolved with CIBERSORTx, using the leukocyte gene signature matrix (LM22), which defines reference gene expression profiles for 22 immune cell types. This enabled estimation of stromal cell fractions for each patient. The deconvolution model solved for the cell fractions &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({F}_{{ji}}\)&lt;/span&gt; using: &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(B\times {F}_{i}\approx {M}_{i}^{\mathrm{DSPGeoMx}}\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is the LM22 signature matrix, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({F}_{{ji}}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the fraction of cells belonging to cell type &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; in patient &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({M}_{i}^{\mathrm{DSPGeoMx}}\)&lt;/span&gt; is the stromal compartment matrix for patient &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. We compared cell fraction distributions between patients with different PFS outcomes (alive versus dead) using two-sided &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; tests. This analysis identified stromal cell types enriched in either group. By cross-validating our compartment-specific signatures against DSP-derived CIBERSORTx results, we confirmed the consistency and predictive relevance of the spatial proteomic cell-type features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec28"&gt;Computational pipeline for the development of gene signatures from cell-type signatures (cell-to-gene signatures)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed compartment-specific gene signatures based on the proteomics-derived cell-type signatures using a robust signature training framework based on the approach developed in a prior study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 5" title="Aung, T.

Marker genes were identified using differential expression and a ranked product permutation test with default parameters. We constructed matrices &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{tumor}}\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({M}_{{ij}}^{\,\mathrm{stroma}}\)&lt;/span&gt; containing gene expression counts for each patient &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; and gene &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; in tumor and stroma compartments, respectively, where genes were restricted to those associated with cell types occurring in the associated proteomics cell-type signatures. Each patient had PFS data (time in months and event indicator—1 = progression/death, 0 = progression free). For each compartment (tumor and stroma) and each cell-type gene set, we generated 50 data splits, each split 80/20 for training/testing. In each training split, differentially expressed genes between progression-free and nonprogression-free patients (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, negative binomial exact test) were identified. For each split, 100 LASSO Cox regression models were optimized with different random seeds, by first using tenfold cross-validation on the current training split to select the penalty &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt;, and then fitting a final LASSO Cox regression model with the best value of &lt;i&gt;λ&lt;/i&gt; using the current training set. Any gene appearing in at least one of these models was retained; a signature for the current data split was then trained by fitting an unpenalized Cox regression model on the current training split restricted to the selected genes, and the HR of the signature was estimated on the current test set. To constrain coefficient directions, we set lower.limits = 0 for resistance models (positive nonzero coefficients) and upper.limits = 0 for response models (negative nonzero coefficients). Each data split &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; thus produced a coefficient set &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{m,j}\)&lt;/span&gt; and an associated HR estimate. Genes with nonzero coefficients in at least 0.05 of the models having &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\mathrm{HR} &amp;gt; 1.5\)&lt;/span&gt; (resistance) or &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\mathrm{HR} &amp;lt; 0.7\)&lt;/span&gt; (response) were selected for inclusion in the final signatures. These thresholds were set so that the number of genes included was at most ten. Final Cox regression models were then refit without the penalty using the entire discovery cohort (not split into train/test), and only the selected genes, to derive the final signature coefficients, &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}\)&lt;/span&gt;. The final signature score for patient &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt; was calculated as &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\({S}_{i}^{\mathrm{final}}={\Sigma }_{j}{\beta }_{j}^{\mathrm{final}}{M}_{{ij}}\)&lt;/span&gt;. For training the resistance gene model, we used genes from cell types in the resistance cell-type signature models (for example, proliferating tumor, granulocytes and vessels), and for training the response gene model, we used genes from the cell types in the response cell-type signature models (for example, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages and CD4 T cells). This approach was applied uniformly across tumor and stromal compartments to define gene-level resistance and response signatures derived from cell-type-level proteomic signatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec29"&gt;Independent validation of cell-to-gene signatures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the gene signatures, we calculated gene expression matrices for tumor and stromal compartments in both the UQ cohort and the Greek cohort. Sequencing and data processing for the UQ cohort were performed by the UQ research team. For the Greek cohort, sequencing and data preprocessing were conducted by the Yale team. Each matrix contained expression counts per patient and gene in the respective compartments. We computed final resistance and response signature scores for both tumor and stromal compartments, with each score indicating the predicted risk of progression. Out-of-sample performance was evaluated using HRs of the signature scores evaluated in the validation cohorts. Genes with positive coefficients in the resistance signature predicted increased risk &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\mathrm{HR} &amp;gt; 1.0\)&lt;/span&gt;, while genes with negative coefficients in the response signature predicted reduced risk &lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;\(\mathrm{HR} &amp;lt; 1.0\)&lt;/span&gt;. Statistical significance was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, with two-sided log-rank test &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values derived from each model to test the out-of-sample accuracy of our signatures. We also conducted a multivariable analysis adjusting for clinical factors when available (age, sex, disease stage, prior treatment, type of immunotherapy, line of immunotherapy, histology and smoking status). Cox multivariable regression and Chi-square tests (Supplementary Tables &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02351-7#MOESM4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;–&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41588-025-02351-7#MOESM4"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;) were used to evaluate associations between gene signatures and outcomes.

But experts say it's not quite that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Jenna Macciochi, in otherwise healthy people, taking vitamin C won't stop you from catching a cold—though it may still help once you have one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Consistent Vitamin C intake can slightly reduce the duration and severity if you do catch one,' she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitian Dr Ruxton swears by a daily glass of orange juice to support long-term immunity. Research shows that people who meet their recommended daily intake of vitamin C recover from colds around eight per cent faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One small glass of 100 per cent orange juice provides more than 80 per cent of your daily recommended intake,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts generally agree we should aim for at least 200mg of vitamin C a day for optimal immune function. Yet the average Brit only consumes around 70 to 80mg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other good sources include kiwis, red peppers, berries, grapefruit and leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to Dr Ruxton, vitamin A is essential for making natural killer cells and neutrophils which seek and kill invading bacteria &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Macciochi advises saving vitamin C supplements for when your immune system really needs the extra help—for instance, when you're actually unwell. This is because fighting an infection increases the body's demand for vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ruxton adds: 'If you have a cold, take a high-dose vitamin C supplement of 500 to 1,000mg daily, for about a week.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;A pot of yoghurt to give your system boost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two nutrients that often get overlooked when it comes to immunity are vitamins D and A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Daniel Davis, an immunologist at Imperial College London, explains: 'Vitamin A is vital for the development and functioning of many immune cells, and is crucial to our defences, playing a role in the body's production of mucus, which helps eject germs during respiratory infections—like a runny nose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While vitamin A deficiency is rare in the UK, Dr Jenna Macciochi says eating a variety of fermented foods such as yoghurt, cheese, kefir and kimchi can help strengthen the gut—where around 70 per cent of the immune system resides—and in turn, reduce the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study from Stanford School of Medicine found that people who added fermented foods to their diet for just ten weeks had a wider variety of microbes in their gut and calmer immune cells, meaning less inflammation in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said this suggests fermented foods have an immune-boosting effect, helping to curb unwanted inflammation and support the body's ability to fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oily fish are naturally rich in vitamin D, though more than 1 in 5 Brits are clinically deficient in the so-called sunshine vitamin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, men need around 700mcg of vitamin A a day and women 600mcg—with a single serving of full-fat yoghurt providing roughly 250mcg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Macciochi adds that even small daily habits can make a difference: 'A pot of yoghurt or a little fermented food each day can help maintain a balanced gut microbiome, which is the foundation of a resilient immune system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So while yoghurt might not stop you catching a cold altogether, it could help your body bounce back faster—and keep your defences in better shape through the winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Oily fish to help you beat the bugs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D is another often-overlooked nutrient when it comes to fighting off winter colds—despite multiple studies showing an 'indisputable link' between the so-called sunshine vitamin and the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jenna Macciochi recommends following NHS guidance and taking a daily supplement throughout autumn and winter—meaning everyone should already have started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carrie Ruxton explains why the vitamin is so vital: 'Vitamin D boosts the immune system's defences by stimulating antibacterial proteins and directing the foot soldiers of the immune system—the T cells.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A lack of vitamin D can also raise the risk of respiratory infections. With nearly a third of Britons deficient during the colder months, Dr Ruxton advises eating more oily fish—such as salmon, mackerel and sardines—to help keep levels up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Oysters are one of the richest dietary sources of zinc, which helps support the natural immunity we are born with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: 'Even people who get outdoors regularly struggle to make enough vitamin D from sunlight in the UK during winter, so a daily supplement and vitamin D-rich foods are really important.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other sources include eggs, fortified cereals and dairy products. But oily fish remains the best natural option—with a single portion of salmon providing more than half your daily requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Macciochi adds that maintaining steady vitamin D levels year-round can make a measurable difference: 'People who are deficient are more prone to infections and take longer to recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Keeping levels topped up helps keep your immune system responsive when you need it most.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large health-ccox"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Oysters help keep your defences strong &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As one of the richest dietary sources of zinc, oysters can help build immunity and stave off a winter cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zinc helps support the immune system by producing immune cells in response to exposure to new infections. The essential mineral also helps support innate immunity—the natural immunity we are born with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other good sources of zinc include seafood, poultry, red meat, legumes, nuts, seeds and eggs. But sometimes, our bodies need an added boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'It's a complete myth that lean, red meat is an unhealthy food,' says Dr Ruxton &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies show that a boost of zinc can help ward off cold symptoms, so take a zinc or multimineral supplement for a couple of weeks if you get the sniffles,' Dr Ruxton advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Department of Agriculture, just 100g of raw oysters contains an impressive 16.6mg of zinc, almost the daily recommended amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even a slight shortfall in zinc can make it harder for the body to fend off viruses, particularly during the winter months when our immune systems are under strain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ensuring steady intake through food—or short-term supplements when you're run down—can help keep your defences in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large mol-style-bold health-ccox"&gt;Put lean red meat on your winter menu &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's a complete myth that lean, red meat is an unhealthy food—in fact it's rich in protein, B vitamins, iron and zinc—all of which help support the immune system,' Dr Ruxton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In particular, iron helps regulate the immune system, especially in the intestine, and is essential in making red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But one in ten women are clinically deficient in the nutrient, leading to problems with immunity, brain fog and fatigue—which can make it harder to resist and fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rhiannon Lambert is a Harley Street nutritionist and author of The Science of Nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other great sources of iron include beans such as red kidney beans, edamame beans and chickpeas, nuts, dried fruit, eggs and fortified breakfast cereals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Including a mix of these foods helps ensure you're getting both types of iron — the easily absorbed form from meat and the plant-based version, which is better absorbed when eaten with vitamin C-rich foods such as fruit or vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Getting enough iron year-round not only supports energy and concentration, but also helps your immune system stay resilient when seasonal bugs strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-large mol-style-bold health-ccox"&gt;Should you really feed a cold and starve a fever?  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst the saying goes 'feed a cold and starve a fever', carrying a few extra pounds can actually increase the risk of infection, Prof Davis explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because excess fat can trigger inflammation in immune cells, which in turn increases the risk of disease, such as arthritis and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To make matters worse, fat cells also produce cytokines which contribute to background inflammation in the body, dampening the immune system's sensitivity to real threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Prof Davis warns, being underweight can be just as harmful to our immune systems because not eating enough food can lead to all sorts of nutrient deficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rhiannon Lambert, a leading nutritionist and author of Learn How to Eat Well for Health and Happiness, added: 'The reality is, whether you've got a cold, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-43dd56c0-a4f4-11f0-a860-1fc9539884c9"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; or fever, your immune system needs energy and nutrients to do its job, so eating and getting enough fluids has never been so important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even if you don't have much of an appetite, you need energy to fight whatever it is that's against you. You don't have to eat as much as usual, but it's important to choose nutritious foods to help your body function as optimally as possible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It can be so hard to get your head around the fact that biological pregnancy is not going to work. But as someone going through IVF myself, let me say: the LW has not been paying attention to the details if she thinks having sex with Manny one time is going to solve her problems.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="41" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32k002n3b6imtpfpy0k@published"&gt;Did the doctor definitively say that the reason conception has failed is her husband’s sperm? Does she know with certainty that she has numerous viable eggs that can fertilize unassisted? Does she know that her ovulation cycle is predictable and healthy?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002o3b6iavnh5p9c@published"&gt;The LW was likely told that the probability of natural pregnancy per menstrual cycle is around&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/11585-conception"&gt; 25 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s if she’s in her 20s and there are no other health impediments for her or her husband. This probability&lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/having-a-baby-after-age-35-how-aging-affects-fertility-and-pregnancy"&gt; drops precipitously&lt;/a&gt; with age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002p3b6iio2t5ufx@published"&gt;This is not to discourage people who are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/09/rapamycin-fertility-ovarian-reserve-menopause-antiaging-skepticism.html"&gt;trying to conceive&lt;/a&gt;—I’m in that precipitously dropping probability group, and &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/08/fertility-cliff-advanced-maternal-age-outdated.html"&gt;thank goodness for modern medicine&lt;/a&gt;! But it is noticeable to me that she has gone through IVF and not had a successful pregnancy, so she has been educated on the small probabilities we’re dealing with, and the likelihood that even with the best medicine has to offer, it’s not going to happen. And she and her husband are still thinking there might be a good reason to try this plan, which has seemingly &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/01/mychart-patient-portal-fertility-journey-pregnancy-anxiety.html"&gt;infinite ways&lt;/a&gt; it can go wrong … and only one minuscule way it can go right?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgidq32l002q3b6idqprkep7@published"&gt;That either means there’s more going on here—as you suggested, maybe she or her husband is looking for an excuse for her to have sex with Manny. In that case, DO NOT get a child involved. But more worrying to me is the likelihood that she, her husband, or both have not really understood and processed the IVF failure. There is almost no reason to think she will get pregnant naturally from sleeping with Manny once. The fact that she or her husband think it’s that easy, despite everything they have already learned and experienced, means they need to spend time working through the disappointment and grief that come with accepting that biological children are not in their future. The effort to process, grieve, heal, and move forward as a family should be the focus—not cockamamie schemes that may only damage the marriage more and simply delay the pain of infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

And you make a good point about the fact that they’ve already tried IVF. Sperm quality is definitely something they check out during that process, so the couple should really know definitively, beyond “it looks as though the doctors [who predicted that he wouldn’t be able to conceive when he was a child] were correct.” We have updated information! Anyway, I don’t want to get too far into the medical details, even though those of us who’ve been throughIVF should really have some kind of honorary degree in fertility medicine. Suffice it to say, the answer to “Could this really be the solution we’ve been looking for?” is “probably not.”&lt;/p&gt;

Certainly, romantic love can be important to some, but I only have one person in my life who loves me that way (my husband) and a dozen or more people who love me in a friendship way. I wonder if seeking out a chosen family might help fill this void. Perhaps you could start with fellow adoptees. There’s a lot of discussion about adopted children who went through exactly what you’ve experienced and I bet you would vibe with some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

No detail is too small. Take your time—spend a week or more on it. When you can’t think of one more thing, go through the list and pick out the 10 or 12 most important items. Again, take your time and consider carefully. Once you have locked that down, order the list. Put the most important first, and write them out from first to last. Read it often. If you go out to a bar, read the list before you go. If you go on a weekend singles adventure, make it your purpose to open your heart and get to know everyone.

But perhaps you could also remind the LW that her mother is a fully formed adult who still has desires and needs. No one wants to think of their parents as sexual beings (eww), but the LW seemed to give her dad a pass for his behavior while sort of condemning her mom for her new boobs. There is nothing wrong with wanting to feel attractive at any age, and it’s not necessarily a sign of dementia. The LW should give some grace to her mom—and stay out of it with her sisters.&lt;/p&gt;

The one thing that really bothers me is that she’s jealous of people in our field who are successful. Anytime someone we know, or a random person that has a similar age to us, is remotely successful, she gets jealous. She’ll say things like “why isn’t that me” or just “ugh” and sigh. It’s making me more and more annoyed as time goes on and I notice it more. Of course, I also worry that she will direct that at me and I don’t need that in my life. I’ve been hesitant to tell her when I get job interviews or offers because I don’t know if she’s honest in her “congratulations!” &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/ratted-out-custodian-stealing-food-coworkers-hate-me-dear-prudence-advice.html"&gt;What do I do? &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On average, individuals consume between 39,000 and 52,000 particles annually, with bottled water drinkers taking in an additional 90,000 microplastic fragments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And whilst the European Food Safety Agency maintains that most microplastics are excreted by the body, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation have warned that some particles could enter the bloodstream and lodge in vital organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of evidence has linked them to neurotoxicity, chronic inflammation and disruption of hormones and metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15169729/dangerous-chemicals-bottled-water-bowel-cancer-microplastics.html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, led by Sara Sajedi, a leading environmental management expert at Concordia University, found that people who regularly drink bottled water—consumed before its expiration date—consume around 900,000 more microplastic particles each year than those who drink tap water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sajedi described the health risks posed by single-use plastic bottles as 'serious', and called for greater awareness of what she described as a 'pressing issue.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Microplastics can also contribute to intestinal dysbiosis, disrupt the balance of gut bacteria, and may lead to respiratory diseases when inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These wide-ranging chronic health risks highlight the importance of recognising and addressing the impact of nano- and microplastics to safeguard human health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are also concerned that drinking bottled water after its best-before-date has passed could make it unpalatable, as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) particles break down over time, affecting the taste and smell of the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, PET particles are not thought to contain chemicals that are harmful to our health, like phthalates or BPA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say you can cut your exposure to microplastics by swapping out plastics in your home for natural materials, metal and glass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But if plastic bottles are stored in hot environments, exposed to sunlight or stored beside strong smelling chemicals, the quality of the plastic may degrade more quickly and taint the water inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PET plastics are also breathable, meaning that overtime small amounts of water can evaporate out of the bottle—making room for contaminated particles to enter the source directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15167137/Microplastics-risk-bowel-cancer-depression-human-study.html"&gt;shocking research earlier this week suggested microplastics used in food packaging may be damaging the gut&lt;/a&gt;—raising the risk of bowel cancer and depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery was made by Australian researchers who examined stool samples from healthy volunteers and found that microplastic particles could alter microbial activity in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the changes mirrored patterns previously linked to depression and bowel cancer, suggesting the tiny fragments may disrupt the body's internal balance in ways that affect both physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts called the findings 'significant', saying it was the first human study to show microplastics can alter the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
