The findings need to be confirmed with additional research, and the vast majority of people in the United States are already &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/12/vitamin-d-supplement-deficiency-covid/"&gt;getting enough vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; from diet and sunlight, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RVX4X7J6YZELDOYNPF5X32IPJU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the new analysis, researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and other universities looked at telomeres — the protective caps of DNA code at the ends of chromosomes — which tend to shorten as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3GERJYXPHRGOVBHJJI766IVKG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s a biological “clock” of sorts, and shorter telomeres have been linked to an increased risk of certain diseases. Vitamin D supplements, though, may slow that shrinking process, the new research, published in the &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00255-2/fulltext"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7BH5A5GKNVAT7CIJ3GD2LJ6DAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While previous studies have shown an association between vitamin D and telomere length, most were observational. The new study is randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled, lending more credence to the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2FYDWFMALBHYDBXZOIVVHNT6LU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We think these findings are promising and warrant further study. But we think that the replication will be important before changing the general guidelines for vitamin D intake,” said &lt;a href="https://prevmed.bwh.harvard.edu/joann-e-manson-md-dph/"&gt;JoAnn Manson&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of the study and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="KCQ4AQLVGNDYVKQFCE344AWD2Y" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="KCQ4AQLVGNDYVKQFCE344AWD2Y" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Reduced telomere shortening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RREKZQAQXFGZ3LK4VFEQC75V7U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings are part of a larger study, called the VITAL trial, that Manson and other researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, have been conducting for five years. It involves 25,871 participants — U.S. women age 55 and older and men age 50 and older — who have been given 2,000 IUs of vitamin D3 a day and 1 gram of Omega 3 fatty acid a day to determine their effects primarily on cancer and cardiovascular disease prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUSRLXLG4FHQNG2JHP2QRWV3V4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The telomere study focused on about 900 of those participants, largely from Boston, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and again in years 2 and 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JYQUW5W3BVDMPJX6IDZNJTDEOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers found that compared with the group taking the placebo, those taking vitamin D supplements had reduced telomere shortening over four years. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation, on the other hand, had no obvious effect on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="S4VHXBMF2VDTNEDXL3KBJ4YNRA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="S4VHXBMF2VDTNEDXL3KBJ4YNRA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How telomeres may be associated with aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ISVJKZN2M5DU5H3ZC35TR24YMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;During each cell division, telomeres ensure that the cell’s chromosomes do not fuse with one another or rearrange themselves, and with each replication, the telomeres shorten a bit. This process is associated with aging as well as an increased risk of infections, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXSVZOCGP5DYPJJTRKBJSX32EU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers think that vitamin D supplementation’s benefit is related to tamping down inflammation, Manson said. Inflammation has been associated with autoimmune diseases as well as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="ZX73D7LDNFHKVGMWNMTY4JNXLU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="ZX73D7LDNFHKVGMWNMTY4JNXLU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Healthy diet and lifestyle are critical&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UQQQGUHTMZFDXDBB3DADTJ72TM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While vitamin D may have benefits, Manson emphasized that it is not a cure-all. There are many chronic diseases that do not seem to be reduced by vitamin D supplementation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7265VQYKSZBCDH44R3MODZUKXI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Dietary supplements will never be a substitute for healthy diet and healthy lifestyle, and we've made it very clear time and again that the focus should be on the diet and lifestyle rather than on supplementation,” she said. “However, targeted supplementation for people who have higher levels of inflammation or a higher risk of chronic diseases clearly related to inflammation, those high risk groups may benefit from targeted vitamin D supplementation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C2Y6A47X7ZD73AEPKLG5LZXGTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The telomere study was randomized, meaning participants were randomly assigned to either the vitamin D supplement group or the placebo group to ensure that characteristics such as age, health status, diet and lifestyle are balanced between the groups. Randomization is considered the gold standard in clinical research because it makes the groups as similar as possible at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E26MIEAO6JDLBM5PUXMVD5JEUA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“All of the risk factors for chronic disease, for telomere shortening, the age, the demographics, the physical activity, diet, underlying health, hypertension, diabetes, all these risk factors are balanced out by the randomization process,” Manson said, meaning the only difference between the two groups was that one received vitamin D and one did not. And the study was also “double-blinded,” meaning that not only did the participants in each group not know which was receiving the supplement, but neither did the technicians administering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="NRK27DIADJEEVH3YNQRLR36APU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="NRK27DIADJEEVH3YNQRLR36APU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What other research and experts say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DWHE56MJ55HGZOMMY6ZCWJPJBU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not all studies have been as promising with regard to telomere preservation. A paper published in 2023 in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging, for instance, concluded that “routinely supplementing older adults, who are largely vitamin D replete, with monthly doses of vitamin D is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1279770723002312"&gt;unlikely to influence telomere length&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NLOM6FBBRNFEVEUGQWOT2LKTXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Between 2014 and 2020, researchers at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, Australia, led a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 1,519 participants, to see whether vitamin D supplementation would affect telomere length. They gave the supplement monthly to half of the participants and found no difference between those who received it and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DP67S2RPWBBMHAF36OI4B62CCM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.greiderlab.org/people/index.html"&gt;Carol Greider&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz who won the 2009 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for her discovery of telomerase, an enzyme that protects telomeres from shortening, said in an email that she was skeptical of the new study’s findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="53Z7YL5UBJFF7JOMQE6CP2S5W4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, an assay that was used in the recent study to measure telomere length, has been shown in a number of publications to be unreliable, Greider wrote. The clinical standard for measuring telomere length is a technique called Flow FISH, which is highly reproducible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQUXXRAAUJHTVOS2Z52BA3EZMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Greider also noted that different subtypes of blood cells have different telomere lengths, so any changes in the cell type distribution in the blood could raise or lower the blood’s average telomere length, not because the length changed but because the types of cells present changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GDRCK4CERJBVTFQ52RJHMX3W74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;She cited a&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70030"&gt; perspective published in Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt; in March, in which the authors question research from 2024 that suggested spaceflight, like the Inspiration4 mission, which lasted just three days, increased the average telomere length of the white blood cells of those on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="27IELRT4MVAQ3MCB6V22HLUJNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It’s not that the telomeres are longer, the authors of the Aging Cell article wrote; it’s that the composition of their white blood cells changed, raising the average telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7VHOXREM6RBCTFTJGYBUFAIDLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“So while there may or may not be an effect of Vitamin D on telomeres, the methods used in this study are unlikely to be able to accurately document those changes without any control for cell type distributions,” Greider wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 20:23:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNS3dReThmRFBEcTRvelhTZ0tGNUowT0lxdHE3SUdCM2VBWEV2b2JETjFHVzcxMnpoMFlvRlR6b2ZMNHRXSkVsQlhnNzB6QTZ0UkNwZnVULTZ3Y0hDaWJrd01jYmdOTkYzaHdzblZ0S2FXdHQ5QlU3SnlWTTJuTkJhWmtabnl2djI3eXc</guid></item><item><title>这位115岁的世界上最年长的女性每天都过着这样的生活--印度时报 | One rule the 115-year-old world’s oldest woman lives by every day - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6wFBVV95cUxOY3UxSmNlWDlzTkZfVGtoUFg2enJSelNtVjN4UlJJaW5GY3hRUEk1S1VxSDRSTXlna3RnbE0wRXVtWFp4RklFUTAzVEg4Mnlfa1g4a04xUVA3UnV2djZpVmlIVXBEa2o5dkxVVGtFLTBmQnpYREFUWWZIQmFSdFpDMUlQc1JrdFpORU01elZuV1lUUGdaNEd6RXdmQ3k2NlkxXy03S25NUDNxTl9aWDhHTWVHRFVHbGFpZkZpVDhFRGZodG9XeWVVQk1lZzhITTd4WTZWaXhOZGtVT2pmTlloRXlyaTRjazVocHpz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where everyone searches for the secret to living a long and fulfilling life, the wisdom of those who have actually achieved extraordinary longevity is invaluable. Ethel Caterham, the world’s oldest living woman at the age of 115, offers a simple yet powerful insight into how she has managed to live such a remarkable life.Born in 1909, Ethel has witnessed immense global changes—from world wars to technological revolutions—and through it all, she has maintained a philosophy that has kept her peaceful, healthy, and vibrant. Her secret? One straightforward rule that she believes has helped her live over a century: “Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.” This rule, rooted in calmness and self-respect, reveals much about the connection between emotional well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One rule the 115-year-old world’s oldest woman lives by every day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about her secret to living beyond a century, Ethel’s answer was refreshingly simple: avoiding arguments and listening more. She said, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;“Never argue with anyone. I listen and I do what I like.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This philosophy centers on emotional calmness and self-control, avoiding unnecessary conflicts that can drain energy and increase stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientific research confirms the wisdom in Ethel’s words. Chronic stress and emotional turmoil are linked to an increased risk of heart disease, weakened immune function, and accelerated aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By choosing to avoid arguments, Ethel likely protected her body and mind from these harmful effects, creating an environment where health and happiness could flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ethel Caterham’s early life and formative experiences&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel Caterham was born on August 21, 1909, in the village of Shipton Bellinger, England. Growing up as the second youngest in a family of eight siblings, her early years were shaped by simplicity and traditional values. Life at that time was markedly different — horse-drawn carriages, handwritten letters, and a world on the brink of World War I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the many historical upheavals she experienced, Ethel maintained a steady and calm disposition throughout her life. This ability to remain composed and adaptable was a foundation that supported her health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How emotional well-being impacts longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional health is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in overall longevity. Studies show that people who manage their emotions well and maintain stable, positive relationships tend to live longer and healthier lives. Chronic emotional conflict can lead to inflammation in the body, which is associated with many age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s ability to listen and remain composed reflects an emotional resilience that scientific studies link to longevity. By conserving her energy for positive experiences rather than arguments, she helped her body maintain a healthier internal balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A life rich with experience and travel&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel’s long life was also marked by boldness and curiosity. At 18, she traveled to India to work as a nanny, embracing new cultures and challenges. Later, she lived in Hong Kong and Gibraltar with her husband, a British army major. These experiences likely enriched her life and kept her mentally engaged, another important factor linked to healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite frequent moves and changes, Ethel’s calm demeanor never wavered. She raised two daughters in the UK and continued to live with strength and grace, even after the loss of her husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;115 years of life, love, and calm: What Ethel teaches us about longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethel recently celebrated her 115th birthday surrounded by friends, family, and caregivers. Beyond the impressive number, her story is a reminder that longevity is about quality as much as quantity.

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, often says that when his uncle was president in the early 1960s, Americans were much healthier than they are now. People were thinner and had lower rates of chronic disease, he recalls. Fewer children had autism, allergies or autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On Thursday, the Trump administration &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/kennedy-trump-maha-report.html" title=""&gt;released a report on children’s health&lt;/a&gt; premised on the idea that we’ve fallen far since this golden era. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But were Americans really healthier back then?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The U.S. population was much younger in the 1960s, at the tail end of the Baby Boom, which complicates comparisons. Only 12.4 percent of the population was 65 or older in 1963, compared with 17.7 percent now. Rates of chronic diseases generally increase with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Americans must be doing something right: Life expectancy has increased. A child born today can expect to live almost a decade longer than a child born in 1960. That’s partly because advances in medical care mean that conditions that were deadly decades ago can be kept in check for longer now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“If R.F.K. Jr. makes the statement that more people are dying of chronic diseases now than in Jack Kennedy’s era, that’s undoubtedly true — we’ve got twice as many people, and a much larger chunk are old folks who have much higher chronic disease rates,” said Kenneth Warner, dean emeritus of the University of Michigan School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Does that mean we’re doing worse than back then?” he added. “Absolutely not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Americans have put on the pounds over the decades, as Mr. Kennedy often notes. Diabetes and obesity are on the rise even among adolescents. On the other hand, the country has cut back dramatically on smoking, a habit that once contributed to huge numbers of deaths in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Researchers analyzed samples from PCS patients and identified key immune and gut-related biomarkers linked to inflammation and intestinal barrier dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, altered levels of IL-6 and a higher LBP/sCD14 ratio suggest chronic immune activation in PCS sufferers. These findings suggest gut monitoring may be vital in predicting and managing long-term post-COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; PCS patients showed increased inflammatory markers like IL-6 and an elevated LBP/sCD14 ratio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut Health Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Individuals with prior gastrointestinal symptoms were more likely to develop post-viral fatigue.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Monitoring gut-related biomarkers may help identify and treat PCS earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Medical University of Vienna&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a recent study, a research team from the Medical University of Vienna has gained new insights into post-COVID syndrome (PCS) and the relevance of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was recently published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Allergy&lt;/em&gt;, shows that PCS patients have altered inflammatory markers and a disturbed intestinal barrier, which could contribute to the development of post-viral fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110289"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a man holding his stomach." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/gut-inflammation-post-COVID-fatigue-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In addition, there were increased IL-6 levels, which are considered a marker for systemic inflammatory reactions. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber from MedUni Vienna’s Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, analyzed data from a prospective observational study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course of SARS-CoV-2 infections and gastrointestinal symptoms before, during and after the infection were examined. In addition, blood, saliva and stool samples from PCS patients were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal complaints have an increased risk of developing PCS fatigue. At the same time, prominent changes were found in certain biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, PCS patients showed an increased LBP/sCD14 ratio and lower IL-33 levels, which indicates altered immune activation and a reduced intestinal barrier. In addition, there were increased IL-6 levels, which are considered a marker for systemic inflammatory reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can have long-term effects on the immune system and intestinal health that contribute to the development of PCS,” explains Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber. She is co-director of the National Reference Center for Postviral Syndromes at MedUni Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developing targeted treatment strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study underlines the central role of the gastrointestinal tract in the development of long-term consequences after COVID-19. Monitoring gastrointestinal symptoms and biomarkers could help to identify at-risk patients at an early stage and develop targeted treatment strategies. This could be particularly important for the treatment of post-viral fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What is particularly exciting is that our study participants were mostly young and healthy before the infection. Even the Covid disease was mostly mild or even asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One difference was the more frequently reported gastrointestinal complaints in the group that developed post-viral fatigue,” explains Johanna Rohrhofer from the Center for Pathophysiology Infectiology and Immunology, lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team plans to validate the findings in further studies. “The identification of predictive markers for PCS could enable personalized prevention and treatment in the future,” says Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this post COVID fatigue research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ea9a988f99998faa878f8e9f84839d838f84c48b89c48b9e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karin Kirschbichler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://meduniwien.ac.at" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medical University of Vienna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Karin Kirschbichler – Medical University of Vienna&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/all.16593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gastrointestinal Barrier Disruption in Post-COVID Syndrome Fatigue Patients&lt;/a&gt;” by Eva Untersmayr-Elsenhuber et al. &lt;em&gt;Allergy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastrointestinal Barrier Disruption in Post-COVID Syndrome Fatigue Patients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0001-title"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-COVID Syndrome (PCS) is the term for a condition with persistent symptoms in a proportion of COVID-19 patients after asymptomatic, mild, or severe disease courses. Numbers vary, but the current estimate is that after COVID-19 approximately 10% develop PCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and associations with the development of PCS with fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM), orthostatic dysregulation, autonomous dysregulation, and/or neurocognitive dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0002-title"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining medical record data from a prospective observational study with symptom analysis before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we aimed to identify potential risk factors and predictive markers for PCS. Additionally, we analyzed blood, saliva, and stool samples from this well-characterized PCS patient cohort to biologically validate our findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0003-title"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified significant associations between pre-existing GI complaints and the development of PCS Fatigue. PCS patients showed higher LBP/sCD14 ratios, lower IL-33 levels, and higher IL-6 levels compared to control groups. Our results highlight the critical role of the GI tract in PCS development of post-viral Fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="all16593-sec-0004-title"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose that the viral infection disrupts pathways related to the innate immune response and GI barrier function, evidenced by intestinal low-grade inflammation and GI barrier leakage. Monitoring GI symptoms and markers before, during, and after SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for identifying predictive clinical phenotypes in PCS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the interaction between viral infections, immune responses, and gut integrity could lead to more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies, ultimately reducing the burden on PCS patients.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 15:54:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5GRXdjSngyTDBRVk05b3Vhd0JrUkpzVFV0SV8xSnRYT1dCRWFZMlhobm5vRVBHaDRvMHdlSVdZREpHcGRwT0Q4SUJqZUF1ekx6Y0MyY215d2M0Q0ZmVktmOWtfMzlMOWtVRlpRcjlaZklCdlg0YTBocVE3QQ</guid></item><item><title>向度假者发出警告，因为美国度假热点受到维多利亚时代致命疾病“令人担忧”上升的打击-每日邮报 | Warning to holidaymakers as US vacation hotspot hit by 'worrying' rise in killer Victorian-era disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hawaii/index.html" id="mol-8e41d560-3717-11f0-bf19-131624c38f94" class=""&gt;Hawaii&lt;/a&gt; health officials are asking visitors to ensure they are vaccinated against whooping cough as cases reach an all-time high in the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this week, the state's Department of Health reported 108 cases of the Victorian-era disease — dubbed the 100-day cough — a stark increase from last year's 84 total cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to data from the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-46831e30-371e-11f0-9ee9-c37da55ef89e"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 10,000 cases of the coughing malady and nearly a dozen deaths have already been reported across the country this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14667277/whooping-cough-infection-cases-rise-17-fold-year-ukhsa-vaccinated.html"&gt;highly contagious respiratory infection&lt;/a&gt; caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis and mainly affects infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness leads to violent coughing fits, fever, sore eyes and blue lips. In severe cases, it can also lead to vomiting, exhaustion and breathing issues and is fatal in about one percent of babies who catch the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Given the sudden increase in cases, Dr Sarah Kemble, Hawaii State Health Department epidemiologist released a statement asking all adults - particularly those with infants - to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'Whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads through the air via the coughs or sneezes of an infected person&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's particularly important for families that are expecting a baby, so pregnant women, but also grandparents who are going to be holding the baby, dads who are going to be holding the baby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hawaii health officials are asking visitors to ensure they are vaccinated against whooping cough as cases reach an all-time high in the state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So everyone in the household who may be spending a lot of time around a newborn infant, we recommend that they also get their booster for pertussis.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The illness is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, with the first signs typically being a runny nose and sore throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within a week, sufferers may develop coughing bouts which last minutes, struggle to breathe after coughing and make a 'whoop' sound between coughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials said health complications can also lead to pneumonia, seizures, brain damage and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC recommends the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination for children, teenagers as well as adults.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The agency recommends babies get the DTaP (tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis) vaccine at two, four, six, and between 15 and 18 months old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children ages four to six are also recommended to receive a booster shot of the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC also states that preteens between the ages 11 to 12 should also receive a shot of Tdap to boost their immunity against pertussis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shot is recommended every 10 years after that to adults including pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2023, about 87 percent of toddlers in Hawaii had received their DTaP vaccine shot as compared to a national average of 92.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The TDAP vaccine is 98 percent effective in children within a year of their last dose. In teenagers, the vaccine is 73 percent effective in the first year and 34 percent effective four years after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But fewer are getting it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Sarah Kemble, Hawaii State Health Department epidemiologist released a statement asking all adults - particularly those with infants - to be vaccinated.

This dropped to 93 percent for the 2023-2024 school year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of 2024, over 35,000 cases across all age groups were reported in the US out of which about 10 people died, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, officials in Hawaii reported only three cases of whooping cough and no deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe that the sudden jump in cases in the tourist hotspot is due to increased vaccine hesitancy and decreased immunity in adults as well as older children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also warn even tiny dips in vaccine uptake allow the ultra-infectious virus to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials are also concerned that the confirmation of Health Secretary nominee Robert F Kennedy Jr may worsen whooping cough vaccination rates as the 71-year-old has expressed doubts about the efficacy of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to the introduction of the pertussis vaccine in 1948, the US saw as many as 250,000 cases per year, but they have steadily dropped by more than 90 percent each year compared to the pre-vaccine era, the CDC states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC has also noted that the bacteria that causes whooping cough, Bordetella pertussis, is prone to mutations, which could make it able to evade vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The illness is initially difficult to tell apart from a cold, with the first signs typically being a runny nose and sore throat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials have been warning for months that the US is on track to see a staggering rise in pertussis cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami told CBS: 'We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Researchers tracked nearly 12,000 youth over three years and discovered that increased screen time predicted later depression, while depressive symptoms did not predict more social media use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kids’ average daily social media use jumped from 7 to 73 minutes, and symptoms of depression rose by 35%. The findings suggest social media may play a causal role in the development of mental health issues, particularly when exposure includes risks like cyberbullying and poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Direction of Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Social media use predicts depressive symptoms, not vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarming Trends:&lt;/strong&gt; Screen time rose tenfold; depressive symptoms increased 35%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberbullying Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Victims were over 2.5x more likely to report suicidal thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As rates of depression and suicide in youth spike, experts are asking whether social media makes kids depressed, or do depressed kids simply spend more time on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study provides answers. Researchers at UC San Francisco found that as preteens used more social media, their depressive symptoms increased. Yet the reverse wasn’t true — a rise in depressive symptoms didn’t predict a later increase in social media use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, kids’ social media use rose from seven to 73 minutes per day over the three years of the study and their depressive symptoms went up 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), was published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Jason Nagata, MD, MSc, associate professor in UCSF’s Department of Pediatrics, examined data following nearly 12,000 kids aged 9 to 10 years and then three years later at 12 to 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is among the first to use within-person longitudinal data, meaning researchers could track changes over time in each child to accurately assess the link between social media and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There has been ongoing debate about whether social media contributes to depression or simply reflects underlying depressive symptoms,” said Nagata. “These findings provide evidence that social media may be contributing to the development of depressive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s unclear why social media increases depressive symptoms, prior research points to risks such as cyberbullying and disrupted sleep. In fact, Nagata and team just published a separate study in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Regional Health – Americas&lt;/em&gt; looking at the same cohort of participants, focusing instead on the effects of cyberbullying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found kids aged 11 to 12 years who were cyberbullied were 2.62 times more likely to report suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt one year later. Additionally, those kids were also 2.31 times more likely to experiment with a substance (4.65 times more likely with marijuana, 3.37 with nicotine, and 1.92 with alcohol) in the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, the youngest generations find themselves facing a catch-22, with growing evidence that social media is associated with depressive symptoms and risky behavior, yet it is also a primary area for them to connect and communicate with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this reality, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests using the tools in its Family Media Plan to create healthier digital habits for both kids and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a father of two young kids, I know that simply telling children to ‘get off your phone’ doesn’t really work,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parents can lead by example with open, nonjudgmental conversations about screen use. Setting screen-free times for the whole family, such as during meals or before bed, can help build healthier digital habits for everyone, including adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; UCSF authors are Jason M.

Sample sizes varied across waves and measures due to attrition and missing data. Analyses retained all available data at each wave. Data were analyzed from January 2024 to March 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported time spent on social media at baseline to 3-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal associations between social media use and depressive symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist) at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 years of follow-up were assessed using longitudinal, cross-lagged structural equation panel models. Covariates included sex, race and ethnicity, household income, and parental educational level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the sample included 11 876 participants (mean [SD] age, 9.9 [0.6] years), of whom 6196 (52.2%) were male. After adjusting for stable between-person differences and covariates, within-person increases in social media use above the person-level mean were associated with elevated depressive symptoms from year 1 to year 2 (β, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01-0.12; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .01) and from year 2 to year 3 (β, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.04-0.14; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001), whereas depressive symptoms were not associated with subsequent social media use at any interval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final random-intercept cross-lagged panel model demonstrated a good fit (comparative fit index, 0.977; Tucker-Lewis index, 0.968; root mean square error of approximation, 0.031 [90% CI, 0.029-0.033]). Between-person differences in social media use were not associated with depressive symptoms (β, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.04 to 0.02; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .46) after accounting for demographic and family-level factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this cohort study of 11 876 children and adolescents, reporting higher than person-level mean social media use in years 1 and 2 after baseline was associated with greater depressive symptoms in the subsequent year. The findings suggest that clinicians should provide anticipatory guidance regarding social media use for young adolescents and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 15:30:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE1JUWFfQjJYYTdTcUJvRnBZUktYdmZIQjVwY1k1R2otTnNkM2pZdmY5RGlkMUVnWVZieFMyaHdIMV9iU2txQjNjajFLSjd2VlI4eDc3Y0x5MzNFYWxlR0g4UjFBNWtnZy1MNUttSDNWNUtTZw</guid></item><item><title>皮肤科医生揭示了令人难以置信的微妙线索，即您的小痘痘实际上是癌症-每日邮报 | Dermatologist reveals incredibly subtle clue that your tiny pimple is actually cancer - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxNclpXQURPVHBmaUw5V21BWWpIdnVMcmcxbGpzdjhMdTFEUk1vYmpqeUNVTHN6SDdBUVBVSWFncDloc1N1Q2F0dDBSdlZTZHY2LVZqclZTemp4RngtLWtPRF81UVZjMThJdkFFUkQxci1GYU5rVGFlR0ZNSnEtY051MU9PRGJLT3V1TXhBX0ZOeW91MmRtT0FSc2J0dTLSAaIBQVVfeXFMTTNYSUVLY0tFZDhxbHJta2FBaDdMLU1tY09MUXR5ejFXMVNKMkpXZS1yN0xjSnVSY3daUTNMbXJNN2FKQkhMcldNZXhzbDhlaXI1RFZmZDRaX21mdGJJTjQzR2xhSmxvT1FUaGkybGg0TXN2bWd4ZU9ZdFJCem1CM0RaclBwVElsOUN1bWNxQVhyX1ExOU5rX1B5OTg5cXdHZkRR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top dermatologist has flagged a little-known sign of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-07552a10-3718-11f0-b9b2-c5f94a3b7f4b"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; that patients often mistake for a hormonal spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the 'pimple' scabs over and bleeds, it's likely skin cancer, according to Harvard-trained dermatologist Dr Daniel Sugai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an Instagram video that's so far attracted more than 134,000 views, Dr Sugai warned that the most common form of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), 'does not have to be an obvious growth on the face'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, it can be a small, non-healing sore, bump or even a patch of flat, scaly skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the video, he listed common symptoms of cancer he sees in his patients who have missed the warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'A complaint I hear patients say is that "I just washed my face and there's this one spot that keeps bleeding", and it does this bleed-scab cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So if you have a spot that's not fully healing or is very fragile with gentle trauma like washing your face, definitely see your dermatologist.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is likely because BCCs are typically fragile tumors and can develop blood vessels to help them grow, making them more prone to bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In a viral video shared to Instagram with more than 134,000 views, Dr Daniel Sugai warned that basal cell carcinoma (BCC) 'does not have to be an obvious growth on the face', and even your average spot could be a warning sign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For people of colour, a bump will grow and become darker than the surrounding skin, the top dermatologist said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sugai also advised if that pesky pimple doesn't go away after four weeks it could be cancer, and you should consult your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the average spot will go away in about a week, a skin cancer bump will not heal on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those with darker skin, a bump will grow and become darker than the surrounding skin, the top dermatologist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For my patients who have skin of colour, I will find a pigmented basal cell most commonly and it's usually hyperpigmented with some red mixed in. And with time it will start to bleed easily.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Upon closer inspection with a dermatoscope, even the tiniest of spots can be skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pointing to an example, he said: 'This tiny spot on the lip was skin cancer and most people would have ignored it because it's flat and wasn't bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked up close and I was able to see these concerning features. There's tree-like blood vessles and I can see some small scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I took a biopsy of it and it turned out to be a basal cell carcinoma. I diagnose these everyday and I actually treat them surgically everyday.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pointing to an example, he said the tree-like blood vessles small scarring were an indication of BCC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Dr Sugai's biggest for avoiding the deadly cancer is wearing sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'People don't realise that the first 20 years of life is so important in terms of sun protection, because getting those sunburns early on in life will definitely affect how healthy your DNA is later on in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're starting late in the sunscreen game, it's never too late. Keep wearing your sunscreen because we don't want to overwhelm our skin with DNA mutations that are induced from the sun.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It takes a scarily low number of sunburns—only five—to make you vulnerable to the condition that kills more than 2,000 people in the UK every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 75,000 people are diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma (BCC) each year and the condition accounts for approximately 70 per cent of all skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike the deadliest type, melanoma, these cancers are slow growing and doctors can almost always cure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, patients often have to undergo invasive operations to remove large chunks of their skin in order to destroy the cancer—which can be disfiguring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most harmful type of sunrays are UVB which hit the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) and cause the most sunburn, as well as UVA rays which penetrate much deeper and contribute to ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both are ultraviolet, which means they cause skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A worrying 90 per cent of skin cancer cases in the UK are a direct result of sunburn and using sunbeds, according to Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 15:12:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxNclpXQURPVHBmaUw5V21BWWpIdnVMcmcxbGpzdjhMdTFEUk1vYmpqeUNVTHN6SDdBUVBVSWFncDloc1N1Q2F0dDBSdlZTZHY2LVZqclZTemp4RngtLWtPRF81UVZjMThJdkFFUkQxci1GYU5rVGFlR0ZNSnEtY051MU9PRGJLT3V1TXhBX0ZOeW91MmRtT0FSc2J0dTLSAaIBQVVfeXFMTTNYSUVLY0tFZDhxbHJta2FBaDdMLU1tY09MUXR5ejFXMVNKMkpXZS1yN0xjSnVSY3daUTNMbXJNN2FKQkhMcldNZXhzbDhlaXI1RFZmZDRaX21mdGJJTjQzR2xhSmxvT1FUaGkybGg0TXN2bWd4ZU9ZdFJCem1CM0RaclBwVElsOUN1bWNxQVhyX1ExOU5rX1B5OTg5cXdHZkRR</guid></item><item><title>感染者参加售罄的夏奇拉秀后，新泽西州的麻疹警报- HuffPost | Measles Alert In New Jersey After Infected Person Attends Sold-Out Shakira Show - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxOODJQY3JUNGV4T3psWGRfM2JJNXRTZGhva09ETWZlc2Y4cnlKZ3FCZnBUSVF6SlVaN2hyZG9ScXM3VGJSMDJXVmNudGxvMUwyZElGZTQ3eE1fZmF3VkVzNFU2MDdkRGZUZ0dRclRvSkdOc0w2alRWMUo1eTBGRTB0dlAtalk0Y2FnaEw0dzVPaVdXUFUwSTRidHlWR09ud9IBowFBVV95cUxPbC1MOHJGZXBrVmNrX19pX19CUDA3MkUwdzJNV1hqZjhpQmJsb01VTHhjWWdyQ25UX2xLRW1XQW5HSTNfdDFEMmNOM2ZjUzhpWTFEXzhZd2lzWUVZV0NfeDNYNDhfT0tmMkRSTmdYcm1hakJUMndjM0J6eVExOUlTWjQ5ZncxckVMYzdoUUZORG9kcldRSmwxN1VsalBWTG5SY1hz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people may have been exposed to measles in New Jersey after attending a sold-out Shakira concert last week, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;An out-of-state resident infected with the highly contagious virus attended the “Whenever, Wherever” singer’s May 15 show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, the state’s Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250520a.shtml" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="announced" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682f2646e4b0ef574bf5dbff" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250520a.shtml" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person, whose exact seating in the stadium was not shared, was at the venue from 7:30 p.m. until 1 a.m. the following morning.

— a bat-linked infection caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People become infected after inhaling spores of the fungus that thrive in bat feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say up to 40 percent of people with serious cases die from the disease, which infects the lungs and in serious cases spreads to other organs including the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No family members died from the infection, and within 28 days of the cave visit — and following treatment — all were making a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The family had visited the Venado cave in Costa Rica, where they crawled through bat feces for two hours and saw scores of living bats (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the CDC, which investigated the cases, said it underscored the dangers of visiting bat-infested caves and crawling through feces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The news comes on the&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/tv/article-14725961/The-fans-left-tears-Pedro-Pascals-shock-return-major-question-finally-answered.html"&gt; eve of the finale&lt;/a&gt; of The Last of Us season two, a hit HBO series where the modern world is turned on its head after whole cities are infected with a fungus that turns them into rabid zombies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Histoplasmosis is often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late because it symptoms, which are similar to pneumonia, can be mistaken for a bacteria or fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fungus behind the infection is spread in bird and bat droppings, and also lives in the soil — including in the central and eastern US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It does not spread between people, and also does not spread between animals if they become infected with the fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the cases in its &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7417a1.htm"&gt;Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said only one family member did not get sick — the individual who did not go on the cave tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family visited the caves on Christmas Eve 2024. They were in Costa Rica for a week, from December 21 to 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the sick patients, six family members were adults aged between 42 and 49 years old and six were children, aged between eight and 16 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only two family members tested positive for the fungus out of the four tested using a swab for fungus-fighting antibodies in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said more family members were likely infected, however, adding that in more mild cases it can be difficult to detect the antibodies in tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The caves were also linked to 51 cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed in 1998 and 1999&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other 11 patients were suspected to have the disease, given the trip and their links to the patient who tested positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The caves were also linked to a histoplasmosis outbreak between 1998 and 1999 that sickened 51 people, including tourists and Costa Rican residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests carried out on bat feces samples from the cave revealed they contained the fungus that causes the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms appeared within eight to 19 days of visiting the caves, with no family members reporting other sources of infection since the trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors are recommended to prescribe the antifungal itraconazole to treat the infection, but only in more serious cases. In mild cases of the fungal infection, the disease normally goes away on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some family members were initially prescribed antibiotics, which is not recommended because these could worsen the infection. The prescriptions suggest that the fungal infection was not initially suspected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says the fungus that causes histoplasmosis lives along the Ohio and Mississippi river deltas. It has been detected in states in eastern, southern and midwestern areas of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Thoracic Society &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thoracic.org/patients/patient-resources/resources/histoplasmosis.pdf"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that up to 250,000 people suffer from histoplasmosis in the US every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Few of these cases are formally diagnosed and reported, however, with only about 4,600 cases &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538056/"&gt;recorded annually&lt;/a&gt; according to CDC data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 120 people die from the disease every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 14:40:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>关闭阅读适合所有人-叛逃者 | Close Reading Is For Everyone - Defector</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5tbDBXc2t0SGw4b0plSmdLVEJqR0xoREtMNlVsMFdGUDU5VTZ1TGF5RHNCYlF3ZFR6SjFJa25VUEtFVGNlc0YwYTE3VUpIX3pBRkc4YzZFZng2WmM5WmZz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="PostContent_content__FblEJ"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sigrid Nunez’s 2018 novel &lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;, a famous writer kills himself. Not long before, he complains to the narrator about readers: “People talking about a book as if it were just another thing, like a dish, or a product like an electronic device or a pair of shoes, to be rated for customer satisfaction—that was just the goddamn trouble.” Students submit papers that say, “I hate Joyce, he’s so full of himself.” Online reviewers imply, “if a book didn’t affirm what the reader already felt—what they could identify with, what they could relate to—the author had no business writing the book at all.” The famous author quits teaching, quits writing. The state of the novel, its place in the world, is too depressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But hasn’t it always been this way?” asks the narrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No doubt,” says the famous writer. “But in the past the writer didn’t have to know, the problem wasn’t right there in your face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know it’s been this way—or something like it—for more than a century, because that’s how long it’s been since I. A. Richards conducted his experiment. A young Cambridge professor in the 1920s, Richards printed poems with their authors redacted, sent them home with his students, and asked them to produce commentary. They did, and their commentary, from these otherwise good students, was riddled with errors. Without the context of who wrote the poems or when, the students failed to make out the plain sense. They connected poems to irrelevant memories, offered stock responses, indulged in sentimentality, and allowed preconceptions about what poetry is to skew what they saw on the page. At a time when literature professors either lectured grandly or lingered over the minutiae of history, Richards set out a new path; he wanted to provide support for “those who wish to discover for themselves what they think and feel about poetry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading, a skill easily taken for granted, is difficult—all the more so when reading literature that wields language as a medium for art. In the wake of Richards' revelations, scholars in Britain and the United States developed a technique to address our failures. Eventually that technique took the name "close reading," and it remains the principal methodology of literary studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Close reading is untimely. It bristles against today’s universities, which treat students as customers to please and as future workers to train rather than as people in pursuit of human flourishing. Jeff Bezos’ empire—Amazon; Goodreads; Kindle Direct Publishing, which dominates the perfervid world of self-publishing—encourages readers to “talk about a book as if it were just another thing, like a dish, or a product like an electronic device.” Social media compels us to attend to what we’re seeing for as long as it takes to scroll by. Every day, AI produces more of the words we come across, making it hard—maybe impossible—to care about reading them. I’m sure there were college courses this semester where students completed their work with AI and professors graded it with AI, cutting humans from the loop. It’s easy to see why close reading, which demands patience, openness to others, and slow, careful thought, is having a moment among academics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, literary critic John Guillory, emeritus faculty at NYU, well known in the small world of literary studies, published a slim volume, &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo239363263.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Close Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by an exhaustive annotated bibliography compiled by Rhodes College professor Scott Newstok that demonstrated that more people are writing about close reading now than ever. Jonathan Kramnick’s &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo208342791.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Criticism and Truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has garnered disproportionate attention, occasioning roundtables, special sections of journals, and many reviews. Much more, including a volume I co-edited, is forthcoming. After a spell of taking it for granted, academics are rediscovering the quiet excitement of close reading, a relief from the overheated corporate pablum routinely suffocating us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But close reading is not just for academics, and it deserves a bigger audience. Not because it’s virtuous. Not because it makes us better people. (I know some great close readers who are real assholes.) But because it’s a thrilling way to think with others, to claw back some of the time taken from us daily by tech oligarchs (I have looked at Twitter impulsively several times while writing this pointedly long, difficult sentence), and relearn some of our capacity, atrophied into passivity by algorithms, for aesthetics, a term that arose in modernity to name a storehouse of values in dialectical opposition to those of capitalism: above all, treating texts as ends in themselves rather than as means to productive ends—treating them, that is, as art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is close reading? As my co-editor and I write in our book, “Close reading is the practice of paying attention to a passage of text to account for at least one aspect of its meaning and to make an argument about how it works.” Close reading ought not only be right but elegant. At best, it’s akin to the performance of a great athlete, giving its witnesses the sense that they’ve seen something true and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the best way to get a sense of it is to read someone else doing it, and the best place to start is with Erich Auerbach, a German Jewish philologist who lost his professorship under the Nuremberg Laws and fled to Istanbul, where he wrote his opus, a gripping study of Western literature from Homer to Virginia Woolf, &lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160221/mimesis?srsltid=AfmBOooXvBE-S9rTAqBqjKT2VWAfKvR80Klm30KWGiExgVf24tcNDKza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mimesis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He was a model for many of the most influential figures in literary studies: Stephen Greenblatt, Fredric Jameson, Edward Said. He’s a secret source of so much of what happens in literature departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in &lt;em&gt;The Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;, Odysseus, who has endured 10 years of wandering to return home from the Trojan War, encounters his childhood nurse. No one has yet recognized him, and he does not want to be recognized. He appears a stranger. His erstwhile nurse washes his feet and, in doing so, sees a scar on his thigh, startling her into recognition. The mark on the body becomes, once noticed by a caring, knowing observer, auratic, suffused with meaning. At that moment, Homer interrupts the story with some 70 lines about how Odysseus suffered the wound that left the scar, only to pick up when the nurse drops Odysseus’ foot in the basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might think, given how we have learned to read stories in our time, that Homer interjects the history of the scar into the scene to induce a feeling of suspense, suggests Auerbach. But we would be wrong. Suspense requires a distinction between foreground and background, which is unknown to Homer, who writes everything in a fully saturated &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;. While narrating the history of the scar, he does not expect us to be waiting to find out what happens with the nurse. He expects us, argues Auerbach, to be 100 percent in the presence of the past. Homer must describe the scar because if he did not, we would be left with an unexplained, mysterious detail, which he cannot bear. Everything must be illuminated. He must account for the scar. Everything in Homer proceeds with clarity, “never a lacuna, never a gap, never a glimpse of unplumbed depth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auerbach sketches out this reading in &lt;em&gt;Mimesis&lt;/em&gt;’s first five pages. Then: “The genius of the Homeric style becomes even more apparent when it is compared with an equally ancient and equally epic style from a different world of forms.” Auerbach turns to the Binding, told in full in 19 verses of the 22nd chapter of the Book of Genesis. It is very short. God commands Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Abraham prepares to do so, but at the last minute, God, satisfied by Abraham’s show of faith, relieves him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auerbach quotes the opening, from the King James Bible: “And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham! and he said, Behold, here I am.” I’d bet most readers—that is, you—don’t find anything particularly notable about this quote. You might, like me, have grown up with a monotheistic religion, making this kind of language overly familiar. Or maybe religion is too foreign to you to make anything of it at all. Learning to see what lies hidden before our eyes is part of the magic of close reading. Auerbach is a master at this. He teaches us how to notice. “Even this opening startles us,” he writes, “when we come to it from Homer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where does God come from to speak with Abraham? “He does not come, like Zeus or Poseidon, from the Aethiopians, where he has been enjoying a sacrificial feast.” Instead, he comes from the cryptic depths of background, from which he never fully emerges. “Nor are we told anything of his reasons for tempting Abraham so terribly,” writes Auerbach. “He has not, like Zeus, discussed them in set speeches with other gods gathered in council.” Why such opacity? Auerbach, ventriloquizing an interlocutor, offers that opacity is just in the nature of the Jewish God. But that is no answer: or it leads us to ask why opacity is in the nature of the Jewish God. Rather, in the kind of inversion that has become routine in the humanities, but nevertheless in Auerbach’s hands still dazzles, “The concept of God held by the Jews is less a cause than a symptom of their manner of comprehending and representing things.” The Jews did not create a style to fit their God; they created a God to fit their style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can learn about a people through its style, its literature, which bears an ineradicable record of its version of reality. This, at least, was Auerbach’s gambit. The method is close reading. Others do it differently and can be no less exhilarating. It starts with a cultivation of sensitivity to art and language, for no other reason than that, which runs counter to the great powers that profit from our clicks, our data, our hustle. It’s not easy to travel upstream, but it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By middle age, the mind loses much of its lability. Or, speaking for myself, &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;mind. When I was young, words more easily disturbed, elated, shocked, and surprised me. I don’t think art will ever grip me again like it did when I was 17, before I had a mental place to put each thing, before I had seen it all. But close reading gets me closest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you begin if you’ve never taken a literature course—or if it’s been a decade or three? You must acknowledge that its words are how they are for a reason, their placement is purposeful, thus meaningful. Every word is a clue. No skimming. You must (metaphorically) listen to the text: what is it trying to do—to you. You might start with a poem or a novel you’ve read before, one you’d like to understand better. You might already have hunches about what it’s about. These might be confirmed upon rereading, or pleasingly foiled. As you read, a line might hit you. You feel struck. You pause. Here’s where close reading happens. Hold up. Linger with that line. Read it again, a few more times. What gives it its force &lt;em&gt;here &lt;/em&gt;in its immediate moment? Work out its power. Does it reveal something about the text’s project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I read Karl Ove Knausgaard’s &lt;a href="https://archipelagobooks.org/book/my-struggle-book-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Struggle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his six-volume opus, a retelling of his life in excruciating and, to me, utterly compelling detail. Then I reread it. A passage early in the first volume held me. “Understanding the world requires you to take a certain distance from it,” he writes. “Throughout our childhood and teenage years, we strive to attain the correct distance to objects and phenomena. We read, we learn, we experience, we make adjustments. Then one day we reach the point where all the necessary distances have been set, all the necessary systems have been put in place. This is when time begins to pick up speed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I read these lines, something clicked. I had a feeling they held a key to Knausgaard’s whole monstrous epic. He wants to stop time. More, he wants to go back in time, to restore the experience of childhood, before we lost our mental lability, before we tamed the world. As I &lt;a href="https://post45.org/2016/06/my-struggle-volume-1-dan-june-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; then,“His meticulous descriptions of rolling a cigarette, or the sound of a VHS rewinding, or the weather, and his abrupt scalar shifts to the geometric patterns of cities or the life cycle of delivery rooms or funeral parlors are bids to break our habitual understanding of the world and thereby dilate time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knausgaard has a reputation for disarming simplicity, openness, innocence, and honesty. Though he calls &lt;em&gt;My Struggle &lt;/em&gt;fiction, readers take it as true. But he admits many times that he has a poor memory. “His transparency,” I wrote, “is an illusion.” &lt;em&gt;My Struggle &lt;/em&gt;is utter artifice. It is a desperate effort to make the world meaningful again. Not unlike close reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meaningfulness doesn’t happen alone. Close reading, as much as it can seem a solitary practice, is social—explicitly in my analysis of Knausgaard, which I wrote as an &lt;a href="https://post45.org/2016/06/my-struggle-volume-1-dan-june-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to a few critic friends who were reading it with me. We published our letters as epistolary criticism. That only foregrounded what is always true: Close reading requires someone you want to persuade, someone whose judgment you care about, and for whom you want your ideas about art and life to matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Sigrid Nunez’s &lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;, the famous writer fails to kill himself. Or so we discover in the penultimate chapter, which presents the rest of the novel as written by the narrator to imagine what it would have been like had her friend succeeded. He feels betrayed that she has written about him, however fictionalized, while he was institutionalized. For most of the book, the narrator addresses her dead friend as "you," but in the final chapter, the "you"&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shifts to his dog, whom she has adopted, and onto whom her love for her friend has been transferred. She takes the old, infirm Great Dane to a house on the ocean where she can minister to him while he lives out his last days. Unlike her friend, who survives in &lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;’s belatedly revealed primary world, the dog cannot express betrayal, cannot, as a dog, even feel betrayed; he can only feel, for her, she hopes, love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Friend&lt;/em&gt;, like the Old Testament, is laden with latent meaning. It demands interpretation. What can writing do? How does it do it? Nunez acknowledges that now is not an auspicious time for fiction. Creative writing has been professionalized, publishing conglomerated. Everyone wants to write, no one wants to read—or so we’re told. Nunez, by publishing her cryptic novel, confesses her faith that readers persist, and that if fiction works it is thanks to those readers. Not just any readers, but those with faith, in turn, in art: close readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Defector</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 14:23:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5tbDBXc2t0SGw4b0plSmdLVEJqR0xoREtMNlVsMFdGUDU5VTZ1TGF5RHNCYlF3ZFR6SjFJa25VUEtFVGNlc0YwYTE3VUpIX3pBRkc4YzZFZng2WmM5WmZz</guid></item><item><title>植入设备在脊髓损伤后恢复手臂功能-神经科学新闻 | Implanted Device Restores Arm Function After Spinal Cord Injury - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE1rbnpuU2JBaUlzMTV5QUxkZkVEbmhjS0RrT1JMNkE5bGQxRGRza1lHeUQ1Ulp2Z1FadGtfRENUdll3UUlTeGx5bl9mdTZQTWtvUF9rLS10NnpZQ1poM0tLRktR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A groundbreaking clinical study shows that closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation (CLV), paired with rehabilitation, can significantly improve arm and hand function in people with chronic spinal cord injuries. The therapy uses a tiny implanted device that sends timed electrical pulses to the brain when patients perform successful movements, helping rewire neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who previously saw no benefit from therapy alone experienced unprecedented recovery through CLV, regardless of age, injury duration, or severity. These results mark a major step toward potential FDA approval and offer hope to patients with no current treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakthrough Recovery:&lt;/strong&gt; CLV led to major functional gains in upper limbs for spinal cord injury patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology:&lt;/strong&gt; A tiny implant sends electrical pulses during targeted movement therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Step:&lt;/strong&gt; A Phase 3 trial with 70 patients will test CLV’s efficacy for FDA approval.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Dallas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a new clinical study, researchers from the Texas Biomedical Device Center (TxBDC) at The University of Texas at Dallas demonstrated unprecedented rates of recovery for spinal cord injuries.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on May 21, individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury safely received a combination of stimulation of a nerve in the neck with progressive, individualized rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110269"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/VNS-sci-movement-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The implant was activated upon successful movements, resulting in significant benefits for arm and hand strength. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach, called closed-loop vagus nerve stimulation (CLV), produced meaningful improvements in arm and hand function in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented results position the UT Dallas scientists to proceed with a pivotal trial — the final hurdle on the road to potential Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of vagus nerve stimulation for treatment of upper-limb impairment due to spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach is based on over a decade of neuroscience and bioengineering efforts by investigators at UT Dallas. The therapy uses electrical pulses sent to the brain via a tiny device implanted in the neck and timed to occur during rehabilitative exercises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous work by UT Dallas researchers has demonstrated that stimulating the vagus nerve during physical therapy can rewire areas of the brain damaged by stroke and lead to improved recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Kilgard, the Margaret Fonde Jonsson Professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences and corresponding author, explained that treating spinal cord injury with CLV is different than conditions targeted in earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In stroke, people who do only therapy may get better, and adding CLV multiplies that improvement,” he said. “This study is different: Therapy alone for spinal cord injury didn’t help our participants at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial involved 19 participants with chronic, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury. Each person performed 12 weeks of therapy, playing simple video games to trigger specific upper-limb movements. The implant was activated upon successful movements, resulting in significant benefits for arm and hand strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These activities allow patients to regain strength, speed, range of motion and hand function. They simplify daily living,” said Dr. Robert Rennaker, professor of neuroscience and the Texas Instruments Distinguished Chair in Bioengineering, who designed the miniature implanted CLV device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study served as both a Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trial and included randomized placebo control in its first phase, in which nine of the 19 participants received sham stimulation rather than active treatment during the first 18 therapy sessions, then received CLV in the latter 18 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants ranged in age from 21 to 65 and were from one to 45 years post-injury. Neither of those factors, nor the severity of the impairment in those with any hand movement, influenced the degree of response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This approach produces results regardless of these factors, which often cause significant differences in success rates of other types of treatment,” said study co-author Dr. Jane Wigginton, medical doctor and chief medical officer at TxBDC, co-director of UTD’s Clinical and Translational Research Center, and medical science research director at the Center for BrainHealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is remarkable from a medical standpoint,” said Wigginton, who planned the clinical interactions and patient protections for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TxBDC has worked to treat a wide variety of conditions using CLV across 13 years of research. As a result, the FDA has approved vagus nerve stimulation for treating impaired upper-limb movement in stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wigginton said the latest results are especially exciting because they help people for whom there is no existing solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people in this study have now gained the ability to do things that are meaningful for them and impactful in their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest generation of the implantable CLV device, designed by Rennaker, is approximately 50 times smaller than their version from three years ago. It does not prevent patients from receiving MRIs, CT scans or ultrasounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Phase 3 pivotal trial will include 70 participants at multiple U.S. institutions that specialize in spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Seth Hays, associate professor of bioengineering and Fellow, Eugene McDermott Distinguished Professor in the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, has been with the CLV project dating back to the earliest studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prior to this study, no person with spinal cord injury had ever received CLV,” he said. “This is the first evidence that gains can be made. Now we will set about determining how we make this optimally effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hays cautioned that it is not a foregone conclusion that the therapy will make it to patients after the next trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have a long road ahead. For many reasons — financial, regulatory or scientific — this could still die on the vine,” he said. “But we have positioned ourselves to succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team emphasized the importance of the dozens of people involved in the work — both the patients and TxBDC’s partners at Baylor University Medical Center, Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Research Institute and Baylor Scott &amp;amp; White Institute for Rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This has been the hardest working, most altruistic group of professionals, and that has been incredibly impactful,” Wigginton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that even outpatient surgery is complex for those with impaired mobility, Rennaker added, “These patients said, ‘Put that device in me’ — that’s a huge commitment. They deserve credit for paving the path for others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other UTD-affiliated co-authors included Joseph Epperson BS’20, PhD’24, TxBDC research associate; cognition and neuroscience doctoral student Emmanuel Adehunoluwa MS’23; Amy Porter MBA’20, TxBDC director of operations; Holle Carey Gallaway MBA’23, TxBDC research biomedical engineer; and David Pruitt MS’14, PhD’16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kilgard has a financial interest in MicroTransponder Inc., which markets vagus nerve stimulation therapy for stroke.

Over four years, researchers tracked 238 children and found distinct patterns of symptoms depending on whether a parent had schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children of those with schizophrenia were more likely to show attention deficits, disruptive behaviors, and subclinical psychotic traits, while those with bipolar-affected parents showed more mood-related symptoms and subclinical bipolar signs. Protective factors such as strong parental functioning and higher socioeconomic status reduced the likelihood of problems, pointing to the importance of early monitoring and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Children of parents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are more vulnerable to mental health issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptom Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Schizophrenia is linked to attention and psychotic symptoms; bipolar disorder to mood symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Factors:&lt;/strong&gt; Better family functioning and socioeconomic support reduce risk in high-risk children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study confirms that children of people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a higher risk of developing psychopathology compared to children whose parents do not have these conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;European&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, examines how the clinical and social characteristics of parents influence the mental health of their offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study confirms this increased risk and helps to better understand what factors influence mental health problems patients’ children”, says Josefina Castro Fornieles, coordinator of the study and researcher in the Mental Health Networking Biomedical Research Centre (CIBERSAM), at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Barcelona, Hospital Clínic and the August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS). The study has been carried out in collaboration with the team of the researcher Dolores Moreno, from the Gregorio Marañón University Hospital in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts followed the children of patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder for four years, comparing them with a control group of parents without these pathologies. The study included 238 children (aged 6-17), who were assessed at the beginning and end of this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analysed variables such as parents’ and children’s psychiatric diagnoses, family socioeconomic status, parents’ age at childbirth and the presence of subclinical symptoms related to schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition, symptom patterns vary according to parental diagnosis”, says Elena de la Serna, CIBERSAM researcher at Hospital Clínic de Barcelona and first author of the article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study reveals that children of people with schizophrenia have a higher risk of attention deficit disorder, disruptive disorders and subclinical psychotic symptoms. In the case of bipolar disorder, children of affected patients show a higher prevalence of mood disorders, attention deficit disorder and subclinical bipolar symptoms”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights factors that can mitigate this risk. Thus, better parental psychosocial functioning and higher socioeconomic status are associated with a lower presence of mental health problems in children, underlining the relevance of family and social interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study, which is part of the BASYS (Bipolar and Schizophrenia Young Offspring Study) project, reinforces the importance of long-term follow-up of children of patients with severe mental illness and raises the need for preventive strategies in these high-risk populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although studies with larger samples are needed, this one contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms of intergenerational transmission of vulnerability to mental disorders in childhood and adolescence”, the team concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d8aab7abb9b5b9aaacb1b6bda298adbaf6bdbcad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rosa Martínez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ub.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rosa Martínez – University of Barcelona&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00787-025-02719-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of parental characteristics on the risk of psychopathology in offspring: a 4-year follow-up study&lt;/a&gt;” by Josefina Castro Fornieles et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;European Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of parental characteristics on the risk of psychopathology in offspring: a 4-year follow-up study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offspring of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (SZoff) or bipolar disorder (BDoff) have double the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we report the effects of some parental characteristics on the offspring risk of psychopathology at 4-year follow-up.

Parents’ and offspring’s psychiatric diagnoses as well as socio-economic status (SES) and global functioning were assessed in addition to parents’ ages at childbirth and offspring subclinical psychotic/bipolar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to assess between-group differences in the cumulative incidence of psychiatric disorders and subclinical psychotic/bipolar symptoms and the association of some offspring and parents’ variables with risk of psychopathology and subclinical psychotic/bipolar symptoms. SZoff and BDoff had a higher risk of psychopathology than CCoff at 4-year follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SZoff showed a higher risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), disruptive disorders and subclinical psychotic symptoms, whereas BDoff displayed a heightened risk for mood disorders, ADHD and subclinical bipolar symptoms when compared to CCoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher parental psychosocial functioning and SES were associated with a lower prevalence of psychopathology. Both SZoff and BDoff samples have a higher risk for psychopathology but the pattern of this psychopathology seems to be group specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer follow-up studies and larger sample sizes are needed to assess the capacity of psychopathological disorder and subclinical psychotic or bipolar symptoms to predict progression to fully-fledged disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 13:34:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPS3c0X2hWSHM0V2xfYzBRNXBlOV8xblVONkFQYUxWVXpFbE01c2tWWkJ1SzRVOWsxM2dWem9OWDhtbWtmNHNpLXdHTVhSaktFOTlPc2hjRmx4eFNsX2dVMzNtUGhtQjFtaVpjNmg5VTh2UmtLeEg5Q1I5UVA5aWY4WENlSG4</guid></item><item><title>钾通道药物为治疗抑郁症带来新希望-神经科学新闻 | Potassium Channel Drug Offers New Hope for Treating Depression - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1fYmc2Nzc2UkRTYXpjLTdYN25rSDRBcGdBYklIYlpPWFM4VEdqbDVPejdDWHVRbkhsR2FkU19xMG5aMlZtYVdsUnI1RzVxU2dRRjB2Mng1UVhsbnJPZjcydXhDV0k1YWdHMWYzX0FaZENHX2VZdWRoNHR3OTdvVkk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Two new studies reveal that ezogabine, a drug originally approved for epilepsy, may alleviate depression symptoms by targeting potassium channels in the brain. Researchers found that the drug improves function in reward-related brain regions like the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is key to motivation and pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine also reduced abnormal connectivity between reward centers and regions associated with negative thoughts, such as the posterior cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that potassium channel openers could offer a new, biology-based treatment strategy for depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Ezogabine targets KCNQ potassium channels to modulate brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reward Circuitry:&lt;/strong&gt; It normalizes overactive dopamine-related brain areas in depressed patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Shift:&lt;/strong&gt; Reduces connectivity between reward and negative emotion networks, easing symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A mechanism involving potassium channels in the brain that control brain cell activity could provide a new and fundamentally different way of treating depression symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder, according to two complementary papers published recently by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two new research articles, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers provide new insights into how a drug called ezogabine may impact the brain to improve depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depression is a devastating public health problem, and our understanding of what changes in the brain to cause the illness is still very limited,” says James Murrough, MD, PhD, Director of the Depression and Anxiety Center for Discovery and Treatment at Mount Sinai and senior author of both studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110261"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a head and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/mdd-ion-channel-pharmacology-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work represents a major step in unraveling the potential role of a specific protein complex in the brain—the KCNQ channel—and how targeting it could eventually offer a significant new modality for treating depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011 as an anticonvulsant medication for partial-onset seizures in adults with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous neuroscience research in mice, conducted by researchers at The Friedman Brain Institute at Mount Sinai, suggested that increasing KCNQ channel activity could also represent a new approach to treating depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on these findings, Dr. Murrough’s research team became the first to test the hypothesis in humans with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study, published in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; in 2021, revealed ezogabine was associated with significant improvements in depression symptoms and the ability to experience pleasure (anhedonia) in patients who were treated with the drug compared to patients who received placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two new papers provide details from new analyses of the human brain imaging data collected from that initial clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of the two papers, published in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, sheds light on the effects of ezogabine on a specific brain pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study examined the impact of ezogabine on the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, which is involved in the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter essential for motivation, pleasure, and reinforcement of behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging, showed an important role for KCNQ channel openers like ezogabine in normalizing hyperactivity of the VTA in people with both depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Up to half of people with depression do not respond to first-line treatment, which may be due to the lack of interventions that directly affect the neurobiology underlying symptoms like anhedonia,” says Laurel S. Morris, PhD, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine and first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By specifically targeting VTA activity and connectivity, ezogabine could open the door to decidedly improved outcomes for people who struggle daily with depression and anhedonia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, research revealed that ezogabine was able to normalize connectivity between the brain’s key reward regions and larger-scale brain networks including the posterior cingulate cortex, which plays a key role in internally directed thought and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who experienced greater improvement in their depression and anhedonia when treated with ezogabine showed decreased connectivity between brain reward regions and the cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these two complementary studies suggest that KCNQ channel openers can potentially alleviate the specific known neurobiological changes that occur in animal models of depression as well as change the function of larger brain networks that might be uniquely used in humans to regulate thought processes such as rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggested to us that drugs targeting the KCNQ channel may trigger antidepressant effects by reducing interactions between the reward centers in the brain and those related to negative thinking and emotion,” Dr. Murrough explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This hypothesis will require confirmation in larger clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Murrough is a named inventor on a pending patent application for the use of ezogabine and other KCNQ channel openers to treat depression and related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84e1e8edfee5e6e1f0ecaae0ebf3e8edeae3c4e9ebf1eaf0f7edeae5edaaebf6e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Dowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountsinai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elizabeth Dowling – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-02957-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of KCNQ potassium channel modulation on ventral tegmental area activity and connectivity in individuals with depression and anhedonia&lt;/a&gt;” by James Murrough et al. &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2025.02.897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial&lt;/a&gt;” by James Murrough et al. &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of KCNQ potassium channel modulation on ventral tegmental area activity and connectivity in individuals with depression and anhedonia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to half of individuals with depression do not respond to first-line treatments, possibly due to a lack of treatment interventions informed by neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A novel therapeutic approach for depression has recently emerged from translational work targeting aberrant activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons via modulation of the KCNQ voltage-gated potassium channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) with elevated anhedonia were randomized to five weeks of the KCNQ channel opener, ezogabine (up to 900 mg/day) or placebo. Participants completed functional MRI during a monetary anticipation task and resting-state at baseline and at end-of-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinical results were reported previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we examined VTA activity during monetary anticipation and resting-state functional connectivity between the VTA and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (mesocortical pathway) and ventral striatum (mesolimbic pathway) at baseline and end-of-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated a significant drug-by-time interaction in VTA activation during anticipation (F&lt;sub&gt;(1,34)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.36, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.044), where VTA activation was reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesocortical functional connectivity was also higher in depressed participants at baseline compared to a healthy control group (t&lt;sub&gt;(56)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.68, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and associated with VTA hyper-activity during task-based functional MRI at baseline (R = 0.352, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.033). Mesocortical connectivity was also reduced from pre-to-post ezogabine, compared to placebo (significant drug-by-time interaction, F&lt;sub&gt;(1,33)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.317, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.046).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together this translational work is consistent with preclinical findings highlighting VTA hyper-activity in depression, and suggesting a mechanism of action for KCNQ channel openers in normalizing this hyper-activity in individuals with both depression and anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effects of the KCNQ (Kv7) Channel Opener Ezogabine on Resting-State Functional Connectivity of Striatal Brain Reward Regions, Depression, and Anhedonia in Major Depressive Disorder: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, with available treatments often showing limited efficacy. Recent research suggests that targeting specific subtypes of depression and understanding the underlying brain mechanisms can improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the potential of the potassium KCNQ (Kv7) channel opener ezogabine to modulate the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the brain’s reward circuitry and alleviate depressive symptoms, including anhedonia, a core feature of MDD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in individuals with MDD ages 18 to 65 years compared daily dosing with ezogabine (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt; 19) with placebo (&lt;em&gt;n =&lt;/em&gt; 21) for 5 weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging assessed RSFC of the brain’s key reward regions (ventral caudate, nucleus accumbens) at baseline and posttreatment. Clinical symptoms were measured using the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and other clinical symptom scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezogabine significantly reduced RSFC between the reward seeds and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus compared with placebo, which was associated with a reduction in depression severity. Improvements in anhedonia (SHAPS) and depressive symptoms (MADRS) with ezogabine compared with placebo were also associated with decreased connectivity between the reward seeds and mid/posterior cingulate regions (midcingulate cortex, PCC, precuneus).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that ezogabine’s antidepressant effects are mediated through modulation of striatal–mid/posterior cingulate connectivity, indicating a potential therapeutic mechanism for KCNQ-targeted drugs for MDD and anhedonia. Future studies should validate these results in larger trials.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 12:57:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1fYmc2Nzc2UkRTYXpjLTdYN25rSDRBcGdBYklIYlpPWFM4VEdqbDVPejdDWHVRbkhsR2FkU19xMG5aMlZtYVdsUnI1RzVxU2dRRjB2Mng1UVhsbnJPZjcydXhDV0k1YWdHMWYzX0FaZENHX2VZdWRoNHR3OTdvVkk</guid></item><item><title>卫生官员报告道格拉斯发生汉坦病毒病例- The Record Courier | Health officials report hantavirus case in Douglas - The Record Courier</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOVUNoZm1HNlZyMjNxTEVhRDYxX3QzQXVRdmtZMkNSY29DdFgtWjJQYnZyaE14Zk5SNVpkTllNaGRvN3l3bnZ0OVdZdjZPcmJDcHhiTkg0b1VQNDJLc2hPQU1sYkx6alNjVVdCLTRPOUVYcjU2a0FWblR6RnRmeU9BaF9GTk43SW9VTklfbDNta3RBQ25UM051dFVfLUJTS2s?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_lead_photo"&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;The first Douglas County case of hantavirus in four years was reported by Carson City Health and Human Services on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A man under 50 years of age was hospitalized after inhaling or coming in contact with rodent droppings, urine, or nesting material disturbed during household renovations in the weeks prior to symptom development. The investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the fifth reported case of the virus in the eastern Sierra with a recent case in Washoe County and three fatalities in Mammoth Lakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one-third of people with Hantavirus infections die, according to Mono County Public Health Officer Dr. Tom Boo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The occurrence of three cases in a short period has me worried, especially this early in the year,” he said in April in the announcement of the third death. “Historically, we tend to see Hantavirus cases later in the spring and in the summer. We believe that deer mouse numbers are high this year in Mammoth (and probably elsewhere in the Eastern Sierra). An increase in indoor mice elevates the risk of hantavirus exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1730490821564-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Mammoth deaths don’t appear to be related to the usual activities associated with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, none of these deceased individuals engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste,” Boo said. “Instead, these folks may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace. Many of us encounter deer mice in our daily lives and there is some risk. We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mono County has recorded 27 cases since it was first reported here in 1993, the most in the State of California. Twenty-one of these infections affected county residents, and six occurred in visitors who were infected in Mono.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People get infected with Hantavirus through contact with the feces, urine, or saliva of infected deer mice,” Boo said. “Most often this happens by inhaling contaminated particles in the air, although getting waste in your mouth from contaminated hands can cause infection too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period after infection is usually two or three weeks but can range from one to more than seven weeks, after which illness typically begins as a nonspecific flu-like illness with fever, headache and body aches, also often with gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and occasionally abdominal pain. These early symptoms are usually not mild. Muscle aches, for example, are often severe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1730489846745-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Typically, there is no cough in this early phase, and the presence of cough, runny nose or sore throat in the first day or two points more to common respiratory viruses such as flu or COVID,” Boo said. “Hantavirus often, though not always, progresses to involve the lungs after a few days, at which time a cough develops.

Unlike traditional CRISPR tools that edit DNA, this system repurposes CRISPR-Cas13 to act like a “mailman,” carrying RNA to damaged sites using built-in molecular zip codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, the technique, called CRISPR-TO, boosted neurite growth by up to 50% in just 24 hours, marking a major step forward in spatial RNA medicine. This breakthrough may enable safer, more effective RNA-based treatments for conditions like ALS, spinal cord injuries, and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR-TO System:&lt;/strong&gt; Cas13 delivers RNA to precise neural sites using molecular zip codes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Regrowth:&lt;/strong&gt; Promoted 50% greater neurite growth in injured neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Class of Medicine:&lt;/strong&gt; Introduces “spatial RNA medicine” for targeted cellular repair.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a neuron in our body gets damaged, segments of RNA produce proteins that can help repair the injury. But in neurological disorders such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy, or following spinal cord injuries, the mechanisms for moving life-essential RNA to injured sites within the cell fail. As a result, RNA molecules can’t get to where they are needed and damage becomes permanent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Stanford have developed a technology for transporting RNA to specific locations within a neuron, where it can repair and even regrow parts of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110257"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/CRISPR-neural-repair-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn’t want to make any changes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work, supported by the National Institutes of Health, forms the foundation for a new class of therapeutics that the researchers are calling “spatial RNA medicine,” which they hope will lead to treatments for neurological diseases as well as traumatic injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we’ve harnessed the power of CRISPR technology to create a precise spatial ‘zip code’ that delivers RNA molecules exactly where they’re needed within cells,” said Stanley Qi, an associate professor of bioengineering and senior author on the paper published May 21 in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine being able to specifically target damaged sites within a neuron, repairing them, and promoting their regrowth – this is what our technology achieves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A CRISPR-based mailman&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have realized that the distribution of RNA within a cell – where specific molecules are located – may be just as important as what they are capable of doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual neuron can be over a meter long, and aging, injury, and mutations can all disrupt its ability to transport the tiny RNA over such a distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Therapeutic RNA can’t help if it doesn’t get to where it’s needed,” Qi said. “We wanted to create a technology that could reliably move RNA to where it needs to function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi and his colleagues used a version of the gene-editing tool CRISPR, called CRISPR-Cas13, to target individual pieces of RNA (unlike the more widely known CRISPR-Cas9, which targets DNA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, CRISPR is used to slice and edit genetic code, but in this case the researchers didn’t want to make any changes. They simply wanted to move the existing RNA to a new place within the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cas13 naturally acts like a pair of scissors, but we engineered it to act like a mailman instead,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then we can tell it to carry the RNA from one precise location to another.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers paired Cas13 with specific localization signals that act as addresses, instructing the Cas13 where to deliver the RNA. Each location within the cell has its own address molecule, so the researchers can direct the RNA to various locations by adding different molecules to the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi and his colleagues used their technology, which they are calling CRISPR-TO, to screen dozens of pieces of RNA and see if any of them would help neurons to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They added CRISPR-TO to mouse brain neurons in a petri dish, where it carried the RNA molecules to the tips of neurites – fingerlike protrusions that form synapses and connect to other neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found several promising candidates, including one RNA molecule that increased neurite growth by as much as 50% over a 24-hour period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are discovering more RNA targets that could promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration,” said Mengting Han, a postdoctoral scholar in Qi’s lab and lead author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve added a new tool to the CRISPR toolbox, using it to control RNA localization inside the cell. This has never been achieved before and, importantly, it opens new therapeutic directions for treating neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Safer, more effective RNA medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are using CRISPR-TO to screen additional RNA molecules to determine which ones will be most effective at repairing injured neurons in the brains of mice, as well as in human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are at the beginning of understanding how spatial organization of RNA benefits brain repair,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope our technology will help people figure out which RNAs will be the biggest players for better therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the researchers are using CRISPR-TO to move endogenous RNAs – RNA molecules that are naturally produced within the cell. But it could also be used to provide precise control over RNA-based medicines, making them both safer and more efficient, Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This potential excites us tremendously,” Qi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not enough for a molecule to just be in the cell. We need it to be in the right location at the right time. With our precise, programmable technology, you can target any RNA in any type of cell and bring it to the site of need in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Center for Research Resources, the Stanford School of Medicine Dean’s Postdoctoral Fellowship, and the American Heart Association Postdoctoral Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this CRISPR and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0f6c6763606a6b66604f7c7b6e6169607d6b216a6b7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chloe Dionisio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Chloe Dionisio – Stanford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09041-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing&lt;/a&gt;” by Stanley Qi et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clonal tracing with somatic epimutations reveals dynamics of blood ageing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current approaches used to track stem cell clones through differentiation require genetic engineering or rely on sparse somatic DNA variants, which limits their wide application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we discover that DNA methylation of a subset of CpG sites reflects cellular differentiation, whereas another subset undergoes stochastic epimutations and can serve as digital barcodes of clonal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate that targeted single-cell profiling of DNA methylation at single-CpG resolution can accurately extract both layers of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, we develop EPI-Clone, a method for transgene-free lineage tracing at scale. Applied to mouse and human haematopoiesis, we capture hundreds of clonal differentiation trajectories across tens of individuals and 230,358 single cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse ageing, we demonstrate that myeloid bias and low output of old haematopoietic stem cells are restricted to a small number of expanded clones, whereas many functionally young-like clones persist in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In human ageing, clones with and without known driver mutations of clonal haematopoieis are part of a spectrum of age-related clonal expansions that display similar lineage biases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPI-Clone enables accurate and transgene-free single-cell lineage tracing on hematopoietic cell state landscapes at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikq0v00293576hpqcm3bd@published"&gt;My mother grew up in a very Catholic family. So Catholic that my uncle joined the seminary right out of high school. He became a priest, but is able to make visits to see the family from time to time. We always have a big gathering where everyone gets together for Father’s Day, and this year, he will be able to make it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikq2r002c3576w54vaexa@published"&gt;The thing is, my ex-husband and I have gotten divorced since the last time we saw my uncle. My mom begged me not to say anything to him about it, and I foolishly agreed. Big mistake. Now my mom wants me and my ex to pretend to still be married when we both attend the family gathering on Father’s Day, because she thinks it would crush my uncle to learn of our divorce. Is she asking too much, or should we just fake it for one afternoon?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqbm002h3576v7gzfxo9@published"&gt;I too grew up in a Catholic family and seem to recall hearing a lot about how wrong it is to lie? Religion aside, your mother shouldn’t be demanding that you do so. Her request is less about holiness and more about saving face. Which feels rather misguided, since it’s not as though your uncle is unaware of the existence of divorce—and if by some chance he decides to take yours personally, that is definitely his problem, not yours. Neither you nor your ex should go along with your mother’s ruse if you don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqdo002i3576gsaq7ilb@published"&gt;Her demand does make me wonder if perhaps &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is the one who hasn’t fully adjusted to the fact of your divorce. There may not be much for you to do about that, even if it’s true, and it’s not as if you need any family member’s approval to do what’s right for you. I only point this out because &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; your mother isn’t entirely okay with your situation, that has the potential to have a greater impact on your life than whatever your uncle—who you don’t see very often—might think about it. If you think that might be the case, you can decide whether a more pointed conversation with your mom is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqq2002l35767cdipomw@published"&gt;My husband “Grant” has a 6-year-old daughter, “Charity,” from his previous marriage. The custody arrangement he has with his ex is such where she alternates spending 10-day stretches with her mother and with us. Charity is a very easygoing, fun kid to be around and we get along well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="177" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqs6002m3576bcmqyb7h@published"&gt;The problem is that Grant refuses to engage in any kind of sexual activity with me while his daughter is at our place. He claims that he is uncomfortable doing anything because he is afraid of the possibility she will hear it or walk in on us and report it to his ex, who is an extremely petty and vindictive person.&lt;br&gt;Before the current custody agreement was hammered out, she frequently thwarted Grant’s efforts to spend time with Charity, and my husband says he “doesn’t want to give her any potential ammo.” Charity’s bedroom is all the way down the hall, so I very much doubt she will hear anything. I have suggested locking the door in case she tries to come in. Grant is against that because she sometimes has nightmares and will come running to jump in bed with us. I want very much for us to have children of our own, and at this rate I don’t see how it will happen. What can I do to convince my husband how irrational his fears are?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikqyf002p3576ipchs6mm@published"&gt;You have already presented Grant with a very simple, sensible solution—locking your bedroom door—and he still isn’t willing. Could there be something else, apart from his daughter’s presence, that has him feeling reluctant? Is he perhaps less certain than you are about having a child, or might there currently be a mismatch in your libidos? I’m not trying to make any assumptions, but whether it’s merely the anxiety over his child or something else, your sex life is important and he should be willing to try to figure this out with you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikr0d002q3576zqfsew6i@published"&gt;People manage to have sex despite young kids being in the house all the time. If Charity had a nightmare and needed you, it’s not hard to yell “just a second!”, throw some clothes on, and go unlock the door. I imagine you’ve also told Grant that you can be quieter on nights when she is staying with you. Even if his ex is looking for reasons to punish him, I doubt she’s living under the illusion that you two &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; sleep together. (Also, I am not a lawyer, but I don’t think you can throw out a whole custody agreement because a child happens to do what many kids have done since time immemorial and walked in on their parents having sex. Which, again, does not &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to happen, because as you have pointed out, you can just lock the door!)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikr2b002r35762rz1zuks@published"&gt;If both you and Grant were fine with your 10-days-on, 10-days-off routine, that would be one thing—but you’re not. So I think it’s worth talking with him about this hang-up and why he’s been so hesitant. Be as kind and patient as you can be, but be honest, too, and let him know that you aren’t happy with the total lack of intimacy when Charity is in the house and would like it to change. You two might also consider talking with a competent sex therapist who can help you address whatever may be going on.&lt;/p&gt;

She said she hoped that my family was feeling better, because my sister had told everyone we weren’t present because we had the flu. When I called my sister and demanded an explanation, she said that while she loves us and doesn’t mind spending individual time with Annie, she “didn’t want the distraction” at her child’s christening. I told her that we would spare her and the rest of the family the trouble, because we weren’t going to bother with any future invitations. My parents and my brother have all been saying the same thing: They love Annie, but don’t want events “ruined” or “disrupted” and that “it can’t be all about your daughter.”&lt;/p&gt;

She has MS and is increasingly unable to care for herself. A few days ago, I learned that a position in my company has become available in the state where she lives. Susan adores Annie and they are very close (they FaceTime every few days). Annie does have friends here and a good but not great support system at school. My husband is a freelance writer, so a move would not be disruptive for his career. Given my MIL’s growing need for help and the way my family continues to ostracize Annie, is requesting a transfer the right thing to do?&lt;/p&gt;

I did wonder whether you were thinking about this move in part to avoid doing so—as if your family members could just be out of sight, out of mind—but wherever you live, you will still have to deal with your feelings over how they’ve treated your daughter, and you’ll still have to decide whether or not to continue having a relationship with them.&lt;/p&gt;

It could be that further conversations with your family would help them better understand Annie, and how hurtful it is when they fail to include her. But I know that would be difficult labor on your part, and you might not be all that motivated to undertake it, especially when you don’t know that they will ever come around. Whatever you wind up choosing where your relatives are concerned, I hope that you and Annie continue to find meaningful friendships and community—the kind of love and support you deserve, even if your family refuses to provide it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmayikrts00333576cvnvu6nt@published"&gt;Approximately a month ago I hired a young man from a pet store I frequent to housesit for a day. His prices were outrageous, but I agreed since my regular housesitter was out of town. He changed $100 per trip to my house which was required two times a day so he expected $200 for a whole day. For the record I have never been charged that much. I am disabled and about three days before I was supposed to leave I became quite ill and decided to cancel by text. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/12/parenting-mulligans-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;He told me he charged a cancellation fee…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those struggling to get more healthy foods into their diet Dr Nye recommended opting for frozen options that can be easily added to a variety of meals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Frozen fruit and vegetables can be just as beneficial and often easier to add to meals to get that content in’, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another tip for a longer life offered by Dr Nye was to ensure you get the recommend seven to eight hours of sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Shorter than seven hours of sleep daily is linked to a 12 per cent increased risk of death, with those who sleep over eight hours being linked to a 30 per cent increased chance,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It seems that having regular sleep patterns may be the key to getting the most benefit and potentially living longer’, the expert added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that prolonged sleep deficiency can put people at a higher risk for conditions like obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nye's final tip, knowing your family history for any conditions you should keep track of as well as attending routine health checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the doctor, genetic factors, including disease risk, hormone balance and cell replacement rates, are believed to influence between 20 and 30 per cent of your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘About 40 per cent of life expectancy is inherited among generations, meaning you are more likely to live longer if your parents and grandparents did,’ he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genetic testing, sometimes called genomic testing—which highlights changes in genes that can cause health problems—is mainly used to diagnose rare and inherited health conditions and some cancers. It can also help couples understand the risk of passing on a health condition to their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the NHS advises considering how the results could affect you and others in your family, as there is a chance that the test will provide information about your relatives that was not previously known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nye's advice comes as data suggests England' bulging waistlines have caused a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14409773/England-life-expectancy-rankings-calculator-long-live.html"&gt;significant drop in average life expectancy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After decades of progress, attempts to keep people living longer are beginning to fail, with people in England now living roughly nine months less than they did in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Separate data released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this year suggested that a baby boy born in the UK in 2023 could expect to live on average to 86.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Girls still have a longer anticipated lifespan of 90 years, although the gap has been narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of the latest ONS data, for 2023, there are just over 16,000 centenarians—people who have lived over 100 years—living in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

When combined in a balanced breakfast, this trio works together to keep your energy, focus, and mood steady from morning to night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Aim to eat within one to two hours of waking to &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-that-boost-metabolism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:support metabolism and energy levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;support metabolism and energy levels&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day,” says Jordan Hill, MCD, RD, CSSD, registered dietitian and certified specialist in sports dietetics. “If you’re someone who doesn’t feel hungry upon waking, start with something small and build up to a full breakfast. &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/is-it-ok-to-skip-breakfast-11693292" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Skipping meals in general;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Skipping meals in general&lt;/a&gt; can lead to low energy and overeating or cravings later in the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Smoothies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While smoothies are, in theory, a nutritious way to start the day, if you forget key nutrients, you may be feeling tired and hungry just a couple hours later,” says Kaytee Hadley, MS, RDN, IFMCP, functional medicine dietitian and founder of Holistic Health and Wellness. “I recommend including fruit, veggies, nuts or seeds, and a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-sources-of-protein-8775868" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:concentrated source of protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;concentrated source of protein&lt;/a&gt; from a powder, tofu, or milk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re someone who loves a fruit-only smoothie, she suggests enjoying it after a balanced meal rather than relying on it as a stand-alone breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Flavored Yogurt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though a convenient grab-and-go breakfast option, many flavored yogurts are sneakily packed with added sugar. In fact, Amy Davis, RDN, nutrition consultant at Live Conscious, notes that some varieties can contain up to 18 grams in just one serving. “This surge of sugar first thing in the morning without much protein won’t keep individuals full for long, and will likely lead to a dip in energy by mid-morning, plus cravings for more quick-absorbing, sugary carbs.” Instead, try plain Greek yogurt with berries, chia seeds, and a drizzle of nut butter. “This Greek yogurt parfait is a perfectly balanced breakfast of &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/greek-yogurt-health-benefits-7182253" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein from Greek yogurt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;protein from Greek yogurt&lt;/a&gt;, plus some &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/probiotic-foods-7643548" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:probiotics for gut health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;probiotics for gut health&lt;/a&gt;, berries for antioxidants and fiber, chia seeds for more filling fiber, and &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-nut-butter-at-the-supermarket-11681547" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nut butter for satiating healthy fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;nut butter for satiating healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/healthy-yogurt-brands" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Is the Healthiest Yogurt?

RDs Share Their Top Picks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Coffee Creamer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You might want to rethink that generous splash of creamer in your morning coffee, especially if it’s the first thing hitting your stomach. “Drinking concentrated amounts of sugar on an empty stomach, or without enough fiber or protein to balance it out, can lead to a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-that-make-you-tired-8738277" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sugar crash and zap your energy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;sugar crash and zap your energy&lt;/a&gt; shortly after,” says Hadley. And it’s not just the sugar that can mess with your energy over time. “While saturated fat doesn’t have an immediate effect on blood sugar or energy, too much can lead to the development of insulin resistance and make it more difficult for your body to handle it in the future,” she says. The good news is you don’t have to give up your coffee routine. Just look for creamers that are lower in sugar and saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Pancakes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pancakes might be a breakfast staple, but the typical stack is made with white refined flour and drenched in sugary syrup, racking up around 40 grams of added sugar with barely any fiber or protein. “The large amount of sugar will trigger a quick rise in blood sugar, followed by the release of insulin, causing blood sugar to drop back down relatively quickly,” says Davis. This mid-morning slump can leave you feeling sluggish, irritable, and reaching for another snack not long after. Instead, make the meal more balanced by enjoying one pancake alongside a couple of eggs and sliced tomatoes, or make a homemade version with smarter ingredients like rolled oats, eggs, collagen, mashed banana, and a splash of vanilla extract for more fiber, B vitamins, and protein content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Instant Oatmeal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Oatmeal on its own can fall short of the key nutrients needed to keep you full and energized. A typical packet of instant oats clocks in at around 33 grams of carbs and 12 grams of added sugar, but only offers about 4 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber. “This breakfast will likely be quickly absorbed and digested, and lead to some short-term energy, but leave you feeling hungry just an hour or two later,” says Davis. To level up your bowl, try adding functional boosters like a scoop of protein powder, fresh berries, chia seeds, and a drizzle of nut butter. These simple additions pack in protein, antioxidants, vitamin C, fiber, and healthy fats to help you stay full and fueled for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;White Bread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Made from refined flour and stripped of key vitamins, minerals, and fiber that support better blood sugar control, white bread breaks down into sugar quickly once it hits your bloodstream. And without any protein, fiber, or fat to balance it out, you’ll be reaching for another quick fix in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Ideally, most of the grain-based foods consumed should be whole grains,” says Davis. For a more energizing alternative, she suggests swapping in a slice of &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/sprouted-grain-bread" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sprouted whole grain bread;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;sprouted whole grain bread&lt;/a&gt; and topping it with nut butter and berries or avocado and eggs. This simple switch loads your breakfast with protein, fat, and fiber, helping to slow digestion and give you a more sustained, steady energy boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sugary Breakfast Cereals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Sugary breakfast cereals tend to be low in both protein and fiber, two nutrients known to increase satiety and mitigate blood sugar spikes,” says Hill. “Without adequate protein or fiber in the meal, the sugary breakfast cereal may provide a burst of energy, but result in an energy crash later.” Though they may be tempting, Hill suggests treating sugary breakfast cereals like a treat rather than a meal option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-cereals-at-supermarket-8776611" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The 7 Healthiest Cereals You Can Find at the Supermarket, According to Registered Dietitians;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The 7 Healthiest Cereals You Can Find at the Supermarket, According to Registered Dietitians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Pastries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Typically packed with refined flours, sugar, and oils or butter high in saturated fat, pastries like croissants, donuts, and muffins can leave you dragging not long after eating them. “Sugar and saturated fat can cause inflammation in the body, making one feel sluggish and tired,” says Hill. And if they’re a regular part of your morning routine, the saturated fat may start to impact your cholesterol levels over time. Instead, try &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/browse-all-recipes/pomegranate-almond-toast-recipe" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole grain toast topped with nut butter and fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;whole grain toast topped with nut butter and fruit&lt;/a&gt;, a still-sweet option that Hill says offers fiber and natural sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Processed Meat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Processed meats like bacon and sausage are often loaded with sodium and saturated fat, both of which can cause inflammation. “The higher fat content can delay our digestion and absorption of the meal, making us feel sluggish and low energy,” says Hill. “Sodium in particular, if eaten in high amounts, can negatively impact blood pressure over time or make someone retain water and feel bloated.” That said, the occasional crispy slice of bacon isn’t off the table, especially if it’s part of an otherwise balanced diet. Consider swapping in turkey bacon or veggie sausages instead. “While these may still be high in sodium, they are likely lower in overall fat and saturated fat content,” Hill adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/breakfast-foods-that-make-you-feel-sluggish-11739513" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Real Simple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Real Simple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 10:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxObncySEhiTjlrSk1LaHU3TGJGWS11MGhadThIR3Q1OFM2ZGFzQUhDZHVKYjlGemdoMEd1N1p3dmtDV2gxbjR3ZkstWVQ4NkJXUTQwcDlFWFNyU2V4UDl5bGNOX0lVSm5zRUw1RElpc1RWdWhhNGJKYWZWU0hnbjAyWnlCYw</guid></item><item><title>整容手术比以往任何时候都更容易获得，禁忌也更少。年轻的女性也会一起去兜风。-雅虎 | Cosmetic procedures are more accessible — and less taboo — than ever before.

"I started to notice some changes in my skin, like more prominent lines on my forehead and crow's feet," she says. "I also wanted slightly fuller-looking lips but nothing unnatural."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sarah, who asked not to use her last name, watched TikTok videos to learn more about how injectables work and read reviews of med spas and cosmetic clinics in her area, a suburb outside of New York City. Doing so left her feeling better informed and able to advocate for herself and what she wanted (and didn't want).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Overall, I was really happy with my experience," Sarah says. "It looked subtle but noticeable enough to me and really boosted my confidence." Now 33, Sarah gets Botox once or twice a year and lip filler every 12 to 15 months ("as far as invasive procedures go, I'd never say never," she adds).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She also appears to be in it for the long haul. "There's so much pressure on women to stay looking young and beautiful, not to mention that social media makes it hard not to compare yourself to others," says Sarah. "I'm a confident person, but if I can afford to remain looking as young as I feel in my 40s and 50s, I wouldn't rule that out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But it's women who are &lt;em&gt;currently &lt;/em&gt;in their 40s and 50s who are less inclined to get an injectable or go under the knife. Sarah represents part of a generational shift in how women of different ages view beauty and cosmetic procedures. Today young women are &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISe_4mnk_o" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:documenting their nose jobs;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;documenting their nose jobs&lt;/a&gt; on social media while Gen Z and millennial influencers get transparent about what&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzYkwPoLRk0&amp;amp;pp=0gcJCfcAhR29_xXO" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:work they've had done;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt; work they've had done&lt;/a&gt;. And according to a survey of 1,677 U.S. adults conducted by Yahoo News and YouGov in late March, 34% of women ages 18 to 39 would consider getting a cosmetic procedure, compared with 20% of women over 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This raises the question: &lt;em&gt;Why?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Two decades ago, cosmetic procedures were often associated with vanity, secrecy or wealth —something to be hidden or denied,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.linplasticsurgery.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Samuel Lin;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Samuel Lin&lt;/a&gt;, a plastic surgeon and associate professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School, tells Yahoo Life. “Today that stigma has eroded due to increased openness, media representation and an evolving definition of beauty that emphasizes empowerment and choice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In other words, there's a lot at play here. Women didn’t become more accepting and open about aesthetic treatments overnight. Like most ideological shifts, it happened slowly over time as a response to changes in society, technology, accessibility and increased education and transparency around a topic that was once considered taboo to talk about. Here's how we got here — and what experts and young women think about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="social-medias-role"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media’s role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If it weren’t for the rise of apps like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat, we might not be having this discussion. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/unpacking-tiktok-controversial-bold-glamour-filter-175924840.html" data-ylk="slk:Skin-perfecting filters;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Skin-perfecting filters&lt;/a&gt; aside, we’ve also witnessed more and more creators getting candid about their experiences with cosmetic treatments, which over time has worked to normalize the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Platforms like Instagram and TikTok have not only normalized but glamorized aesthetic enhancements,” confirms Lin. “Influencers and celebrities openly sharing their experiences with Botox,&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/amy-schumer-fillers-dissolved-192108717.html" data-ylk="slk:filler;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;

in New York City, believes this transparency has led to younger generations breaking the pattern of being so competitive with one another. “It’s an anti-gatekeeping mentality that makes things like injectables and lasers more socially acceptable,” she says. “We’re less judgmental now, and people feel more free to do what they want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This newfound openness has also contributed to increased education about these procedures. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DH6MALBRYDj/?igsh=NTY2NW9zZnBmMzQ2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Patients;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Patients&lt;/a&gt;

For one, getting work done no longer feels quite so out of reach. It's not just for the rich and famous, but for the girl next door too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"You don’t have to go to New York or L.A. to get work done anymore; now even in small towns you can likely find someone to do lip filler," Coleman notes, pointing to the rise of suburban med spas offering injectables. The prices also feel "more accessible," Coleman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lin agrees. "Minimally invasive procedures with little downtime are now widely available and more affordable than in the past," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cosmetic dermatologist &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.instagram.com/drtkeaney/?hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Terrence Keaney;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Terrence Keaney&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="link " href="https://skindcderm.com/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAafu3YwvngiFZHJkzb1CkgnHilylkDPxNr8ZgXJh-jg_3OUEwrmGlJ02vGIXyw_aem_ylav8gAFkPJOrtzxrNHVEg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SkinDC;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;SkinDC&lt;/a&gt;, adds that the industry has made considerable gains in the more than two decades since Botox was first FDA-approved for cosmetic use, in 2002, paving the way for more aesthetic treatments. “This has slowly normalized these procedures, opening up the cosmetic market beyond the traditional patient, which used to be women ages 35 to 55," he tells Yahoo Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then there are advancements in technology and technique, which have made treatments more appealing and less alarming to consumers. “Our knowledge and techniques continue to get better, safer," says Molina. 'Time and experience [are] on our side now. This has led to more natural and favorable results and better nonsurgical treatments that are safer and more effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How social media, the med spa boom and other factors have given rise to increased interest in injectables and more invasive procedures.

Now self-care has evolved into something bigger as folks grow more focused on longevity and maintaining their youthfulness for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Millennials and Gen Z see cosmetic work as routine self-care or maintenance, akin to getting facials or fitness training.” Lin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Dr. Usha Rajagopal, a plastic surgeon and medical director of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.sfcosmeticsurgery.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:San Francisco Plastic Surgery and Laser Center;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;San Francisco Plastic Surgery and Laser Center&lt;/a&gt;, younger adults are more inclined to view these treatments not as superficial but as part of a broader commitment to self-improvement and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The younger generation prioritizes life experiences and self-care over traditional measures of success like big houses or luxury cars,” Rajaopal tells Yahoo Life. “They’re seeking ways to enhance their well-being and personal happiness, and as this mindset evolves, so does their perception of cosmetic procedures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This shift, she adds, "reflects a new cultural approach to beauty, where cosmetic enhancements are seen as tools for empowerment, confidence and self-expression."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But neuropsychologist Sanam Hafeez, director of &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="http://www.comprehendthemind.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Comprehend the Mind;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Comprehend the Mind&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t believe it’s so cut-and-dried. “Although aesthetic treatments can represent empowerment and self-care for younger women, we must acknowledge the societal pressures influencing their choices,” Hafeez cautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That includes selfies, social media and Zoom meetings.”The demand to maintain a polished and youthful appearance for camera-based interactions has become especially intense because screens mediate both their social engagements and professional responsibilities," Hafeez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="is-this-shift-good-or-bad"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this shift good or bad?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That's not so easy to answer; it's a nuanced issue with both pros and cons, depending on your perspective. Many see the transparency around it as a positive. Hafeez points out, however, that this growing acceptance of cosmetic surgery, and the comparison culture underpinning it, may convince some women — not just young ones — that they're not enough as they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The current environment becomes complicated because it involves personal choice alongside societal expectations,” says Hafeez. “The choice to undergo cosmetic procedures does not happen in isolation, because cultural influences and peer pressure, combined with modern beauty ideals, drive the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lin agrees that while normalizing the conversation and reducing stigma is a positive step toward bodily autonomy, the increased pressure to conform is definitely a downside. “Cosmetic procedures can boost confidence, improve quality of life and help individuals align their outer appearance with how they feel inside,” he says. “But when filters and enhancements become the norm, young people may internalize unrealistic expectations, leading to body-image issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But for Jenna Berube, a 31-year-old copywriter in New Hampshire, seeing women her age embrace treatments like Botox and fillers isn't shameful ... it just&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think for younger women, cosmetic procedures just feel more part of the conversation now because we talk about it so much more openly, especially on social media, so it doesn’t feel taboo or like something to be ashamed of,” Berube tells Yahoo Life. “It’s really become just about doing what will make you feel good in your own skin — no judgment either way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 10:30:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9gFBVV95cUxNc055NVhINnF5ak5hQUNHRGpUNjFHMmFrSmJfU0hFaEFNdWs5d3puQ1YySHZDU2l4cFpuVFN6MEZuenpmVnFjV2NqRFdwNkhwT3dXenVLVkgxT2o4RWRnWTVmMXFsWE1ZalMwbG5EOEFUWkRMSldWMjFVMmVkNlY0LTZqSFpJMXNtTE5RWHZwSVdQQ3k2WnVuQ3dQODkzakZhdWRaVzQyYU5faTU0eUctbS1kcEx6QWFieGlBMUtSTWN5T2txejNKaXRvMWhQazdMeXV6SThDQ3AtUEVvdG5FMUhfd1VaaTMzeFNRRWMzVFFNRWdNaEE</guid></item><item><title>Adjaye Associates设计加纳国际儿童癌症研究中心- ArchDaily | Adjaye Associates Designs International Children’s Cancer Research Centre in Ghana - ArchDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNS2NseWx3QzFzVEhENFdrWkdDY0ppZnVteVc1R1o0NnctWDNNUWs4MTRLb2ZXNnhIWDFlUjJxTGJFMi1rMmJkZGFIRXpJUDg3NUlSaTVrdzc3WjY3anh2cW9KTmZ3MWp3Tnp1aklEX21UaTdVN0pPVU9Pa0ZsLVdtRTNjb2JnNTRDNVdwLVpac2xRc2RjQy1za3RsODBuRlo2OFhxd0ZSR1dXcjFLNjE1c1I2QWkzZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="afd-post-content" data-io-article-url="https://www.archdaily.com/1030379/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana" id="single-content"&gt;&lt;figure aria-labelledby="figcaption_newsroom-picture-att-id-682ee54282d8260188bcd294" class="featured-image js-image-size media-picture" id="newsroom-picture-att-id-682ee54282d8260188bcd294"&gt;&lt;a class="js-image-size__link " href="/1030379/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana/682ee54282d8260188bcd294-adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana-photo" rel="attachment"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 768px)" srcset="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/682e/e542/82d8/2601/88bc/d294/medium_jpg/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-kyebi-ghana_2.jpg?1747903830"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adjaye Associates Designs International Children’s Cancer Research Centre in Ghana - Image 1 of 12" data-nr-picture-id="682ee54282d8260188bcd294" fetchpriority="high" itemprop="image" loading="eager" longdesc="https://www.archdaily.com/1030379/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana/682ee54282d8260188bcd294-adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana-photo" src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/682e/e542/82d8/2601/88bc/d294/newsletter/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-kyebi-ghana_2.jpg?1747903830"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figcaption afd-desktop-e" id="figcaption_newsroom-picture-att-id-682ee54282d8260188bcd294"&gt;ICCR Ghana Render.

Programmatically, the ICCRC will include a children's &lt;a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/hospital"&gt;hospital&lt;/a&gt;, advanced research laboratories, a training institute for oncology, family and staff housing, a &lt;a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/chapel"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and a dedicated support centre for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure aria-labelledby="682ee5369f99780187839117" class="js-image-size media-picture"&gt;&lt;a class="js-image-size__link lazy-anchor" href="/1030379/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana/682ee5369f99780187839117-adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana-photo"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/682e/e536/9f99/7801/8783/9117/medium_jpg/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-kyebi-ghana_13.jpg?1747903809"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adjaye Associates Designs International Children’s Cancer Research Centre in Ghana - Image 3 of 12" data-nr-picture-id="682ee5369f99780187839117" itemprop="image" loading="lazy" longdesc="https://www.archdaily.com/1030379/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana/682ee5369f99780187839117-adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana-photo" src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/682e/e536/9f99/7801/8783/9117/newsletter/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-kyebi-ghana_13.jpg?1747903809"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figcaption afd-desktop-e" id="682ee5369f99780187839117"&gt;ICCR Ghana Render.

I have always sought to work out the aesthetics of this inquiry in my work. At its best, architecture should contribute to a social change agenda. - Sir David Adjaye&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="rel-article__hr"&gt;  &lt;hr class="rel-article__hr"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The design concept draws on the Akan worldview, which understands illness as a disruption of individual, social, and environmental balance. In response, the ICCRC master plan integrates biophilic design principles, embedding built structures into the surrounding forested terrain. The entry sequence begins at a low-level earthen Welcome Centre that initiates a sensory shift from the outside world into a calm, care-focused environment. Across the campus, shaded courtyards and vibrant gardens introduce light, air, and moments of pause, an intentional contrast to the sterile atmospheres typical of conventional hospitals. Sustainable design principles are also embedded throughout the project. Passive cooling strategies, site-specific building orientation, and &lt;a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/photovoltaic"&gt;photovoltaic energy &lt;/a&gt;systems contribute to reducing operational energy demands. The approach integrates traditional environmental knowledge with contemporary building technologies, aligning the campus design with its climatic and cultural context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure aria-labelledby="682ee5409f9978018783911c" class="js-image-size media-picture"&gt;&lt;a class="js-image-size__link lazy-anchor" href="/1030379/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana/682ee5409f9978018783911c-adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana-photo"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/682e/e540/9f99/7801/8783/911c/medium_jpg/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-kyebi-ghana_4.jpg?1747903830"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adjaye Associates Designs International Children’s Cancer Research Centre in Ghana - Image 4 of 12" data-nr-picture-id="682ee5409f9978018783911c" itemprop="image" loading="lazy" longdesc="https://www.archdaily.com/1030379/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana/682ee5409f9978018783911c-adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-ghana-photo" src="https://images.adsttc.com/media/images/682e/e540/9f99/7801/8783/911c/newsletter/adjaye-associates-designs-international-childrens-cancer-research-centre-in-kyebi-ghana_4.jpg?1747903830"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="figcaption afd-desktop-e" id="682ee5409f9978018783911c"&gt;ICCR Ghana Render.

These spaces are at once social and sacred, grounding the hospital's rhythm in moments of reflection and connection. Architecturally, the campus is shaped by local materials and construction methods. &lt;a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/rammed-earth/page/1"&gt;Rammed earth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/clay"&gt;clay&lt;/a&gt; brickwork, &lt;a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/timber"&gt;timber&lt;/a&gt;, and composite earth slabs are used throughout, offering tactile warmth and cultural familiarity. Staff and family residences are positioned low within the landscape, maintaining a sense of intimacy and continuity with the terrain.

In a series of experiments using animal models and human genetic data, researchers found that amlodipine reduced hyperactivity and impulsivity—key features of ADHD—while also demonstrating potential advantages over current stimulant medications. The findings suggest that this well-tolerated drug could serve as a foundation for a new type of non-stimulant treatment for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental condition that typically emerges in childhood and can persist into adulthood. It is characterized by persistent symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily life, academic achievement, work performance, and social relationships. ADHD affects an estimated 2 to 5 percent of the global population and is associated with a higher risk of other mental health problems, including mood and anxiety disorders, substance use, and even suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments for ADHD typically involve stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamines. These drugs can be effective for many people, but they are also associated with several drawbacks. Side effects like insomnia, appetite loss, headaches, and increased blood pressure are common. There is also a potential for misuse, especially in adolescents and young adults. Importantly, about 25 percent of individuals with ADHD do not experience adequate symptom relief from any available medication. These limitations have driven researchers to explore new therapeutic options that are both effective and better tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at 3Z Pharmaceuticals in Iceland sought to identify a non-stimulant medication that could offer an alternative for individuals who do not respond well to existing treatments. They focused on amlodipine, a widely used drug for treating high blood pressure, because it targets L-type calcium channels—proteins in the brain that help regulate electrical activity in neurons and are increasingly recognized as playing a role in neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hypothesized that modulating these calcium channels could help alleviate the symptoms of ADHD. Their goal was to determine whether amlodipine, which already has a strong safety record, could be repurposed as a novel treatment for the disorder. Their strategy was to integrate findings across multiple experimental systems—including behavioral testing in rats and zebrafish, pharmacological and brain imaging studies, and human genetic analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At 3Z, we developed a high-throughput behavioral screening platform for drug discovery, using genetically engineered zebrafish models,” explained corresponding author Karl Ægir Karlsson, the CEO of 3Z and a professor of neuroscience at Reykjavik University. “The platform is built to detect therapeutic effects across a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders with a behavioral phenotype. ADHD was a natural fit: it’s highly prevalent, current medications have significant limitations — including adverse effects and a large non-responder group — and there’s a clear need for novel therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Crucially, we also engineered a robust zebrafish model of ADHD that exhibits core behavioral symptoms like hyperactivity and impulsivity. These symptoms are reversed by existing ADHD medications, giving us a solid positive control and validating the model’s predictive power. With this in place, we were positioned to conduct an unbiased drug repurposing screen to identify compounds with improved efficacy or safety profiles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first part of the study, researchers tested five drug candidates in rats bred to exhibit ADHD-like hyperactivity. Among the options, only amlodipine consistently reduced hyperactive behaviors, particularly in female rats. These effects were observed after 30 days of treatment and were confirmed through objective measures such as distance traveled and time spent moving. Other compounds tested did not show significant effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To extend their findings to another species, Karlsson and his colleagues examined how amlodipine affected behavior in zebrafish with a genetic mutation linked to impulsivity and hyperactivity. Zebrafish are a useful model for studying brain function, as they share a large proportion of their genes with humans. In this experiment, the researchers used a behavioral task designed to measure impulsive actions. They found that amlodipine significantly reduced premature responses in the zebrafish, indicating improved impulse control. The results were comparable to those produced by methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then explored whether amlodipine could enter the brain and influence neural activity. They confirmed that the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier in both zebrafish and rats. In zebrafish, exposure to amlodipine reduced activation of a brain region involved in regulating attention and behavior, as indicated by a drop in the expression of a protein called c-Fos. These results suggest that the behavioral effects of amlodipine are likely due to its direct action on the brain, not just its effects on blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The magnitude and consistency of amlodipine’s behavioral effects in our ADHD model were unexpected, given the widespread assumption that the drug does not significantly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB),” Karlsson told PsyPost. “This posed a challenge in interpreting our data: the effects were too robust to plausibly arise from peripheral mechanisms alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Applying Occam’s Razor, the most straightforward explanation was that amlodipine does in fact reach the brain. We confirmed this directly using unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient assays across multiple species, including zebrafish, mice, and rats. These assays demonstrated that amlodipine does cross the BBB, at levels consistent with central nervous system (CNS) activity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how these findings might apply to humans, the researchers conducted genetic analyses using large datasets. One analysis used a technique called Mendelian randomization to explore whether genetic variations that affect calcium channels are linked to ADHD. The results showed a significant association between ADHD and several subunits of L-type calcium channels—the same ones targeted by amlodipine. This supports the idea that these channels may play a role in ADHD symptoms and could be a meaningful treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second genetic analysis looked at data from the UK Biobank, a large-scale health database with genetic and health information from over 500,000 participants. Individuals with a higher genetic risk for ADHD were more likely to report mood swings and risk-taking behavior. However, among those taking amlodipine, these tendencies were less common, suggesting that the drug may help manage some core features of ADHD even outside of a clinical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We identified amlodipine, a commonly prescribed calcium channel blocker for hypertension, as a candidate for repurposing in ADHD,” Karlsson said. “Our findings suggest that it targets a previously underappreciated mechanism in the brain relevant to attention and impulse control. This is significant because it shows how existing medications, already well-characterized in terms of safety and pharmacology, can be redirected to address unmet needs in psychiatric disorders — potentially reducing the time and cost of drug development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that while these findings are promising, amlodipine is not yet approved for ADHD treatment and further testing in clinical trials is necessary. Still, the drug’s long-standing safety record and widespread availability make it an appealing candidate for repurposing. Amlodipine is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, is inexpensive, and has a low risk of drug interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One strength of the study was its multi-pronged approach, which combined laboratory experiments with large-scale human genetic data. By showing consistent effects across species and methods, the researchers were able to build a compelling case for further investigation. The study also introduced a new way of using genetic tools to assess drug effects across multiple biological targets, an approach that could help accelerate drug discovery for other brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research is not without limitations. The animal studies, while informative, do not fully capture the complexity of human ADHD, which involves a wide range of behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Additionally, the genetic analyses relied on self-reported symptoms and indirect measures of ADHD traits rather than formal diagnoses. Future clinical studies will be needed to determine whether the benefits of amlodipine extend to diagnosed individuals and how the drug compares to existing treatments in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While amlodipine shows promise in preclinical models, it is not currently suitable for use in ADHD in its marketed form,” Karlsson noted. “Further optimization through chemical modification is necessary to enhance CNS selectivity and ensure a favorable therapeutic index in the context of ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now preparing to launch a Phase II clinical trial to formally evaluate the safety and effectiveness of amlodipine for ADHD in humans. If successful, this effort could pave the way for a new class of non-stimulant treatments, offering hope to individuals who do not respond to or cannot tolerate current medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the spotlight is on amlodipine and ADHD, this work also represents a proof-of-concept for a broader drug repurposing pipeline for CNS disorders,” Karlsson said. “Our approach combines unbiased screening in disease-relevant zebrafish models with human genetic validation to prioritize and de-risk candidates before clinical development.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;LUBBOCK — When Kelly Johnson Pirtle was counting down the days to her due date last year, she pictured her future as a new mom. She thought of family visits, friends becoming her village, and a healthy child.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;She never considered that she might have to shield her newborn son John from a once-eradicated disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You want your kids to grow up in a world that’s healthy and moving forward,” Johnson said. “That’s not true during the first few months of his life. It makes me sad.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Pirtle is one of many new parents in Lubbock who are growing more anxious as the measles outbreak, and vaccine skepticism, spreads. And Lubbock parents aren’t the only ones terrified of their young children contracting the contagious virus. From January to April 30, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/22/texas-measles-babies-vaccine/"&gt;7,107 babies have received a dose&lt;/a&gt; of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine early, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. It’s the state’s highest number in the last six years. It could be even higher since the data only includes children whose parents opted into submitting their information to the state.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The outbreak has ballooned to 722 cases in Texas since it began in January. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the measles outbreak is now the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;largest single outbreak&lt;/a&gt; since the U.S. declared the disease eliminated 25 years ago. Nine new cases were reported Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/22/texas-measles-outbreak-update/"&gt;lowest number since February&lt;/a&gt;. However, health officials can’t consider an outbreak over until there’s been a 42-day period without a new case.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the outbreak spreads beyond West Texas, skepticism about the vaccine has intensified, including at a national level. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, has &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/29/texas-measles-robert-kennedy-autism/"&gt;spread misinformation about the vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this month, Kennedy ordered federal health agencies to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/health/measles-treatments-vaccines-kennedy.html"&gt;research new treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles. Public health officials have said two doses of the MMR vaccine is the most effective way to prevent measles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  


    
  
&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;However, a lot of time stands between those two doses and a sense of security for new parents. Doctors recommend that children get their first dose of the MMR vaccine when they are 12 months old. The timeline is shorter — just six months — for &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/measles-infographic.pdf"&gt;children in areas with an outbreak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That is the case in Lubbock, about 87 miles northeast of Gaines County where the outbreak started and more than 400 cases have been confirmed. There have been 53 confirmed cases in Lubbock County. Lubbock, with a population of 267,000, is the largest city in the South Plains and serves as a medical hub for the region. Due to a dearth of rural hospitals and physicians, people from all over the region &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/03/16/texas-health-care-deserts/"&gt;flock to Lubbock&lt;/a&gt; for health care.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It has left the city and its residents to figure out how to protect themselves when so much of the outbreak is out of their control. Some new parents in Lubbock have reverted to COVID-era precautions — limited contact with people outside the home and avoiding crowded places. On social media groups, women ask other moms how young babies infected with measles fared, and share details on vaccine clinics. Others share locations where cases have been reported for other parents to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;And at this point, they aren’t just battling the outbreak. They are also battling the consequences of a growing distrust about the vaccine, including school and &lt;a href="https://www.kcbd.com/2025/04/07/lubbocks-public-health-director-discusses-measles-protocols-safety-day-cares/"&gt;child care centers closing&lt;/a&gt; as cases pop up.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A 2024 KFF study found that &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline-as-trump-heads-for-a-second-term/"&gt;exemption rates have gone up&lt;/a&gt; nationwide. The amount of kindergartners in the U.S. who were exempted from at least one required vaccine increased to 3.3%. Since 2018, the requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for an &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/"&gt;exemption form have doubled&lt;/a&gt; from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners reported being vaccinated against measles in the 2023-2024 school year, about 2 percentage points lower than the state average, according to latest state data.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, Texas’ reigning infectious disease expert and physician, said the situation unraveling with vaccine hesitancy is part of the medical freedom movement.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It’s a bit of phony propaganda,” Hotez said. “The only freedom being restricted is the freedom of parents who have to worry about bringing their infant to the store.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;For Pirtle and her husband, Adam, being cautious is the best way they can keep John safe until he gets the first dose. The parents found out their 3-month-old will need open heart surgery at the end of May. The surgery has a high success rate, but if John gets an infection before then, it would have to be postponed.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Even a recent trip to a friend’s baby celebration was cut short because the Pirtles feared the red patch on John’s cheek was measles; it turned out to be baby acne.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Vaccines have always been a team effort,” Adam Pirtle said. “Like with herd immunity, we’re all part of the herd. Then all of a sudden, people decide not to play on the team. That hurts everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

 Annie Rice for The Texas Tribune
        &lt;/cite&gt;
      
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  


    
  
&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Kyle Rable, the father of a 10-week-old in Lubbock, said he and his wife have also had to think carefully about where they take their son. They don’t take him grocery shopping or let strangers near him. They try to only take him out for outdoor events.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Measles wasn’t on our radar. We were more worried about the cold and RSV,” Rable said. “We’re kind of counting down to when we can go get him that shot.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Rable and his wife both work, so their son will start attending child care at the end of this month. They have been listening for any word on if the care center they want to go to has cases pop up.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We can’t really not have him at day care,” Rable said. “We’re hoping everyone keeps up on their child’s vaccines to keep our child safe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Research has shown that measles is a potentially deadly infection where 20% of kids end up being hospitalized. The measles can cause pneumonia, brain inflammation, and permanent neurologic injury along with other long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hotez said babies can’t get the vaccine sooner than six months old because they have maternal antibodies that may affect the vaccine’s effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He said the MMR vaccine is one of the safest, most effective vaccines. However, he doesn’t see the measles outbreak slowing down, as it has spread to low-vaccinated, conservative regions across the U.S. Great Plains.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The worry I have is if this goes on for months and months, eventually we get to the point where we’ve lost our measles elimination status,” Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating contaminated food typically leads to food poisoning, making individuals ill, sometimes severely so. A recent study from the United States has revealed that such incidents can leave a neurological signature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-actirise-slot="top-content" class="device-mobile device-tablet ads"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Significant Progress in Neurological Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food poisoning, often occurring by accident, arises from the consumption of foods or beverages &lt;strong&gt;laden with infectious agents&lt;/strong&gt; (such as bacteria, viruses, etc.) or toxins (like heavy metals). These incidents may also happen due to lapses in hygiene, storage, or preparation methods. Affected individuals typically suffer from vomiting, abdominal pains, headaches, or physical exhaustion, and in severe cases, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from Princeton University’s Neuroscience Institute (USA) published their findings in the journal Nature on April 2, 2025. According to their research, food poisoning &lt;strong&gt;can leave traces in the brain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study conducted on mice outlines a neural pathway that leads to a &lt;strong&gt;distinctive signature specific to food poisoning&lt;/strong&gt;. If it’s confirmed that the same process occurs in the human brain, it could explain why people have clear memories of such incidents. This ability might even be linked to evolutionary progress, helping animals—and potentially humans—&lt;strong&gt;to avoid making the same mistake twice&lt;/strong&gt;, thus steering clear of the same toxic exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neurological Signature as a “Warning Signal”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism described by the neurologists is groundbreaking. There is often a significant &lt;strong&gt;delay between the ingestion of the contaminated food and the onset of initial symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;. Typically, researchers focus on mechanisms that allow for a direct cause-and-effect relationship, which is not the case here. The study’s authors point to the amygdala, a brain region &lt;strong&gt;critical in danger detection,&lt;/strong&gt; based on continuous input from our five senses. Thus, the decision to eat or avoid a food is linked to this brain region, obviously following an encounter with our sense of smell and/or taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their experiment, neurologists provided mice with a type of grape soda, and then half an hour later, they injected the mice with a substance that induced nausea. Despite the time lapse, the mice’s brains linked the drink to the nausea. Subsequently, the mice consistently refused to consume the liquid whenever it was offered, showcasing a &lt;strong&gt;neurological signature akin to a “warning signal”&lt;/strong&gt;, characteristic of one of the functions of the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, these findings indicating such a signature in mouse brains &lt;strong&gt;will need further research&lt;/strong&gt; to confirm the theory in human brains.&lt;/p&gt;

fight &lt;a href="/topic/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and shrink &lt;a href="/topic/tumours"&gt;tumours&lt;/a&gt;, a study finds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/news/health/citlopram-sertraline-antidepressant-thomas-kingston-b2658173.html"&gt;widely used antidepressant&lt;/a&gt; - selective &lt;a href="/topic/serotonin"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs- is used to increase the availability of serotonin in the brain, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in mood, emotion and sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But scientists have also discovered the drug can enhance the ability of T cells, a type of white blood cell, to &lt;a href="/news/health/nhs-children-cancer-patients-finance-england-b2753261.html"&gt;fight cancer and suppress tumour&lt;/a&gt; growth across a range of cancer types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study published in the journal Cell by researchers at &lt;a href="/topic/ucla"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt; in California, looked at both mouse and human tumour models responsible for melanoma, breast, prostate, colon and bladder cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It turns out SSRIs don’t just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier - even while they’re fighting tumours,” said Dr Lili Yang, senior author of the new study and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 hypfIw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/20/10/43/low-res.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/20/10/43/low-res.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/20/10/43/low-res.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Dr Lili Yang senior author of the new study and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-77247"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Dr Lili Yang senior author of the new study and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Elena Zhukova/UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These drugs have been widely and safely used to treat depression for decades, so repurposing them for cancer would be a lot easier than developing an entirely new therapy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While serotonin is best known for the role it plays in the brain, it also plays a role in digestion, metabolism and immune activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Yang and her team first began investigating serotonin’s role in fighting cancer after noticing that immune cells isolated from tumours had higher levels of serotonin-regulating molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, they focused on MAO-A, an enzyme that breaks down serotonin and other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, they reported that T cells produce MAO-A when they recognise tumours, which makes it harder for them to fight cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 fdjKtZ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/24/11/iStock-511477996.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/24/11/iStock-511477996.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2023/11/24/11/iStock-511477996.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Scientists have also discovered the antidepressant drug can enhance the ability of T cells" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-77248"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Scientists have also discovered the antidepressant drug can enhance the ability of T cells&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images/iStockphoto)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that treating mice with melanoma and colon cancer using MAO inhibitors, also called MAOIs - the first class of antidepressant drugs to be invented - helped T cells attack tumours more effectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because MAOIs can cause side-effects and interactions with certain foods, they decided to try a different serotonin-regulating molecule: SERT. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike MAO-A, which breaks down multiple neurotransmitters, SERT has one job - to transport serotonin,” explained Dr Bo Li, first author of the study and a senior research scientist in the Yang lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SERT made for an especially attractive target because the drugs that act on it - SSRIs - are widely used with minimal side effects,” Dr Li said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested SSRIs in mouse and human tumour models representing melanoma, breast, prostate, colon and bladder cancer and found they reduced tumour size by more than half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antidepressant also made cancer-fighting T cells, known as killer T cells, more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tested the antidepressant alongside existing cancer therapies which work by suppressing immune cell activity to allow T cells to attack T cells more effectively. The combination reduced tumour size in all the treated mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, to confirm these findings the team will need to investigate whether real-world cancer patients taking SSRIs have better outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 06:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOai03NF9VdUlQZDQ4NE1NQWQ3QlRJR3Y2UDA5T01acjBUbWJ4a2NWdFhJOWs5MEk4Q3ptcjYwYXY3cE41Y0V2ZEkzLUNod3A4QVBYMlNjdlNLRUprdlJ6em1MV2Z0bWNIVFFKTXk4cjlIbVpMcEFTT2M5RUFVNnNoZHBaOFd4ZC1EWU9Lc2NBakhDTFdrMXpwcVdqQmFHeFZpeFpJ</guid></item><item><title>汽车在I-580上烧得很脆- KOLO | 8新闻 | Car burns to a crisp on I-580 - KOLO | 8 News Now</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9COTFITlNEbnczSmhoZkJRaUpoQ2hrZjNNTFRkcUtQaUwybEdIR1h1anp2STBfVGg3dkpxOE85Qk9vMERxYkF3NnNYMjhXelp6VFFCNW5lMWxVRUtaZFY4emx6SE01cDDSAXtBVV95cUxNNXpxT3BjZ1VPSDh3Yk1EMEdMZXVwSVQxcWFDeTEwMEk4QVp2LWNpcWdhemZoOE1JeHRPQlplek8ySk1GSl9tRnMwaXY4SENNeFFkdXdBYWw4dXRMWVYwVzFZT0NuMmZyNi1LSFVIcUdXd09GOWtpX1BqZ28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body | article w-100"&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;WASHOE VALLEY, Nev.

For instance, when you’re around someone you love, you will behave very differently than you would around someone you dislike. Likewise, your energy will affect the space around you differently, telling each person you are with someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/being-in-love"&gt;Healthline writer Crystal Raypole noted&lt;/a&gt;, “It may not seem like it, but being in love is a somewhat scientific process. Falling in love involves a lot of hormones, which can supercharge your feelings and make them wildly fluctuate. When you’re around the person you love, increases in dopamine and norepinephrine lead to feelings of pleasure, giddiness, nervous excitement, and euphoria.” Because of this, a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 beautiful ways a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. She undergoes physical changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-undergoes-physical-changes.png" alt="woman who is undergoing physical changes" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she undergoes physical changes" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuganov Konstantin | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first ways that a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves most is through a change in her physical energy. Things that should be inexplicable, like a faster heartbeat, increased sweating, or shakiness, can be linked to chemical changes in the body. When you’re around the person you love, you don’t stay the same, quite literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor of human ecology at the University of Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Timothy Loving, explained&lt;/a&gt;, “Part of the whole attraction process is strongly linked to physiological arousal as a whole. Typically, that’s going to start with things like increased heart rate, sweatiness, and so on.” Cardiac electrophysiologist &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Reginald Ho added&lt;/a&gt; that a rush of adrenaline makes someone’s heart beat faster when they see the person they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes occur in a woman’s body when she sees the person she loves the most. These can have a huge impact on her energy and change it in a beautiful way. A woman around the person she loves most will naturally act differently because she has no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/innocent-habits-that-destroy-womans-feminine-energy"&gt;11 Innocent Habits That Destroy A Woman’s Feminine Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. She feels nervous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-feels-nervous.png" alt="woman who feels nervous" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she feels nervous" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most is that she’ll get a bit nervous. The exact level of anxious energy she feels can differ depending on the person, but there’s a good chance she’ll feel some nerves around the person she loves. While some mistake this nervous energy for a general feeling of anxiety, it’s likely that she feels this way because of the person she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;VeryWell Mind writer Sian Ferguson explained&lt;/a&gt; that we all engage in nervous habits, but sometimes they can be a sign of something more. “Nervous habits are those little behaviors people tend to do without even realizing it — like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or shifting in their seat. They’re just our natural reactions to feeling uncomfortable or excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;Hannah Owens, LMSW, said&lt;/a&gt; that exhibiting these habits around the person you love is normal. “Feeling a romantic interest in somebody can be anxiety-inducing — you don’t know if they reciprocate the feelings, and you’re focused on making a good first impression, which can be nerve-wracking,” she said. In other words, a woman bringing some nervous energy to the room when she loves someone is normal and can indicate just how interested she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/beautiful-traits-of-people-who-radiate-good-energy"&gt;11 Beautiful Traits Of People Who Radiate Good Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. She is connected to her partner’s emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-connected-partners-emotions.png" alt="woman who is connected to her partner's emotions" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she is connected to her partner’s emotions" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Rachata Teyparsit | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman in tune with her partner will be connected to their emotions. In fact, she may even absorb those emotions. A woman in love will naturally want to be as close to her partner as possible, even to the point of feeling their same emotions and understanding exactly how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage and family therapist &lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/stop-absorbing-other-peoples-emotions"&gt;Amanda Turecek shared&lt;/a&gt; that this can be particularly prevalent for highly sensitive people (HSP). “Research seems to indicate that certain neurons — mirror neurons — act differently in the brains of HSP than in the brains of non-HSP,” she said. “Mirror neurons kick in to gear in our prefrontal cortex, our area of the brain that also controls things like morality and planning around consequences. They encourage us to imitate others and are more active in the brains of HSPs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, highly sensitive people are more likely to imitate those around them. If a woman is an HSP, she may be more likely to absorb emotions from those around her, especially the person she loves most, as that is likely also who she admires the most.

Scientists have often debated whether women are more nurturing and compassionate than men, something Emma Seppala &lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" rel="nofollow"&gt; in UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seppala noted that women are often measured to have more oxytocin. “Women may at times have higher levels of oxytocin — sometimes called the ‘cuddle hormone’ or ‘love hormone’ because it is linked to bonding, social connection and monogamy,” she said. “It is produced in women during labor and lactation in women and is believed to trigger bonding and nurturing behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether women are more compassionate than men is still debatable, but based on explanations like these, women have plenty of reasons to be nurturing. Even setting levels of oxytocin aside, many women are nurturing around those they love. Being around the one they love most would surely bring out this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/early-clues-someone-energy-pure-poison"&gt;15 Early Clues Someone's Energy Is Pure Poison, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5.

That being said, many women who are in love will make what are sometimes subtle, difficult-to-notice changes to become more like their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-to-do-life/202109/are-you-becoming-more-like-your-partner"&gt;Marty Nemko, PhD, noted&lt;/a&gt; that becoming more like your partner is completely normal over time. In fact, it would probably be strange not to. He advocates taking inventory of oneself so you can determine whether or not those changes are things you feel like celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, a woman’s energy will likely subtly shift to become closer to that of the person she loves the most. Because she spends so much time around that person and is so interested in them, she will naturally lean into their energy and adapt it for her own purposes. Sometimes these changes will be noticeable, and sometimes they’ll be so small you can’t pick them up without paying close attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/types-of-people-not-worth-your-time-or-energy-according-research"&gt;11 Types Of People That Are Not Worth Your Time Or Energy, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6.

Based on their wants and needs, she will do the things she knows will keep them satisfied. Her energy will change because she will be focused almost solely on her partner, drowning out the noise of the world and keeping her attention where she feels it is most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-at-any-age/202501/why-its-so-important-to-listen-to-your-partner"&gt;Susan Krauss Whitbourne, PhD, ABPP, cited&lt;/a&gt; a study from Florida State University, which found that “mindfulness in relationships is a key component of being able to take the perspective of your partner. This, in turn, makes partners more compassionate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is focused on her partner, she is more likely to be mindful of them and compassionate towards them. Putting what they want and need before what she wants and needs herself shifts her energy so that it is beautifully centered on her partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-main-character-energy"&gt;7 Harsh Signs Someone Has Main Character Energy And You're Just An Extra, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7.

Doing things like holding hands, hugging, and touching will bring two people closer together. Her energy will change as she feels closer to her partner, and she will feel loved and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An article published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7485933/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Social and Personality Psychology Compass&lt;/a&gt; noted that relationships affect one’s health for good and bad. “Positive aspects of close relationships, such as intimacy and social support, predict better health outcomes, including longer survival following a breast cancer diagnosis, and improved emotional well-being,” researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels close to her partner, it will lead to better health outcomes for both. This will give a woman a brighter, lighter energy. As her physical energy changes, so will her emotional and spiritual energy. She will become a light for those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/subtle-ways-weak-man-drains-powerful-womans-energy-without-her-realizing"&gt;10 Subtle Ways A Weak Man Drains A Powerful Woman’s Energy Without Her Realizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

A single glance can spark an argument, while a simple touch on the shoulder can mend wounded pride. And sometimes, the sting of words is easier to bear than the weight of crushing silence. There’s power in what goes unspoken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who can communicate with her partner without words will have a different energy around her. She feels more assured both in who she is and in her relationship. This confidence can be powerful and radiates to everyone around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-increase-aura-make-people-instantly-attracted-energy"&gt;11 Ways To Increase Your Aura And Make People Instantly Attracted To Your Energy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9.

It’s about establishing trust with another person and feeling safe enough to be open and vulnerable with them. To put it simply, emotional safety is feeling secure enough to truly express yourself with someone and show up as your most authentic self.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is around the person she loves most, she will feel physically and emotionally safe. This sense of security will transform her energy into something more confident and ready for anything.

She won’t be afraid to share how she’s feeling or unpack her baggage because she knows her partner has her back completely.

This emotional openness is essential in all healthy relationships, as it paves the way for deeper understanding and evokes the empathy necessary for healthy long-term relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels she can be vulnerable with the person she loves the most, that vulnerable energy will transfer to her everyday life.

Her future will appear more exciting with her partner in the picture, and she will feel better about herself. This excitement will translate into her energy as she lights up the room and the world around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can feel similar to what some call “new relationship energy.” &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/new-relationship-energy-8679124"&gt;Psychotherapist Kristin Papa, LCSW, said&lt;/a&gt;, “New relationship energy usually refers to the intense excitement, euphoria, and almost electrical sensation typically experienced at the beginning of a romantic relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New relationship energy causes excitement that shows in a woman’s energy. The great thing is Papa confirmed this feeling can last well after the “honeymoon phase” is over.

            The US Food and Drug Administration will now require Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to use expanded warning labels with more information about the risk of a rare heart condition after vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi00083b6mdo0oyg8a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccines’ previous labels warned about the risk of a heart condition called myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the lining outside the heart, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/covid-19.html#:~:text=In%20rare%20cases%2C%20people%20have,EpiPen)%20and%20may%20require%20hospitalization." target="_blank"&gt;says is rare&lt;/a&gt; but possible after vaccination. The new labels will expand that warning to certain age groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi00093b6mkkqs035y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2822933" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has consistently shown that the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and millions of people have gotten them without serious incident. Some studies have found that Covid-19 infection itself carries a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/vaccine-considerations/safety-considerations.html#:~:text=Cases%20of%20myocarditis%20and%20pericarditis,BioNTech%29%20and%20myocarditis%20and%20pericarditis." target="_blank"&gt;higher&lt;/a&gt; risk of myocarditis or pericarditis than the vaccine does.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000a3b6mi96nli2t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC last month &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dNCVr9AvFB8" target="_blank"&gt;told its independent vaccine advisers &lt;/a&gt;that research showed Covid-19 vaccinations from 2020 through 2022 showed a statistically significant increased risk of myocarditis. The incidents were rare, however, and “there is no increased risk observed with the doses administered in subsequent years,” the agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000b3b6m0nw5zpjd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the rare case that someone did develop heart inflammation after vaccination, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dNCVr9AvFB8" target="_blank"&gt;told the advisers&lt;/a&gt;, acute myocarditis typically resolves quickly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000e3b6mhk8gwi1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccines already carried warnings that the highest risk of these heart problems was observed in males between ages 18 and 24 for the Moderna vaccine and 12 to 17 for Pfizer’s; the new warnings for both vaccines will be for males age 16 to 25.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000c3b6mwj18n0hj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In letters to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186581/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/186580/download?attachment" target="_blank"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; that were dated April 17 and are now posted online, the agency says analysis of commercial health insurance claims data shows that there were eight cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million vaccine doses given to people ages 6 months through 64 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000d3b6miervdssd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cases were more common among males ages 16 through 25 within seven days of vaccination, but they were still rare, with about 38 cases of myocarditis and/or pericarditis per million doses among this group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services said Wednesday that the move was intended to increase “radical transparency.” Neither Pfizer nor Moderna responded to requests&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for comment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The vaccines were developed during the first Trump administration and underwent what &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/covid-19.html#:~:text=In%20rare%20cases%2C%20people%20have,EpiPen)%20and%20may%20require%20hospitalization." target="_blank"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt; was “the most intensive safety analysis in US history,” and the agency continues to monitor vaccine administration data for effectiveness and any potential problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/health/novavax-covid-vaccine-trial"&gt;falsely&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the Covid-19 vaccine was “the deadliest vaccine ever made.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000i3b6mmy0sy6ki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a US Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/the-corruption-of-science-and-federal-health-agencies-how-health-officials-downplayed-and-hid-myocarditis-and-other-adverse-events-associated-with-the-covid-19-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday,  Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, claimed that the Biden administration downplayed the risks of the vaccine and delayed getting information about those risks to the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym4jcp00003b6mxu3ahtkz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One witness, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a family physician, said in his &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/Hon.-Green-Testimony.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; the US vaccine safety monitoring systems worked “exactly as intended” by detecting rare cases of myocarditis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaymn9oj000e3b6mndo4jmv0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The data were made public, warnings were updated, and clinical guidance was revised accordingly,” Green said. “Despite this, some continue to promote misleading interpretations, unverified claims or anecdotes to suggest that vaccines are broadly unsafe.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmaym3zyi000k3b6menjpd6w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank"&gt;On Tuesday,&lt;/a&gt; the FDA said it would change the type of evidence it will accept from vaccine manufacturers to approve updated Covid shots, which may limit who is eligible for updated shots. The vaccines are expected to be be available in the fall, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/health/covid-vaccine-fda-changes"&gt;but only&lt;/a&gt; for adults 65 and older and people with underlying conditions that put them at a higher risk for severe Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

Most people will be exposed to HSV-1 in their lives and lots of people get &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/are-cold-sores-genetic-72344" target="_blank"&gt;cold sores&lt;/a&gt;, so this conclusion might sound alarming, but it’s important to understand what the paper is actually saying – and what it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the study about and what did it show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly published paper comes from an international team of researchers working at Gilead Sciences Inc., a US pharmaceutical company developing drugs for a number of different diseases, including HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had a retrospective case-control design. Patients with a diagnosis of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/alzheimer-s-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; or Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (ADRD) were matched with a control participant of the same age and sex, living in the same region, and with a similar health history except for one key difference: the controls had no history of neurological disorders. In total, 344,628 pairs were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the people with Alzheimer’s or ADRD, it was found that 0.44 percent of them had been diagnosed with HSV-1. In the control group, it was 0.25 percent. These are both tiny fractions of the overall number of people, but the difference between these two figures was found to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for other health conditions that could play a role, the team concluded that those with Alzheimer’s disease/ADRD were 80 percent more likely to have been diagnosed with HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another finding was that those who had used an antiviral medication to treat their HSV-1 seemed to be somewhat protected and were 17 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the topline findings focused on HSV-1, the team also looked at two similar viruses: HSV-2, the more common cause of genital &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antiviral-chewing-gum-made-of-beans-could-help-stop-spread-of-herpes-and-flu-78716" target="_blank"&gt;herpes&lt;/a&gt;; and varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus responsible for chickenpox and shingles. Both of these were also associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can be concluded from this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of study can only show that two factors are linked in some way; it cannot show that one &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/if-correlation-does-not-mean-causation-how-do-scientists-prove-stuff-78590" target="_blank"&gt;causes&lt;/a&gt; the other. There are also limitations to the study – as with every research project – that must be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the large sample size, this research has limitations partly due to only using health records and administrative claims data,” said Dr Sheona Scales, Director of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, in a statement to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-the-cold-sore-virus-herpes-simplex-1-and-risk-of-alzheimers/" target="_blank"&gt;Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;. “Most people infected with HSV-1 don’t have any symptoms so some infections might not have been recorded. Infections predating the information recorded are also not available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scientists have been more critical. Dr David Vickers, of the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, commented, “This pharma-funded research exaggerates the role of HSV-1, failing to appreciate its absence in 99.56 percent of [Alzheimer’s disease] cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s data source makes its findings ungeneralisable, and it overstates a minor infection as a ‘public health priority’ to justify unnecessary treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a number of others, including Professor Tara Spires-Jones of the University of Edinburgh and Professor Cornelia van Duijn of the University of Oxford, praised the study for its careful methodological design, whilst acknowledging that this can’t be the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed to understand the best way to protect our brains from Alzheimer’s disease as we age,” said Spires-Jones, adding that “it is important to note that HSV-1 infection, which is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/pretty-much-everybody-s-got-herpes-31677" target="_blank"&gt;extremely common&lt;/a&gt; in the population, is by no means a guarantee that someone will develop Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HSV-1 and Alzheimer's: What evidence do we already have?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is part of a much broader conversation and a growing body of evidence suggesting that HSV-1 and similar viruses can have a direct impact on the brain, which may include Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-the-cold-sore-virus-that-you-probably-have-silently-invades-the-human-brain-76636" target="_blank"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Virology used a mouse model to show that HSV-1 can enter the brain via both the brainstem and olfactory nerve, triggering an inflammatory response that can persist when the virus is no longer detectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/rampant-herpes-virus-could-reach-the-brain-via-the-nose-sparking-behavior-changes-78448" target="_blank"&gt;Earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, a team at the University of Illinois Chicago led a study that found HSV-1 particles can be shed in tears and can reach the nasal cavity that way, moving directly into the brain and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/6/679" target="_blank"&gt;2021 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Vaccines even went as far as to argue that the evidence for a “major role” for HSV-1 in Alzheimer’s disease was “overwhelming”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying viruses explain everything. But they may be central to it. This is no longer a fringe theory – it’s the next phase of Alzheimer’s research, and we’re pursuing it,” said Dr Bryce Vissel, Director of the Centre for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, in a comment to the &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cold-sores-implicated-in-the-development-of-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Australian Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Vissel’s research group are also actively conducting studies in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though most of the experts agree that more research is needed to better understand what’s going on, some have pointed to the fact that this study seems to suggest that treating HSV-1 with antiviral medications could help combat the potential damage to the brain. They say doing more to treat and detect these infections, even while the research continues, may not be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With many GPs and the population being unaware of the dementia related benefits of treating HSV infections and preventing VZV activation through vaccination, it is time to call for actions informing those working in primary care as well as the population at large,” said van Duijn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you were &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antivaxxing-hot-spot-sees-largest-chickenpox-outbreak-in-decades-50626" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, chances are you were exposed to VZV as a kid; there are now vaccines available that prevent the virus reactivating later in life as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;shingles&lt;/a&gt;, and you can ask a healthcare professional about availability where you are. As for HSV-1 and 2, many people may be infected without ever having any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are worried about a cold sore or your general health, be sure to seek the appropriate help from a health professional,” recommends Dr Richard Oakley, Director of Research and Innovation at Alzheimer’s Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/5/e093946" target="_blank"&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:55:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQYkY2LWJGVmdrT3FFWGhqUVYwN2tkRUZ0NWhhQXFZQzBacDhvRDNCWkNON2VGWVlmY3Y3dWZDMEkwYlFqeVNrRTZiNmZ3bXoxb2JrZ3h5YTRlRW5iUlRQd0RiZUEzSDVQcFlNb2RNWVRiUjM3SFE3VlYyRkxmeW1tcUdNTmhBV1BaUHVZRDh6TWNVVk1NY20xSS1UUTVzZGw0Wld2anZDTXFZdzBzOUdTQVl3Z0sycFMw</guid></item><item><title>认知训练可以减少抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍患者的负面自我认知- PsyPost | Cognitive training may reduce negative self-perceptions in people with depression and PTSD - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQazBqSmVDczI0TGFBTnlyT3dBc1poMHktaFZQUl9uTk4tdDZXQkp1X2dMYjctMnhoUEVLSVdTM0pNbnZjaTZYdXBoV0doZHFDeERxNi14TTVnSjNfM0FTZ3F5MVBEVWZIaHNvTXFEa0dILXpsc3RwODdGbUIxSjdyTDdfTG8yek1Pc3FlU2FmeUtLeVZSaXJzVElXWUFEUHBPZ3I2NXpjdTdLQ2JFdlF5c2Rnb19VUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder tend to underestimate their cognitive abilities—a pattern that may worsen their mental health. A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2025-18950-001" target="_blank"&gt;Neuropsychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that this negative self-perception, known as metacognitive bias, is both common and severe in individuals with high levels of depressive and PTSD symptoms. The researchers also found that targeted or game-based cognitive training can improve these biases and may contribute to a reduction in symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression and PTSD are two of the most common mental health conditions, often marked by persistent negative thoughts and emotional distress. Depression is characterized by symptoms such as sadness, low energy, and loss of interest in daily activities, while PTSD can involve intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders, emotional numbness, and heightened arousal following exposure to traumatic events. Both conditions are known to distort how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in how metacognition—the ability to reflect on and evaluate one’s own thoughts and abilities—may influence mental health. One important aspect of metacognition is “metacognitive bias,” or the tendency to systematically overestimate or underestimate one’s own abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people in the general population often show a slight tendency to overestimate themselves, this study focused on the opposite problem: large-scale underestimation among individuals with depression and PTSD. The researchers wanted to examine how strongly these negative self-perceptions were related to symptoms and whether cognitive training could help reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, researchers reanalyzed data from a randomized controlled trial known as the BRAVE study, which involved 84 participants, mostly military veterans, who had experienced mild traumatic brain injuries and reported cognitive difficulties. About three-quarters of the participants had either elevated depression, PTSD symptoms, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were randomly assigned to one of two 13-week training programs: a “targeted cognitive training” group that completed computerized exercises designed to improve attention, memory, and executive function, or an “entertainment training” group that played puzzle and board games like Tetris and Solitaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after the training, participants completed a variety of assessments. Self-reported cognitive performance was measured using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, a validated 25-item scale that captures daily lapses in attention and memory. Objective cognitive performance was evaluated using a battery of tests measuring learning, memory, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. By comparing self-perceived and actual performance, researchers calculated each participant’s metacognitive bias. Depression and PTSD symptoms were also measured using well-established clinical questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the study, the researchers found that people with elevated depression or PTSD symptoms significantly underestimated their cognitive abilities compared to their actual test scores. On average, participants with both conditions scored nearly 2.3 standard deviations below the norm in their self-assessments, despite relatively mild objective impairments. This discrepancy—referred to as a negative global metacognitive bias—was strongly linked to the severity of depression and PTSD symptoms. The researchers found no evidence that these negative biases were linked to specific types of cognitive impairment, suggesting that they reflect a broader pattern of self-doubt rather than performance in a particular area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the 13-week intervention period, participants in both the targeted and entertainment training groups showed notable improvements. Those who completed either program reported fewer cognitive problems, reduced depression symptoms, and improved metacognitive accuracy. Importantly, the size of the improvement in metacognitive bias was correlated with the reduction in both depression and PTSD symptoms. This relationship was especially strong in the entertainment training group, where participants who most improved their self-perception also experienced the greatest mental health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while both training programs improved self-reported cognition and metacognitive bias, only the targeted training group showed small, non-significant trends toward better objective cognitive performance. This suggests that the subjective feeling of improved cognitive ability—rather than actual test performance—may play a more important role in symptom improvement for people with depression and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the performance feedback embedded in both training programs may be key to these improvements. In both training conditions, participants received feedback on their progress and were rewarded for correct performance, helping them to form more accurate beliefs about their cognitive abilities. This positive reinforcement may have helped counteract the negative thinking patterns common in depression and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months after training ended, participants continued to report lower depression symptoms, and those in the entertainment group also maintained improvements in PTSD symptoms and metacognitive bias. These lasting effects suggest that cognitive training—especially when designed to be engaging and motivating—may have durable benefits for people struggling with self-doubt and negative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers promising evidence, the authors note several limitations. The sample consisted primarily of military veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other groups. Additionally, the study did not include a no-treatment control group, making it difficult to rule out the influence of nonspecific effects such as time, attention, or participant expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies with larger, more diverse samples and more rigorous control conditions will be needed to confirm whether improvements in metacognitive bias can directly lead to reductions in depression and PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/neu0000967" target="_blank"&gt;Negative Global Metacognitive Biases Are Associated With Depressive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Improve With Targeted or Game-Based Cognitive Training&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sam Agnoli, Henry Mahncke, Sarah-Jane Grant, Zachary T.

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health said cases of pertussis are on the rise in the state, and is urging residents to keep up with recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said, as of May 15, there have been 108 cases of pertussis reported, compared to 84 cases for all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease spread through the air via the coughs or sneezes of an infected person,” said DOH in a news release. “Initially, the symptoms resemble a cold but can progress to intense coughing fits. In children, coughing fits can be followed by a deep breath that makes a whooping sound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health complications from pertussis can be serious and even life-threatening, DOH said, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some potential complications include pneumonia, seizures, apnea (a pause in breathing), encephalopathy (a disease of the brain) and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most effective way to prevent pertussis is through vaccination with either the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccines,” said DOH. “Multiple doses are recommended for infants, children and adults.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DOH said no further cases of measles have been reported in the state following the two confirmed in early April — one in a &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;child under age 5 &lt;/a&gt;and the other in an adult household member — related to international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH has concluded there was no further community spread from those two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are concerned, however, of the growing number of cases on the mainland, which has now surpassed 1,000 across 30 states this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DOH recommends continued vigilance and efforts to increase the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rate,” said the department. “High vaccination rates protect individuals and communities and prevent cases from becoming outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates for all routinely recommended vaccinations for school entry, including those for measles, pertussis, polio and chickenpox, have declined in Hawaii and nationally since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH strongly recommends that children and adults stay up-to-date with recommended vaccinations to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. It also encourages residents to discuss concerns about vaccines with a trusted health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study linked high-quality carbohydrate intake in midlife to healthier aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-quality carbs include those from whole grains, fruits, non-starchy vegetables and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those carbs were associated with better physical function and cognitive health decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you eat in your 40s and 50s might help determine how well you age decades later. According to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, women who consumed more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938733/healthiest-carbs-you-should-be-buying-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality carbohydrates and fiber&lt;/a&gt; in midlife were significantly more likely to reach older adulthood with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;good physical and cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;—and without major chronic illnesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study supports what nutrition experts have long suspected: it’s not just about how many carbohydrates you eat, but which ones you choose. Carbs from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole plant foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains were linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-diet-to-reach-70-study-11703981" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher likelihood of healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, diets high in refined &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; (think: cookies, white-flour pasta) had the opposite effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for simple, sustainable ways to support your future health, this research makes a strong case for upgrading the quality of your carbs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Tufts University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a prospective cohort study—a study that follows a group of people over time—using data from the well-known Nurses’ Health Study. This long-running study has followed more than 100,000 female nurses since 1976, collecting detailed information about their diets, lifestyles and health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, the researchers focused on more than 47,000 women who were under the age of 60 in 1984. Participants completed comprehensive food frequency questionnaires in 1984 and 1986, and researchers tracked their diets and health outcomes over the next 30-plus years. By 2016, the women were between ages 70 and 93.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just under 8% of the women qualified as healthy agers. To define “healthy aging,” the researchers looked for women who met all of the following criteria: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;They were free from 11 major chronic diseases (including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They had no significant memory or physical impairments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They reported good mental health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers then analyzed the associations between different types of carbohydrate intake in midlife and the odds of meeting that definition of healthy aging decades later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The biggest takeaway was simple: quality counts when it comes to carbs and aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women who ate more high-quality carbohydrates—specifically those found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes—had significantly greater odds of aging in good health. Every 10% increase in calories from these types of carbs was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; was also linked to better outcomes. The analysis found that consuming high-quality carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher total dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; during midlife, was associated with a 6% to 37% higher chance of healthy aging and improvements in various aspects of mental and physical health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, diets high in refined carbohydrates—those from added sugars, white bread, and other processed grains—were linked to worse outcomes. Women who ate more refined carbs had a 13% lower likelihood of aging well. Starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn were also associated with poorer aging markers, particularly when consumed in large amounts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also examined &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL)&lt;/a&gt;, which reflect how much and how quickly a carbohydrate-rich food raises blood sugar. A higher GI and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-with-more-fiber-than-brown-rice-8710406" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio&lt;/a&gt; were both associated with significantly lower odds of healthy aging. Interestingly, GL was positively associated with healthy aging, but that association weakened when fiber intake was factored in—suggesting that fiber-rich foods were driving the benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, the researchers looked at what would happen if certain macronutrients were replaced with high-quality carbs. Replacing refined carbohydrates, fat or animal protein with high-quality carbs resulted in a 7% to 16% increase in the odds of healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that the “high-quality carbs” linked to healthy aging are easy to find in your local grocery store—and likely already part of your diet. And if you want to add more of them to your noshing routine, we have some recipes and recommendations to help you on that front.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can start by choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; more often. Opt for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/grain-bowl-recipes-to-make-forever-8604226" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brown rice, quinoa, oats, bulgur or farro&lt;/a&gt; instead of white rice or refined pasta. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280144/farro-salad-with-grilled-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Farro Salad with Grilled Chicken&lt;/a&gt; or brown rice-packed &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7934153/chicken-spinach-rice-casserole-with-sun-dried-tomato-cream-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Chicken, Spinach and Rice Casserole&lt;/a&gt; make whole grains as tasty as they are nutritious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We also know that piling on the produce is a great choice for healthy carbs. Try adding an extra serving of vegetables or fruit to each meal. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/274447/fresh-vs-canned-vs-frozen-which-is-better/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Frozen and canned options&lt;/a&gt; (without added sugar or salt) are great, affordable choices. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Adding legumes&lt;/a&gt; to your routine can help, too. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eat-more-beans-with-these-recipes-11709540" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Beans, lentils and chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; are budget-friendly, fiber-packed sources of plant-based carbs and protein. They’re the stars of delicious bites like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-lentils-11720903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Marry Me Lentils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chickpea-sweet-potato-grain-bowls-8703855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Chickpea &amp;amp; Sweet Potato Grain Bowls&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And making some snacking changes could help you out, too—especially if you tend to opt for more processed, refined snacks. Try switching processed favorites like crackers and chips for options like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brain-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8639130" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fresh fruit, roasted chickpeas or whole grain toast&lt;/a&gt; with nut butter. These small changes can build up over time, potentially helping to preserve your mental clarity, physical strength and overall well-being well into your later years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open &lt;/em&gt;suggests that women who eat more high-quality carbs in midlife may experience better health as they age. Women who ate more fiber-rich foods and carbs from fruits, veggies and whole grains in midlife had better odds of staying healthy, active and sharp as they got older. This study adds to growing evidence that not all carbs are created equal—especially when it comes to aging well. Choosing more whole, plant-based carbs over refined ones could be a simple yet powerful strategy to support healthy aging.

Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sleeping under a bed net has been one of the most successful ways of preventing malaria as the main malaria-spreading mosquitoes hunt at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Vaccines to protect children living in high-risk malaria areas are also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nets are both a physical barrier and also contain insecticides which kill mosquitoes that land on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticide in many countries so the chemicals no longer kill the insects as effectively as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We haven't really tried to directly kill parasites in the mosquito before this, because we were just killing the mosquito," says researcher Dr Alexandra Probst, from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, she says that approach is "no longer cutting it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers analysed malaria's DNA to find possible weak spots while it is infecting mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They took a large library of potential drugs and narrowed it down to a shortlist of 22. These were tested when female mosquitoes were given a blood-meal contaminated with malaria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09039-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In their article in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists describe two highly effective drugs that killed 100% of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The drugs were tested on material similar to bed nets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Even if that mosquito survives contact with the bed net, the parasites within are killed and so it's still not transmitting malaria," said Dr Probst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think this is a really exciting approach, because it's a totally new way of targeting mosquitoes themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She says the malaria parasite is less likely to become resistant to the drugs as there are billions of them in each infected person, but less than five in each mosquito. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The effect of the drugs lasts for a year on the nets, potentially making it a cheap and long-lasting alternative to insecticide, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This approach has been proven in the laboratory. The next stage is already planned in Ethiopia to see if the anti-malarial bed nets are effective in the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It will take at least six years before all the studies are completed to know if this approach will work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the vision is to have bed nets treated with both anti-malaria drugs and insecticide so that if one approach doesn't work, then the other will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE8ya2U1TUJKeHFRYUI1dEdjdThLY05lU045dDRZOHU5RjlGR1dIWGxpTVNMV1Y2elNMN0J0Ukp5ejdCWUNHU1htN0tpYlZGRmNyTVdiUVE3SEZTd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5vOXY1R1VzeHBzYXhrLXlSdHB5WTdFdGI0b2VJazFmM0xsUlN0c1ZKT0J5VVdMYUxXaGhzT1pITm9oaTRSQkhZQVNUOHFZUDJLMHI1RDZrSDhGQlNEekpF</guid></item><item><title>呼吁NHS为乳房密集的女性提供额外的癌症扫描- BBC | Call for NHS to give women with dense breasts extra cancer scans - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9ma3BheDJhRzBTZ1NxTmZIRklCRDZia0pKTlFMU2tId3piWVdLQThlU0ZoNDVfdEQ2RUo1bVRDcjdTeUxsSmE3WE01VVpIWHdSVTRkaVhrZHlxZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE92M1BzbTlhQkJCc0dDWTg0WEFYeUZsc1NKbHdyNTgweVhvQ0lXZDFVZmswSURKX2VFd3pGOTA2OUFETzdUZnZtandfcFI1YXFIeW9ZdVRwYVBhZ2Qtb3Jv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Call for NHS to give women with dense breasts extra cancer scans&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A woman goes for a mammogram.

One of these processes is maintaining a healthy pH, which is the balance between acid and base. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral—anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above it is basic or alkaline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, stomach (hydrochloric) acid needs to be very acidic for proper digestion. It ranks at about a 1, just above battery acid, but your blood pH should be at a neutral 7. And our bodies have amazing built-in mechanisms for regulating and maintaining blood pH. For example, if your body senses excessive levels of acid, your lungs and kidneys go to work to remedy the situation by expelling carbon dioxide through breathing and urinating. Or the pancreas will secrete bicarbonate, a compound that helps buffer acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the body is designed to adjust to its environment to bring it back to center, there are some questions as to whether too much of certain foods might play a role in creating a more acidic environment, especially in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This then lends to questioning whether a more acidic GI tract increases the risk of GI cancers, including liver, colorectal, gastric (stomach), pancreatic and esophageal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers in Korea observed that there is some evidence that people who eat a Western-style diet—one high in fat and sugar—create a more acidic environment in their bodies that is favorable for malignant cell growth. They took a closer look at this theory and recently published their findings in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Best Foods to Eat for Gut Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Best Foods to Eat for Gut Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Data was drawn from a long-term Korean study called the Cancer Screenee Cohort, which began in 2002. Almost 11,000 participants were used for this current study, about 64% of them female, with an average age at baseline of 53. Participants were followed on average for eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants had completed food frequency questionnaires, from which researchers calculated “dietary acid loads” using three different methods. Researchers determined the number of GI cancer cases using the 2020 Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, which records most instances of cancer in the country. In addition, they checked electronic medical records to catch any cases that might not have been recorded in the cancer incidence database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Demographic information that would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included BMI (which was measured by trained staff), physical activity levels, education level, occupation, marital status, first-degree family history of cancer, smoking status and alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Did This Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, researchers found that individuals who were diagnosed with GI cancer tended to have a more acidogenic diet than those without GI cancer. And as the dietary acid load score increased, so did the risk of GI cancer. This association was much stronger in males compared to females. For this study, researchers note red and processed meats as being the primary acidic foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers aren’t sure why male participants had a higher risk of GI cancers than female participants, even when dietary acid load scores were similar, but offer a few possible explanations. First, they state that females tend to have better kidney function than males, thereby giving females a greater capacity for acid-base balance maintenance. They also state that there could be sex hormones involved, since estrogen tends to have a protective effect at the cellular level—which then raises the question for post-menopausal women. Lastly, in this analysis, the males tended to have higher acidic diets, including higher alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to note a few limitations of this study. First, this study cannot determine causation. In other words, it cannot conclude that more acidic foods, which include red and processed meats, cause GI cancer. It can only suggest a strong association between the two. There may be other factors at work, as well, such as genetics or smoking and high alcohol intake, though these were adjusted for in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers also note that they could not take supplement use into consideration as a confounder since there wasn’t enough information on that (certain supplements may raise or lower acid load). Finally, they note that the study population was relatively small, which may have reduced the statistical power of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You’ve probably seen ads for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7961286/what-is-alkaline-water-and-is-it-healthy-heres-what-dietitians-have-to-say/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alkaline water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;alkaline water&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to companies jumping on the idea that we can control the acid-base balance in our bodies. And though this study would certainly lean that direction, there is still so much we don’t yet know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While our bodies are designed to constantly work to maintain internal stability, is it possible that they can go into acid overload from certain foods that end up hijacking the body’s biological systems? There is evidence that suggests yes, but don’t go investing in expensive bottled water just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These researchers suggest a simpler swap—red and processed meats for fruits and veggies, which tend to be more alkaline. Exceptions include citrus fruits and tomatoes, which rank from 2 and 4 on the pH scale. But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat them. Citrus fruits and tomatoes offer loads of nutrition and health benefits, including immune support and antioxidants that calm inflammation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-to-lower-colon-cancer-risk-11716524" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Citrus fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;/a&gt; are even connected with a lower rate of colon cancer—which raises the question about whether it’s really the acid load or something else about red and processed meats that might increase the GI cancer risk, since citrus fruits are more acidic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The key is to eat a variety of foods, including different types of plants—fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. This ensures you not only get the nutrients your body needs, but it also spreads out the pH levels among the plants you’re eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do a quick assessment of your eating pattern. Are you including a lot of red and processed meats? How about foods and beverages with high levels of added sugar? Where can you start rotating in more plants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eating habits, like other habits, are pathways in our brains. These pathways were forged somewhere in your past and became automatic. To start new habits, you need to make purposeful, intentional choices because otherwise, your brain will automatically choose the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-and-longevity-8430567" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Habit You Should Start to Live Longer, According to Health Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The #1 Habit You Should Start to Live Longer, According to Health Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Habit change tends to be easier for people if they start small. Choose an area you’re likely to have success with, so that you can build on that success over time. For example, could you exchange one of your daily sodas or energy drinks for a flavored sparkling water (so you’re still getting the bubbles)? If you typically have that beverage for a mid-afternoon energy boost, could you instead have an energizing snack—like a handful of nuts and a piece of fruit—to accomplish the same thing? Or sometimes we just need to change our physiology for an energy boost, in which case, taking a quick break from your desk and walking a lap or two around your house or office space might do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These researchers also mention the Mediterranean diet as an eating pattern characterized by high fruit and vegetable intake and low or moderate meat intake. Because of this, the Mediterranean diet is associated with high levels of adiponectin, a compound known for its protective role against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re ready to dive in and work on changing your overall eating pattern, we’ve got plenty of Mediterranean diet meal plans and recipes to choose from.

&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the Sachem School District, 116 students and seven staff members were identified as having had prolonged contact with the infected student, and were offered tests on Monday at the school’s East Campus. Individuals who were tested received TB skin testing administered by the Suffolk County Health Department. Results from those tests typically take 48 hours to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;So far, there have been no additional cases confirmed within the school community, but the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Concerned parents are demanding more information and greater transparency from school and health officials. “What’s being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?” asked Janie Gallo, a Farmingville resident and parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Tuberculosis is a potentially serious bacterial infection that typically affects the lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says TB spreads through the air when a person with active TB disease coughs, sneezes or talks. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue and fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;As of now, the New York State Department of Health reports there have been 16 confirmed TB cases in Suffolk County and 18 in neighboring Nassau County this year — numbers that are consistent with last year’s data for the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials say those initially tested this week will need to undergo another round of testing in July, once the standard two-month TB incubation period has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - Long Island</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOQ0VwbXBmQ0RXMC1kdUQ2TG91RzhSZk1XLU95REticnd1ZFc1ZThBNGlVSEN1RDFFNHRQOTdtYU1nOG96aXBzUXRoVEFlYzVjWEVHa2tUc3hnSHB2cGxWZDVZWU9lTHJjMExZcVZLTnpJVDZkRDlITGxfSl9FbWpmMmNrTFUwcFRCZkZUbkd0YjVOdkdLNE1JYzBPQlhzLWVlS1Y5Wm5nQWVoMDFsdGxlWnIxVkhtVVhfcThzbnM1eUFWMU0</guid></item><item><title>美国医学存在信任问题- BBC | American medicine has a trust problem - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOckdPU1cyRG1sWG93SXVrYnBmRG4tRUNqUWR2QlE5cmducUEzTDFtM0xTcktMa3BBblJDX21oZnc5NVVJZS1LOFdVei1PUUJuaFJwTC00S09vUUFMekFwYkp2Z0dEd2VpZDFJMENJSWUzUUZrY3BlbWN1MXpHMmUtQUZJc0t0R2pYOXR1UWJaSGVmelA5R3BaYjFNZ3dRcjE2MTFxSHhtMWx0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;American medicine has a trust problem&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC BBC Special Correspondent Katty Kay is shown speaking to Dr Leana Wen via video call.

There's the anti-vaccine community, who often distrust both America's health agencies and the big pharmaceutical companies. There are also the people who previously trusted health agencies, but are now sceptical of US President Donald Trump’s administration and are particularly wary of Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What does it mean for health outcomes when so many people don't believe in the doctors, drug companies and the public agencies who are there to treat us? What can be done to bring trust back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Our conversation was a weighty one – but I found Wen's suggestions about how to approach concerned parents and vaccine sceptics to be particularly insightful at this moment.

We are already seeing the single &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984vjl0gp2o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;largest measles outbreak in the US&lt;/a&gt; in the last 30 years. Measles has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;been eliminated&lt;/a&gt; since 2000, but the US could lose its measles elimination status. We are seeing rising cases of things like whooping cough. If vaccination rates for other diseases fall, we could also see a return of rubella and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240229-why-dont-some-countries-vaccinate-against-chickenpox" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;chickenpox&lt;/a&gt; and even polio – things that would really have been unthinkable just several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But if you have such distrust over vaccines, that also means that there's a distrust of authority, of science, of the scientific method, of what counts as science and how one does research. And that could have negative impacts on many other aspects of health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;Are there things that work for pulling people back into a position where they might have mistrusted medical authorities, but they can then say, 'OK, yes, I can trust authority. I can trust what science is telling me?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;The core aspect of being a physician is the one-on-one conversation with our patients, and it's in those one-on-one conversations that we see a lot of change, because we never approach these conversations with the assumption that 'I'm right and you're wrong' or that you must have listened to all these &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200522-what-we-can-learn-from-conspiracy-theories" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;. We come to those conversations asking people what their thoughts are, what they have heard, why they believe one thing or another – and then we meet them where they are in those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Often, that means that we have to overlook their opposition to vaccines, because we don't want to push them away so much. Then, they're now not willing to get treatment for their high blood pressure and diabetes, and then may go out and have a stroke. So, I think part of building that trust actually is knowing when to make the case and when not to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;It's not an option to get frustrated – Leana Wen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;If you were talking to parents of a young child who didn't want to get their child vaccinated against measles, [who are] afraid of measles vaccine and what it might do to their child, what would you say to them, doctor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;I think I would start by asking them some more questions about what it is that they are afraid of. Are they afraid of all vaccines, or are they just afraid of this one? What exactly is the concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the other hand, if what they're concerned about is all vaccines, because they don't believe that measles is that serious, then I would point to the reality about measles: that yes, it's true that most people who get measles will have a mild case of it, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one in five will have pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. One in 20 will end up being hospitalised. One to three out of a thousand children with measles &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;will die&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, I think it really depends on what those specific concerns are. But ultimately, the message is very straightforward: Vaccines are safe. They're effective. They're life-saving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;Do you think, in the environment we're living in, that it is sometimes impossible to persuade people because it's almost tribal? As somebody who is a scientist and a doctor, how personally frustrating is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;I think back to what the individual conversations with patients will look like, because it's not an option to get frustrated. And you could say, 'OK, we're not going to touch this subject for the time being, because we're not going to make headway'. And again, I don't want to drive you, the patient, away from all the other recommendations that are important for your health. If you don't see me as the doctor, maybe you'll go to somebody else who will take offense to what you're saying about vaccines and then you won't get any medical treatment. That's not a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I think it is reasonable to put aside certain differences and maybe try to approach it later and focus on areas of common ground. But I think that most of all, it's really important to not approach the individual who you don't agree with with scorn or scepticism or anger, because that's only going to elicit a defensive reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK:&lt;/b&gt; In April, after two small children &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;, Health [and Human Services] Secretary Robert F Kennedy &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99n18zlzg3o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;endorsed the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents measles. He then got attacked online from people who are in the anti-vax camp who were very disappointed that he had come out and endorsed the vaccine. A day later, he posted a photograph of himself with a couple of doctors who are opposed to vaccines, to the MMR vaccines. And he called them extraordinary healers. And he also promoted some unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, I'm quite confused about where the health secretary stands on vaccines. And I imagine if my kids were still young and I was at the stage where I was having to look at getting them vaccinated, I, as a parent, might be quite confused, as well. Are you clear about where the health secretary stands, particularly on the measles vaccine, given the outbreak of measles in the country at the moment? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;Yes, I am very clear on where RFK Jr stands, although I think that your interpretation of it is very fair and also very correct. You are confused because he intends for it to be confusing, because he is trying to speak to two very, very different constituencies who have completely opposing goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the one hand, RFK Jr is a well-known vaccine conspiracy theorist who, for dozens of years, founded and ran an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;anti-vaccine organisation&lt;/a&gt;. He's seen as a champion by people who head up the anti-vaccine movements themselves. So, that is a core constituency that got him into this role and he has to placate them. So, he's said many things that are very harmful and untrue. Playing down, for example, the seriousness of the measles infection, talking about treatments that are not treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To be clear, there is no specific antiviral that will cure measles. So, he talks about steroids and antibiotics and things that are not treatments for measles. In a way, that also plays down the seriousness of the disease – people mistakenly think that there is a treatment that there is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;At the same time, he continues to spread doubt about the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. He has said in recent weeks that it causes just as much illness as measles itself. He has continued to promote the debunked allegation that the MMR vaccine is tied to autism. He's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3egk3ygo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;announced research&lt;/a&gt; to study this conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, he's currently walking this line between trying to appease the anti-vaccine camp and trying to appease some people, including moderate Republicans, who are trying to get him to say things like, 'Well, the measles vaccine is a good thing'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, he's trying to say both of these things and that's why it comes out sounding confused, because that's, in fact, how he intends it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id='[in-a-statement-to-the-bbc,-vianca-n.-rodriguez-feliciano,-press-secretary-at-the-us-department-of-health-and-human-services,-said-that-the-department-is-committed-to-building-public-trust-in-science-and,-specifically,-"secretary-kennedy-is-not-anti-vaccine-–-he-is-pro-safety,-pro-transparency,-and-pro-accountability".' class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;[In a statement to the BBC, Vianca N.

Telomeres are protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age and are associated with chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over four years, those who took vitamin D experienced significantly less telomere shortening, equivalent to nearly three years of delayed aging, compared to those who took a placebo. These findings support vitamin D as a promising intervention to reduce age-related cellular decline, though more research is needed to confirm long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Aging Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin D3 supplementation slowed telomere shortening over 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants retained the equivalent of 3 extra years of telomere health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Effect from Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Omega-3 supplementation did not significantly impact telomere length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results from the VITAL randomized controlled trial reveal that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten during aging and are linked to the development of certain diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new report, which is published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, is based on data from a VITAL sub-study co-led by researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia, and supports a promising role in slowing a pathway for biological aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, MD, principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are made of repeating sequences of DNA, or base pairs, that prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes. Telomere shortening is a natural part of aging and is associated with an increased risk of various age-related diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few short-term, small-scale studies have suggested that vitamin D or omega 3 fatty acid supplementation may help support telomeres, but results have been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and omega 3 fatty acid (1 g/day) supplementation that tracked U.S. females aged 55 years and older and males aged 50 years and older for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VITAL Telomere sub-study included 1,054 of these participants, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and at Year 2 and Year 4.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with taking placebo, taking vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening over four years, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging compared with placebo. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation had no significant effect on telomere length throughout follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, PhD, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Manson, Mass General Brigham authors include Nancy R.

We hypothesized that vitamin D or n-3 FAs supplementation reduce leukocyte telomere length (LTL) attrition overtime by leveraging the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2,000 IU/day) and marine n-3 FAs (1 g/day) supplements for 5 years among a representative sample of 25,871 US females ≥55 and males ≥50 years of age. The VITAL Telomere study (NCT04386577) included 1054 participants who were evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was determined by the Absolute Human Telomere Length Quantification quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. The pre-specified primary outcome measures were changes in LTL between baseline, Year 2 and Year 4. Analyses of intervention effect used mixed-effects linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was measured in a total of 2,571 samples from the 1031 participants at baseline, year 2, and year 4. Compared to placebo, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation significantly decreased LTL attrition by 0.14 kilo base pairs (kb) (0.01, 0.27) over 4 years (p = 0.039).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall trend analysis showed that the vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation group had LTLs that were about 0.035 kb higher per year of follow-up compared to placebo group (0.002, 0.07, p=0.037). Marine n-3 FAs supplementation had no significant effect on LTL at either year 2 or year 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-years of supplementation with 2000 IU/day vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reduced telomere attrition by 140 bp, suggesting that vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; daily supplementation with or without n-3 FAs might have a role in counteracting telomere erosion or cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:57:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBCU3lpcUVYLUxNYm5nR0hPUC04aHBISllxNGZqY1dTOWJ0aFZKR0hYRElydzBoUU1HdnlJVXVhZVB6aXZMQ3daQ1BRQnlWQlpLaGpPUWQ5NzFuOGtiOTcyTU9MRWVGSG5GQnhXdEV3</guid></item><item><title>FDA扩大新冠肺炎疫苗接种的心脏风险警告- Axios | FDA expands warnings of heart risks on COVID shots - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFBmeEROOXAta2xKVURtaTN4NG1oaUxsNWh1LWt4MXJwSTBLTmR4V3EwdVIzUzBzSVV5R1RFZGtNNWNVbEcwVm9IYzNTMG1HUDV4YWoyRnJ0R0hQMHVnOXNEd2d1b3dodTVzcUNfbg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:42:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBmeEROOXAta2xKVURtaTN4NG1oaUxsNWh1LWt4MXJwSTBLTmR4V3EwdVIzUzBzSVV5R1RFZGtNNWNVbEcwVm9IYzNTMG1HUDV4YWoyRnJ0R0hQMHVnOXNEd2d1b3dodTVzcUNfbg</guid></item><item><title>与儿童推理技能相关的微小大脑褶皱-神经科学新闻 | Tiny Brain Folds Linked to Reasoning Skills in Children - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE02dlhmYi1qNFpydTRBR3hNczhvWUx4WHJCLTdxS3RBVVE0SWV4akdiQkxnRnlqZFlrWmlaRHUtREVBa1V0WGpRN0NCSUJWSEd5bnF2WkluTHRCaW5Cd0JnYms2YTAyZVRNZVpIMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that small, shallow grooves in the human brain—called tertiary sulci—are closely tied to reasoning ability and brain connectivity in children and adolescents.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published May 19 in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, University of California, Berkeley, researchers show that in children and adolescents, the depths of some small grooves are correlated with increased connectivity between regions of the brain — the lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex — involved in reasoning and other high-level cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grooves may actually bring those areas closer together in space, shortening the connections between them and speeding communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication, the researchers say, is that variability in these small grooves, which are called tertiary sulci (pronounced sul’-sigh), may help explain individual differences in cognitive performance, and could serve as diagnostic indicators or biomarkers of reasoning ability or neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The impetus for this study was having seen that sulcal depth correlated with reasoning across children and adolescents,” said Silvia Bunge, professor of psychology and a member of UC Berkeley’s Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given our previous findings, our former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen aimed to test if sulcal depth was correlated with reasoning performance and to test if patterns of coordinated activity within a lateral prefrontal-parietal network could explain this relation between sulcal depth and reasoning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had explicit predictions about which tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex would be functionally connected to tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, and that panned out,” added Kevin Weiner, UC Berkeley associate professor of psychology and of neuroscience and a member of HWNI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prefrontal and parietal cortices aside, the hypothesis is that the formation of sulci leads to shortened distances between connected brain regions, which could lead to increased neural efficiency, and then, in turn, individual differences in improved cognition with translational applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cortex is sort of haphazardly crunched up into the brain — that’s what I was always taught,” Bunge said. “Kevin came along and changed my mind about sulci.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hills and valleys of the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of most animals, mammals included, have smooth surfaces. Primates have hills and valleys covering their cerebral cortex. While one group of primates, the New World monkeys called marmosets, have shallow, barely perceptible sulci, those of humans are deeply incised, with between 60% and 70% of the cortex buried in these folds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortical folding patterns in humans also change with age, establishing their final structure late in prenatal development while becoming less prominent in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While sulci can change over development, getting deeper or shallower and developing thinner or thicker gray matter — probably in ways that depend on experience — our particular configuration of sulci is a stable individual difference: their size, shape, location and even, for a few sulci, whether they’re present or absent,” said Bunge, who studies abstract reasoning in young people, from 6 years of age through young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smallest grooves, many of which are uniquely human, are called tertiary sulci because they appear last in prenatal development and are never as deep as the major or primary sulci that are most evident on the cerebral surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have speculated that the tertiary sulci emerge in parts of the human brain that have expanded the most throughout evolution and have a protracted development, and that they are likely associated with aspects of cognition — reasoning, decision-making, planning and self-control — that develop over a protracted adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prior to this study, evidence was lacking for a connection between tertiary sulci and brain connectivity. The UC Berkeley study is one of few, all within the past few years, to provide such proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sulci linked to cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner and Bunge said that, as undergraduates, they were never taught how to define tertiary sulci; they often examined scans of average brains that did not match any specific individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner noticed this mismatch as an undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the time, all I knew was that I had some cortical squiggles that weren’t in the average brain atlases that we had in the lab. So the question I asked my mentors, Sabine Kastner and Charlie Gross, was: Do I have different structures that aren’t in our atlases or are structures missing from these atlases?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sent me down a 15-year rabbit hole studying one particular tertiary sulcus in the visual cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work showed that a specific sulcus, the mid-fusiform sulcus, varied in length from as small as 3 millimeters to as long as 7 centimeters in any given person. Moreover, the longer the sulcus, the better a person was at processing and recognizing human faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 2% of individuals have developmental prosopagnosia, which means they can’t perceive faces, and they don’t have any brain damage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sulcus, especially in the right hemisphere, is shorter and shallower in those folks than in what we refer to as neurotypical controls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on that rabbit hole, Bunge and Weiner wondered whether tertiary sulci in other regions of the brain, outside the visual processing units, also correlated with cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon moving to UC Berkeley in 2018, Weiner began investigating the prefrontal cortex — located in the front of the brain behind the forehead — in collaboration with Bunge, who wanted to test whether sulci in this area would be linked to reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 paper, the two collaborated to define all the smaller sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex and created a computer model that identified the tertiary sulci as contributing the most variation in reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The model identified that there’s tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex that are contributing to reasoning skills in kids,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding on that work in the new study, Weiner, Bunge and their colleagues painstakingly catalogued the tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, located under and just behind the crown of the skull, and investigated its functional connections with the sulci of the lateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both studies, they studied 43 participants, 20 of them female, who ranged in age from 7 to 18. While in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, the participants were given a reasoning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the brain activity in 21 sulci they had identified in each hemisphere of the brain, and the functional connections between these sulci — including, for the first time, tertiary sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these individuals, greater depth for several of the sulci implicated in reasoning was associated with higher network centrality across the set of prefrontal and parietal sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience affects sulci&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bunge pointed out that the association between depths of sulci and reasoning does not hold for all sulci, and that sulcal depth may change with experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do we think that an individual’s capacity for reasoning is set in stone based on their cortical folding? No!,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive function depends on variability in a variety of anatomical and functional features and, importantly, we know that experience, like quality of schooling, plays a powerful role in shaping an individual’s cognitive trajectory, and that it is malleable, even in adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner’s lab is creating a computer program to help researchers identify tertiary sulci in the human brain. Most programs only identify about 35 sulci, but when tertiary sulci are included, there are over 100, he said, including new ones that their labs have uncovered together. They argue that sulci could serve as landmarks to compare brains between individuals, since brains vary so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dozens of brain maps have been proposed in just the last five years, but they disagree about the areas of associated regions in the cortex, and there are mismatches between areas at the group and individual level,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Examining network architecture based on individual sulcal morphology circumvents these disagreements and mismatches, with the opportunity to glean network-level insight from the local sulcal anatomy that is specific to a given individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Bunge and Weiner, other UC Berkeley co-authors of the paper are former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen, former graduate student Willa Voorhies, former undergraduates Ethan Willbrand and Jewelia Yao, and former visiting scholars Yi-Heng Tsai and Thomas Gagnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R21HD100858) and the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH133637), and the National Science Foundation (CAREER Award 2042251).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bac8d6c9dbd4dedfc8c9fad8dfc8d1dfd6dfc394dfdecf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Sanders – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0726-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/a&gt;” by Silvia Bunge et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our understanding of the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior is still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (Voorhies et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings beg the question: what is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) in participants from the same sample as our previous study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, total of 1806) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7–18 years (20 female). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, we found that 1) the connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated – and more accurately than rotated sulcal labels equated for size and shape; 2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; 3) sulci clustered together into groups with similar patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and 4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be relevant for functional connectivity, and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:38:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE02dlhmYi1qNFpydTRBR3hNczhvWUx4WHJCLTdxS3RBVVE0SWV4akdiQkxnRnlqZFlrWmlaRHUtREVBa1V0WGpRN0NCSUJWSEd5bnF2WkluTHRCaW5Cd0JnYms2YTAyZVRNZVpIMA</guid></item></channel></rss>
