Her doctors put it down to a rare disorder she had that caused her lungs to become chronically inflamed. "No worry, it must be that," she was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;When she finally had an X-ray, a shadow was detected on her lung. "That set the ball rolling," Martha recalls. "First, a CT scan was done, then a bronchoscopy [a procedure that involves using a long tube to inspect the airways in a person's lungs] to take tissue samples." After the tumour was removed, about four months after she'd first reported symptoms to her GP, she received the diagnosis: &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/lung-cancer/stages-types-grades/stage-3" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Stage IIIA lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The tumour had infiltrated the surrounding lymph nodes but had not yet spread to distant organs. Martha was 59 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was a total shock," says Martha. Although she would occasionally light up a cigarette at a party, she never considered herself a smoker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/lung-cancer-statistics/#:~:text=Lung%20cancer%20is%20the%20most,most%20common%20cancer%20in%20women." class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most common cancer worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lung-cancer" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;leading cause of cancer death&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gco.iarc.who.int/media/globocan/factsheets/populations/900-world-fact-sheet.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In 2022&lt;/a&gt;, about 2.5 million people were diagnosed with the disease and more than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/en/dataviz/pie?mode=population&amp;amp;group_populations=0&amp;amp;cancers=15&amp;amp;types=1" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;1.8 million&lt;/a&gt; died. Although tobacco-related lung cancers still account for the majority of diagnoses worldwide, smoking rates have been &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/16-01-2024-tobacco-use-declines-despite-tobacco-industry-efforts-to-jeopardize-progress" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;declining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833289" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;for several decades&lt;/a&gt;. As the number of smokers continues to fall in many countries around the world, the proportion of lung cancer occurring in people who have never smoked is on the rise. Between &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/lung-cancer-never-smokers" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;10 and 20%&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer diagnoses are now made in individuals who have never smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Lung cancer in never-smokers is emerging as a separate disease entity with distinct molecular characteristics that directly impact treatment decisions and outcomes," says Andreas Wicki, an oncologist at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. While the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38195910/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;average age at diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is similar to that of smoking-related lung cancers, younger patients with lung cancer are more likely to have never smoked. "When we see 30- or 35-year-olds with lung cancer, they are usually never-smokers," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another difference is the type of cancer being diagnosed. Until the 1950s and 1960s, the most common form of lung cancer was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8639747" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;squamous cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt; – a type which begins with the cells that line the lungs. In contrast, lung cancer in never-smokers is almost exclusively &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519578/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;adenocarcinoma&lt;/a&gt; – a type which starts in mucus-producing cells – which is now the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00428-4/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;most common form&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer in both smokers and never-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Like other forms of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage. "If there's a 1cm (0.4in) tumour hidden somewhere in your lungs, you won't notice it," says Wicki. The early symptoms, which include persistent coughing, chest pain, shortness of breath or wheezing, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4375-lung-cancer" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;often only appear&lt;/a&gt; when the tumour is larger or has spread. In addition, the historically strong link between smoking and lung cancer may inadvertently lead non-smokers to attribute symptoms to other causes, says Wicki. "Most cases in never-smokers are therefore only diagnosed at stage 3 or 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglsvb.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The smoke from cooking fuel and fumes from cooking oil can increase a person's risk of lung disease, including lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;The smoke from cooking fuel and fumes from cooking oil can increase a person's risk of lung disease, including lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer in never-smokers is also more common in women. Women who have never smoked are more than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://go2.org/wp-content/uploads/GO2-WLC-Facts-0823.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to develop lung cancer as male never-smokers. Aside from &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/why-is-there-an-increase-in-lung-cancer-among-women-who-have-never-smoked-249406" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lung anatomy and environmental exposures&lt;/a&gt;, at least part of the answer may lie in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00175-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt; that are more common in women, especially in Asian women. One of the most prevalent is a mutation known as EGFR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Lung cancer cells in people who have never smoked usually have a number of mutations that could be causing their cancer, explains Wicki – so-called driver mutations. These &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/lung-cancer/symptoms-diagnosis/biomarker-testing/egfr" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;genetic changes drive tumour growth&lt;/a&gt;, such as the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1568026620666200303123102" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;EGFR&lt;/a&gt; gene which codes for a protein on the surface of cells and is called epidermal growth factor receptor. The reasons why these driver mutations are more frequently found in female patients, particularly those of Asian descent, are not entirely understood. There is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3391698/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8524770/#sec12-15353702211019697" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;female hormones&lt;/a&gt; may play a role, with certain genetic variants that affect oestrogen metabolism being more prevalent in East Asians. This could potentially explain the higher incidence of EGFR-mutant lung cancer in Asian women, although the data is very preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Following the discovery of mutations which can lead to lung cancer in non-smokers, the pharmaceutical industry began to develop drugs that specifically block the activity of those proteins. For example, the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://scholarworks.indianapolis.iu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/46cb7e85-0b8b-46d3-b5b2-fecd68c8b3e1/content" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;first EGFR inhibitors&lt;/a&gt; became available around 20 years ago and most patients showed an impressive response. However, treatment often led to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2670612/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;resistant cancer cells&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in tumour relapse. In recent years, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-024-00971-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;much effort&lt;/a&gt; has been put into overcoming this problem, with &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39366135/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;newer types of drugs&lt;/a&gt; now entering the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As a result, the prognosis for patients has steadily improved. "The median survival rate of patients who carry such driver mutations is now several years," Wicki explains. "We have patients who have been on targeted therapy for more than 10 years. This is a huge step forward when you consider that the median survival rate was less than 12 months about 20 years ago." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As the proportion of lung cancer in never-smokers increases, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44276-023-00006-w" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;experts say&lt;/a&gt; it is crucial to develop prevention strategies for this population. A number of risk factors have been implicated. For example, studies have revealed that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9264880/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;radon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4126868/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;second-hand smoke&lt;/a&gt; can elevate the risk of lung cancer in non-smokers. Additionally, exposure to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4232458/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;cooking fumes&lt;/a&gt; or to stoves burning wood or coal in poorly ventilated rooms may also increase this risk. Since women traditionally spend more time indoors, they are particularly vulnerable to this type of indoor air pollution. However, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7904962/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;outdoor air pollution&lt;/a&gt; is an even more significant factor in the development of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250529-103858-de9d27ef1-web-2.22.3-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lglt70.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Particulate air pollution can increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Particulate air pollution can increase a person's risk of developing lung cancer (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In fact, outdoor air pollution is the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtho.2023.05.024" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;second leading cause of all lung cancer cases&lt;/a&gt; after smoking. Studies have revealed that people who &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-025-02999-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;live in highly polluted areas&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to die of lung cancer than those who do not. Particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (about a 30th of the width of a human hair), typically found in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10543654/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;vehicle exhaust&lt;/a&gt; and fossil fuel smoke, seems to play an important role. And intriguingly,  &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.esmo.org/press-releases/scientists-discover-how-air-pollution-may-trigger-lung-cancer-in-never-smokers" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;research has shown&lt;/a&gt; a strong link between high levels of PM2.5 and lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked and who carry an EGFR mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;At least one study has shown an association between wildfire exposure and increased incidence of lung cancer – Christine Berg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;How air pollution may trigger lung cancer in never-smokers carrying the EGFR mutation has been the focus of research at the Francis Crick Institute in London. "When we think about environmental carcinogens, we usually think about them as causing mutations in the DNA", says William Hill, a post-doctoral researcher in the cancer evolution and genome instability laboratory of the Francis Crick Institute. Cigarette smoke, for example, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6546629/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;damages our DNA&lt;/a&gt;, thus leading to lung cancer. "However, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37020004/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;our [2023] study&lt;/a&gt; proposes that PM2.5 doesn't directly mutate DNA, rather it wakes up dormant mutant cells sitting in our lungs and starts them on the early stages of lung cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In their experiments, the researchers showed that air pollutants are taken up by immune cells called macrophages. These cells normally protect the lung by ingesting infectious organisms. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10213952/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In response to PM2.5 exposure&lt;/a&gt;, macrophages release chemical messengers known as cytokines, which wake up cells carrying the EGFR mutation and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-024-00175-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;causes them to proliferate&lt;/a&gt;. "Both air pollution and EGFR mutations are needed for tumours to grow," says Hill. Understanding how PM2.5 acts on the microenvironment of cells carrying EGFR mutations to promote tumour growth, he adds, could pave the way for new approaches to preventing lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The association between air pollution and lung cancer is not new.

But the effect of changes on lung cancer rates has not yet become apparent. "It probably takes 15 to 20 years for changes in exposure to be reflected in lung cancer rates, but we don't know for sure," says Christine Berg, a retired oncologist from the National Cancer Institute in Maryland, US. Moreover, the picture is not static: climate change is likely to have an impact in the future. "With the increasing risk of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21708-0" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, air pollution and PM2.5 levels are rising again in certain regions of the US," says Berg. "At least &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519622000675" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown an association between wildfire exposure and increased incidence of lung cancer.

"But 99% of the world population lives in areas where air pollution levels exceed [these updated] WHO guideline limits," says Ganfeng Luo, a postdoctoral researcher at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00428-4/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, IARC researchers estimated that approximately 194,000 cases of lung adenocarcinoma worldwide were attributable to PM2.5 in 2022.

"But not all of these cases will be in never-smokers," says Harriet Rumgay, an epidemiologist and a co-author of the study. Adenocarcinoma also occurs in smokers, especially in those using filtered cigarettes. "There's still a lot we don't know," says Rumgay. "More research is needed to disentangle the different factors and also to understand, for example, how long you would need to be exposed to air pollution before developing lung cancer." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As treatments continue to improve, lung cancer in never-smokers is becoming more survivable.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gut health is a key component of healthy aging and has been linked with benefits for longevity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Habits like excessive alcohol intake, not getting enough sleep and limited physical activity can take a toll on gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic stress and eating a diet with limited diversity may also be aging your gut prematurely.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-after-5-pm-for-healthy-aging-11712308" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, supporting your gut microbiome is a crucial piece of the puzzle. In fact, growing research suggests that a healthy, diverse microbiome may be an important predictor of longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  While the gut microbiome is surprisingly adaptable, some common day-to-day habits can collectively take a toll on your gut, causing it to age faster. Read on to find out what habits experts say may be aging your gut—and what to do instead.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Having a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diverse microbiome&lt;/a&gt;—aka a variety of beneficial gut microorganisms—is essential for a healthy gut. And one of the best ways to achieve this is by eating a varied diet filled with minimally processed, whole foods, especially &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based ones&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests that including five different servings of plants on your plate each day may improve your long-term health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A variety of fiber foods means that you’ll also benefit from getting a wide variety of nutrients,” says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Amanda Sauceda MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lack of variety may also be a factor in why the Standard American Diet (SAD) is linked with poor gut health outcomes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Not only is SAD typically low in fiber, but it tends to be high in processed foods, which aren’t as nutrient-rich as their whole-food counterparts. “Inevitably this pattern of eating, over time, has been shown to alter the gut microbiome (complex ecosystem of microbes in our gut), in ways that can lead to inflammation,” explains &lt;a href="https://wholeisticliving.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jenna Volpe RDN, LD, CLT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This unchecked inflammation can age your gut and increase your risk of chronic disease.

Grazing Rather Than Eating Meals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some individuals get into the habit of grazing through the day rather than eating meals. This frequent snacking and even late-night eating can age the gut. Our gut needs periods of rest to clean and repair itself” says &lt;a href="https://www.oswalddigestiveclinic.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marcie Vaske MS LN CNS&lt;/a&gt;. More specifically, we need to give our body the chance for the migrating motor complex (MMC) to turn on between meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The MMC is essentially like a motorized intestinal broom, creating a downward wave-like motion responsible for sweeping the debris (such as microbes) down and out of our small intestine. A full cycle of MMC activity takes about 4 to 5 hours,” explains Volpe. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Frequent grazing, or even consuming sweetened beverages throughout the day, turns off the MMC, so it doesn't get a chance to effectively sweep out the intestines. Over time, this spells trouble since it may increase the risk of developing small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), bloating and more.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Per Volpe, allowing 3–4 hours between each meal or snack (and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/drink-to-limit-to-live-longer-11708703" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;avoiding sugary beverages&lt;/a&gt;) is optimal for healthy gut motility.

It’s not just a coincidence. “Stress isn’t just in your head, your gut feels it too,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nutritionbyjulie.net/meetjulie" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Julie Balsamo MS, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, stress can age your gut in more ways than one.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Stress can impact gut motility and hypersensitivity (through the brain-gut axis). It can also disrupt the intestinal epithelial barrier function and trigger immune responses of the gut. Finally, it can alter the gut microbiome and cause dysbiosis. All of these changes can increase the risk and severity of both functional and inflammatory GI disorders and in turn age the gut,” explains &lt;a href="https://gastrohealth.com/physicians/asma-p-khapra-md" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Asma Khapra&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re familiar with gut health, then you’re likely not surprised to see fiber on this list. “[Eating more fiber] is the most basic thing we can do for our gut, but with 90% of people not meeting fiber recommendations it’s the one area that almost everyone can improve on” says Sauceda. Your gut &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/283531/top-fiber-rich-foods-for-good-gut-bacteria/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;needs dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; to perform at its best.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Without enough fiber, your good gut bacteria don’t have the fuel they need to thrive, and the protective mucus lining in your gut can start to break down. That leaves your digestive system more vulnerable to inflammation, irritation, and early decline,” explains &lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Simpson RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tummy troubles happen, but if they’re persistent, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-you-should-see-a-gastroenterologist-11715186" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;it’s time to visit a gut health professional&lt;/a&gt;. “If you experience gut issues and make the decision to ignore them…you may be aging your gut. Gas, bloating, reflux, diarrhea and constipation are not ‘normal.’ When left untreated, these symptoms can signal deeper issues like dysbiosis, leaky gut or even enzyme deficiencies. Over time, all of them can worsen and age your gut if not addressed,” says Vaske.

Forgetting About Fermented Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fermented foods have a few special qualities for your gut that help it from aging,” says Sauceda. She adds, “One of the unique benefits of fermented foods is that they can have increased digestibility and nutrient bioavailability.” &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Fermented foods&lt;/a&gt; like yogurt, kombucha and kimchi are also a source of probiotics.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  “It’s thought that the bacteria found in fermented foods could help with maintaining your gut barrier and with inflammation,” explains Sauceda. Make it a habit to stock your fridge with fermented foods and add them to your meals regularly. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Antibiotics can be lifesaving, but overusing them, especially for things that might not need them, can do real damage to your gut. They don’t just kill the bad bacteria; they wipe out the good ones too, leaving your microbiome depleted and more prone to inflammation and imbalance,” says Simpson. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to antibiotics, several over-the-counter medications may also prematurely age your gut with long-term use. “Medications like ibuprofen or acid blockers can offer short-term relief. However, long-term use can worsen digestive symptoms by irritating the gut lining, lowering stomach acid (which you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; for proper digestion) and disrupting microbiome balance,” explains Balsamo.
&lt;/p&gt;

Not Prioritizing Physical Activity &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we normally associate exercise with heart health, it can also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8017087/things-you-should-do-every-day-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; in more ways than one. Exercise not only strengthens the muscles in your abs, arms and legs—your gut muscles benefit, too. Stronger gut muscles means your gut can move waste faster and more efficiently. On the flip side, when you are less physically active, so are your gut muscles. Exercise may also have positive effects on your gut microbiome. Research shows that folks who regularly exercise tend to have a better balance of good microbes in their gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-9-drinking-too-much-alcohol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 9. Drinking Too Much Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grabbing an occasional drink with a friend to unwind after a long week is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on your gut health. However, excess alcohol intake can &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960653/ways-drinking-alcohol-affects-your-bowel-movements-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;have more serious consequences&lt;/a&gt;, causing your gut to age faster. This is because alcohol &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-inflammation-8415778" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;increases chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the gut. When alcohol is broken down, it releases toxins that may damage the intestinal lining, weakening its defenses against pathogens and contributing to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-leaky-gut-syndrome-8421526" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;“leaky” gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Alcohol can also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8070932/drinking-alcohol-effect-on-gut-microbiome-according-to-gastroenterologist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;change the composition of your gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; tipping the scales in favor of more “bad” bacteria. That said, be mindful of how much and how often you consume alcohol as it impacts not just gut health but your risk of other diseases as well.

Skipping Out on Adequate Sleep &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you regularly clocking the recommended 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night? If not, it may be time to reassess your sleep habits. Your gut is also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877347/your-gut-health-could-affect-how-well-you-sleep-according-to-new-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;closely connected with your sleep quality&lt;/a&gt; via the gut-brain axis. In fact, research suggests that sleep and your gut health are a two way street.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A more diverse microbiome supports better sleep while poor sleep can disrupt the health of your microbiome. So if you’re regularly missing out on adequate shut eye, that could be aging your gut.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you treat your gut well, it will return the favor. While not meeting your fiber needs or skipping out on sleep is OK on occasion, it can be hard for your gut to keep up when they become regular occurrences. Over the course of years, the damage caused by one or more of the habits highlighted above can start to age your gut prematurely. The good news? It’s never too late to start ditching these common habits for healthier ones to turn back the clock on your gut health.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The number of people being diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ASD)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd"&gt;attention deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span&gt;(ADHD)&lt;/span&gt; has risen sharply in recent decades, and research continues to look at factors involved in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in 2023 revealed there's a difference in how children with &lt;span&gt;autism&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; clear the common plastic compound bisphenol A (BPA), compared to neurotypical children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA is used in a lot of plastics and plastic production processes, and can also be found inside food and drink cans. However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hormone-disrupting-chemical-detected-in-90-of-europeans-research-shows"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has also linked it to health issues involving hormone disruption, including breast  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="163645" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150231" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642.jpg" alt="plastic water bottles" class="wp-image-150231 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/plastic_water_bottles_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150231" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plastic bottles can contain the additive bisphenol A. (&lt;a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/bottles-plastic-recycling-4276208/"&gt;fotoblend/pixabay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Rowan University and Rutgers University in the US looked at three groups of children: 66 with &lt;span&gt;autism&lt;/span&gt;, 46 with &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;, and 37 neurotypical kids. In particular, they analyzed the process of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronidation"&gt;glucuronidation&lt;/a&gt;, a chemical process the body uses to clear out toxins within the blood through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that kids with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; couldn't clear out BPA and another similar compound called &lt;a href="https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/1750368/"&gt;diethylhexyl phthalate&lt;/a&gt; (DEHP) with as much efficiency as other kids, potentially leading to longer exposure to their toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Detoxification of these two plasticizers is compromised in children with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper. "Consequently, their tissues are more exposed to these two plasticizers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only in the case of BPA that the difference was  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/p-value" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73101" data-postid="163645" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;statistically significant&lt;/a&gt; though: the efficiency was reduced by about 11 percent for kids with &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and 17 percent for kids with &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt;, compared with the control group of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think that gene mutations in certain individuals mean that BPA can't be cleared as well as it needs to be, which means the substance sticks around in the body. That potentially could cause damage in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-brain-reveals-the-genetic-origins-of-autism-spectrum-disorder"&gt;neuron development&lt;/a&gt; and operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_150233" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-150233" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642.jpg" alt="neuron image" class="wp-image-150233 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/generic_neuron_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-150233" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Inability to clear BPA in some individuals could affect the development of their neurons.

However, it's only part of the story – not every child with a neurodevelopmental disorder had problems flushing out BPA, so there are other factors at play, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work is continuing to identify how exactly &lt;span&gt;ASD&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;ADHD&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adhd-presents-in-different-forms-which-scientists-still-can-t-fully-explain"&gt;develop in people&lt;/a&gt; – whether it's in utero before birth for example, or later on in life – as the data isn't enough to show whether BPA exposure causes either disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is an extensive body of &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)33004-1/fulltext"&gt;epidemiological evidence&lt;/a&gt; for a relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and environmental pollutants such as plasticizers," &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the researchers &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How important plasticizer originated neurodevelopmental disorder is in the overall occurrence of these disorders is not known, but it must account for a significant proportion or would not have been so easy to detect in a metabolic study of moderate size such as this study."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0289841"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article was first published in October 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taurine — an amino acid found in some foods and also made by the human body — has been shown to slow aging in animals when given as a supplement, raising the idea that it might be a promising anti-aging treatment for people. But now, a new study has raised questions about taurine's relationship to aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published Thursday (June 5) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2116?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23093234137653293603044630514166490186%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1749142451" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2116?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D23093234137653293603044630514166490186%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1749142451" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, measured taurine in the blood of three groups of people across adulthood, as well as in the blood of adult monkeys and mice. Some previous studies found that circulating taurine declines with age, which could help explain why taurine supplements improve certain signs of aging while extending lifespan — at least in lab animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those previous studies had limitations, though. For example, most were "cross-sectional" — meaning rather than tracking the same organisms through time, they looked at many, different-aged organisms at one point in time. This approach has produced conflicting results, with different papers reporting either a decline, increase or stability in taurine levels with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To gain clarity, the new study included both cross-sectional and longitudinal data, the latter of which included blood samples taken at different time points from the same groups of people and lab animals as they aged. Ultimately, what the scientists found is that taurine didn't decline with age; instead, it increased or stayed stable across all of the groups studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the differences in taurine levels seen between individuals "generally is far greater" than the degree of change seen across adulthood, study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1631764/network" target="_blank" data-url="https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/1631764/network" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maria Emilia Fernandez&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Institute on Aging (NIA), said at a June 3 news conference. Thus, low taurine is "unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The main takeaway is that a decline in taurine is not a universal feature of aging," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8216891" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p8216891" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joseph Baur&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of physiology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/human-aging-accelerates-dramatically-at-age-44-and-60" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/human-aging-accelerates-dramatically-at-age-44-and-60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human aging accelerates dramatically at age 44 and 60&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the amino acid may still be tied to some age-related changes in the body, he told Live Science in an email, adding that, "given that other studies have shown benefits, including lifespan extension in mice, I think the case remains to explore the potential for taurine supplementation to improve health." That said, the new study doesn't make a strong case for or against the therapeutic value of taurine supplements, he clarified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="there-is-a-discrepancy-3"&gt;"There is a discrepancy"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study included data from more than 740 participants in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/labs/blsa" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/labs/blsa" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who were between 26 and 100 years old. It also included data from over 70 people ages 20 to 85 who participated in the Balearic Islands Study of Aging, conducted in Mallorca, as well as data from about 160 people ages 20 to 68 in the Predictive Medicine Research cohort in Atlanta. The team also analyzed blood from rhesus macaques (&lt;em&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/em&gt;) ages 3 to 32 and blood from lab mice ages 9 to 27 months old, roughly covering the ages from reproductive maturity to old age and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most of these cohorts, "taurine exhibited an increase with age," Fernandez said. The only exceptions were male mice from one arm of the study and men from the Predictive Medicine Research group, both of which showed stable taurine levels through time. Scientists don't know why those two groups diverged from the overall trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated whether taurine levels showed any association with health metrics that change with age, such as muscle strength. But the connections they found were "inconsistent within and across cohorts," undermining the idea that low taurine levels drive such age-related changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This aspect of the study wasn't exhaustive, though. For instance, a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/amino-acid-taurine-can-slow-aging-in-animals-but-we-dont-know-if-it-works-in-people" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/amino-acid-taurine-can-slow-aging-in-animals-but-we-dont-know-if-it-works-in-people"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 study of taurine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that supplementing taurine in middle-aged mice was linked to better sugar metabolism and less-extensive DNA damage in the animals, but the new study didn't look at these other aspects of aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating the picture of what taurine does in health and disease, concentrations of the amino acid are known to differ among people with different medical conditions. For instance, people with obesity show lower taurine concentrations compared with people of lower weights, but when you cross the threshold into severe obesity, you see taurine surge, the study authors noted. In cancer, taurine goes up in leukemia but down in breast cancer, Fernandez added at the news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at baseline, taurine plays many roles in the healthy body, serving as a key component of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549765/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549765/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bile salts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are compounds made by the liver that help the body digest fat. It also helps boost the body's supply of antioxidants and build key proteins in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/50679-mitochondria.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/50679-mitochondria.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mitochondria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the powerhouses of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking all this complexity into account, can taurine levels be a proxy for anything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The short answer is no — it's not a reliable biomarker of anything yet," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/rafael-de-cabo" target="_blank" data-url="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/rafael-de-cabo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rafael de Cabo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Translational Gerontology Branch at NIA, said at the news conference. "I think that we need to be digging into the basic mechanisms … before it can be used reliably as a marker."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, given that there are existing studies that suggest taurine plays some part in aging, scientists still see value in studying it further. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sites.google.com/view/systems-biology-of-aging-lab/projects?authuser=0" target="_blank" data-url="https://sites.google.com/view/systems-biology-of-aging-lab/projects?authuser=0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vijay Yadav&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School who co-authored the 2023 taurine study, is involved in an ongoing clinical trial to see if daily taurine supplements have any effect on aging in middle-aged humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This trial, we hope, will generate sufficiently rigorous data to show — or not — whether supplementation delays the pace of aging in humans [or] increases health and fitness," he said at the news conference. For now, though, Yadav said there isn't clinical evidence yet to support taking taurine for anti-aging purposes, and the authors of the new study agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/luigi-ferrucci" target="_blank" data-url="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/luigi-ferrucci" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Luigi Ferrucci&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of the new study and scientific director at the NIA, said he thinks further study of the role of taurine in aging could reveal promising new avenues for treatment, even if those don't end up being taurine supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a discrepancy between different studies, and this discrepancy needs to be analyzed more in depth," Ferrucci said at the news conference. "They may reveal some important mechanisms with aging that could be … a target for intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT-wwMuzqbrUEHcHD5OxtIhZgRnD6DIeoJ5" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-ekqPEvysQahdmtcrKk8uRT-wwMuzqbrUEHcHD5OxtIhZgRnD6DIeoJ5 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The racial and ethnic groups people identify with may not accurately represent their genetic backgrounds or ancestries, a new study of people in the United States suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discrepancy between people's self-reported identities and their genetics is important for scientists to acknowledge as they strive to develop medical treatments tailored to different patients, the researchers behind the study say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This paper is very important because it clarifies at the highest resolution the relationship between genomic diversity and racial/ethnic categories in the US," said study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ufmg.br/ieat/residentes/eduardo-martin-tarazona-santos/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ufmg.br/ieat/residentes/eduardo-martin-tarazona-santos/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eduardo Tarazona-Santos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human population genetics at the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are "critical to develop appropriate precision medicine solutions for all," he told Live Science in an email.

This trove of data has been compiled through a National Institutes of Health program aimed at advancing precision medicine by recruiting people from diverse and underrepresented populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, many large-scale genetics studies have predominantly included people of European ancestry, making efforts like the All of Us project crucial for reducing medical inequity.

They also used genetic catalogs that contain DNA samples from all over the world, such as the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Project-Collection/1000-Genomes-Project" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.coriell.org/1/NHGRI/Collections/1000-Genomes-Project-Collection/1000-Genomes-Project" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1000 Genomes Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as a way to assess how people's genetic ancestry compared with the racial (white, Black or African American, Asian American) and ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino or not) categories used in the All of Us questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who identified as being from the same racial and ethnic groups had a number of genetic differences, the team found. In fact, "most genetic variance is within race and ethnicity groups rather than between groups," the study authors wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than sorting people into "distinct clusters" divided by racial and ethnic lines, the analyses found that people within different races and ethnicities show "gradients" of genetic variation. "We found gradients of genetic variation that cut across those categories," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study's findings counter a controversial paper published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_5433459415119130374&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06957-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fpeoples-racial-and-ethnic-identities-dont-reflect-their-genetic-ancestry" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06957-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-023-06957-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fgenetics%2Fpeoples-racial-and-ethnic-identities-dont-reflect-their-genetic-ancestry" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 that had also analyzed genomic data provided by All of Us participants. At the time, the paper was criticized &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/huge-genome-study-confronted-concerns-over-race-analysis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/content/article/huge-genome-study-confronted-concerns-over-race-analysis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;by some experts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who argued that the technique used to analyze the race and ethnicity data could be misconstrued to support the incorrect idea that humans can be neatly categorized into distinct races. The new study, which used a different data-crunching technique, found the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="variation-among-u-s-states-3"&gt;Variation among U.S. states&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found that, even within the same ethnic and racial group, people show genetic variation across different U.S. states. This could reflect the "historical impacts of U.S. colonization, the transatlantic slave trade, and recent migrations," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key example of this was seen in participants who identified as Hispanic or Latino and lived in states like California, Texas and Arizona, who were found to have a high proportion of Native American ancestry compared with Hispanic and Latino people in other parts of the U.S. This makes sense considering many of these states were historically part of Mexico, which has a large population of people with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/Ethnic-groups" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico/Ethnic-groups" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;mixed Indigenous and European ancestries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, of people who identified as Hispanic or Latino, those in New York were found to have the highest proportion of African ancestry, which is "consistent with recent migration from the Caribbean to New York."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors said their findings show that the genetic backgrounds of people in the U.S. are highly complex and that "social constructs of race and ethnicity do not accurately reflect underlying genetic ancestry." In light of this, the researchers have said they "do not recommend using race and ethnicity as proxies for ancestry in genetic studies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/m/tesfaye-mersha" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/bio/m/tesfaye-mersha" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tesfaye Mersha&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of pediatrics and a human genetics researcher at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and the University of Cincinnati, said that he agrees that these self-reported categories should not be used in genetic studies. Instead, the categories should be confined to social studies "where we know they will have a big impact," he told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, Mersha also warned against overinterpreting the study's takeaways about regional and state-level genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some states had very low participant numbers, which may skew regional estimates and limit generalizability," he noted. "Moreover, high population mobility across states blurs geographic boundaries, especially in the absence of multigenerational ancestry data," he said. In short, because people move around a lot, it's difficult to draw conclusions without having a clear sense of how long their families have been based in a given state.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;io9 is proud to present fiction from Lightspeed Magazine. Once a month, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-movie-star-endures-hollywoods-dystopian-embrace-of-ai-in-this-near-future-short-story-2000602519"&gt;we feature a story&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-months-epic-lightspeed-story-is-one-of-the-best-weve-read-in-years-2000584780"&gt;from Lightspeed’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/read-the-conclusion-of-this-months-epic-and-excellent-lightspeed-short-story-2000584809"&gt;current issue&lt;/a&gt;. This month’s selection is “The Twenty-One Second God” by Peter Watts. Enjoy!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The Twenty-One Second God&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;by Peter Watts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Individual:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span&gt; a living system maintaining both a higher level of internal cooperation and a lower level of internal conflict than either its components or any larger systems of which it is a component.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;—Fields and Levin, 2018&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We lost so many souls today. Reports stream in across five continents; icons bloom on the map like blood spatters. Broken filters, zero latency, bandwidth that somehow blew through the roof when no one was looking. The hardware plays catch-up as best it can: this number of petaflops, that many milliseconds, ten thousand network nodes stuttering under the weight of increased traffic. Chemicals spiking and crashing in brains the world over: GABA and serotonin and a dozen others that would make perfect sense to you, if you were still here. Muscles locked in sudden tetanus. Adrenaline cascades shocking hearts into spastic fibrillation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It happened so much faster than meat could react. A million emergency subroutines struggled to wrest back some measure of control. They seem to have prevailed, for now. The fences are back up at least, the throttles re-engaged. The network was staggering back to some kind of Normal before Meta’s human overseers had time to do much more than blanch and panic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nobody can say what just happened, except that it lasted twenty-one seconds and it spanned the world. For twenty-one seconds, countless human souls just &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;disappeared&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apparently I’m one of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know whether to call it memory or hallucination: a flash that might be called a sort of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;revelation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, in the same way you could describe the sun as a sort of bright candle. Everything made sense in a way that nothing ever has. I could see reality right down to the electrons—and now that I’m back, it’s all gone. As though I dreamed the solution to Unified Field Theory and lost every last detail upon waking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s strange watching a world flattened to two dimensions but the metaverse is down until they can figure out what happened. The numbers keep climbing. Frantic hordes jamming the lines to Telehealth. People picking themselves up off the streets, frightened, confused, marionettes whose strings were cut without warning and reconnected without explanation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others have to be—found. They’re finding us in our living rooms and beds. Finding us on the toilet. They’re finding us in cars, slack-jawed and drooling, locked in autopilot orbits with no destinations. Some are pretty much okay. Some are psychotic, traumatized; they stare into infinity and scream at the slightest touch. Some are vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They keep &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;finding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; us. The curve bends into the exponential, thousands to tens of thousands to millions, no inflection point in sight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They haven’t found me yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Downstream effects, now. Businesses instantly bankrupt, search-and-rescue operations on indefinite hold, surgeries aborted midstream. The sort of disruptions you’d expect. But there are other things, too. Rumors and reports that can’t be so easily chalked up to over-reliance on a technological monoculture. A research program at MIT just had its funding increased by two orders of magnitude. A half-dozen Peruvian SSI plants are mysteriously offline, although they were isolated on their own network. And—legal actions, of all things: thousands of them, launched from the ether during the blackout, drafted by rafts of automatic corporations that sprang miraculously into existence across a hundred jurisdictions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Rumors split and speciate like cracks across a frozen lake: stories of something that woke up and moved across the face of the waters and went away again. They graduate from conspiracy theory to working hypothesis in the space of an hour. Reputable sources neither confirm nor deny, but admit the possibility that something &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;coalesced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; in those moments. They aren’t entirely sure what it was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Somebody calls it the Twenty-One Second God. From that point on, no one calls it anything else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The knock on the door barely registers. I don’t know anyone else in this building. I didn’t buzz anyone in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But there they are, two of them, standing in the hall. “Corwin Sukarto? We understand you’ve experienced a problem with your Hogan bridge.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’ve found me. The curve bends a little more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But they’re not with Meta. They’re wearing uniforms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sir, we need you to come with us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m in a private downtown hospital with anonymous facades. I’m in a bright cylindrical coffin full of chittering magnets. I’m on a diagnostic table that projects my flayed body onto the wall and labels my insides with floating annotations I don’t understand. The techs cowled in their headsets are Nella and Travis; they don’t offer their last names and I don’t ask. I don’t ask them anything, really, although I suppose I should. I should be curious, at least, about what’s happening to me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I haven’t been curious about much of anything since you went away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They pull off their headsets while I put my clothes back on (Nella reminds me a little of your sister). An elevator lifts us a dozen floors; we emerge into a windowless, oak-paneled room where soft light seeps from the baseboards and overstuffed chairs squat around a glass coffee table. I remember a very old movie: an astronaut in a terrarium, surrounded by sterile props his alien captors think will make him feel at home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here, at last, are the suits. They also travel in pairs. “I’m Karina,” one says. She wears an antique briefcase slung over her shoulder. “This is Darcelle. We’re with Metaverse. First of all, we’d like to say how sorry we are about what happened to you . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;About&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t understand,” I say. “They said there were millions of us . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fifteen million, give or take.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I turn to see a middle-aged man in uniform, closing the door behind him. “Colonel Jim Moore,” Karina tells me. “WestHem Alliance.” She doesn’t look especially pleased that the Colonel has served up such a definitive body count.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A military escort. A medical workup that would strain the limits of a Platinum policy. Two-and-a-half hours so far, and they seem to be just getting started.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You can’t be devoting this much personal attention to fifteen million people,” I say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Not just yet,” Darcelle admits. “You’re special.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Colonel clears his throat. “What Ms. Burrowes means is that you were assimilated during a window of high analytical interest.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Assimilated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;More than hypothesis, then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darcelle shoots a sidelong glance at Moore and recovers the ball. “We’d like to retain you for further studies. You could be extremely valuable in helping us figure out what happened, helping us ensure it doesn’t happen again. You’d be well-compensated, of course. We’ve already recruited someone to fill in for you at Grassy Narrows, so that’s not a problem. You’re a, a soil scientist, right?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Close enough.” I don’t feel like arguing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Karina again: “Before we go any further, I’d just like to say again that we sincerely regret any discomfort or inconvenience or, or pain that this incident may have caused.” She fumbles with her briefcase and extracts a sheaf of paper half a centimeter thick. “We’d like to compensate you for that too, up front. No questions asked.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She holds it out to me. I look but don’t touch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sorry about the format.” Karina affects a rueful smile. “Normally of course we’d just squirt it to your bridge, but, well . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Send it to my watch,” I tell her.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We usually do everything in the metaverse.” Her smile frays a little. “We’re not really set up for niche media.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s a difficult time for all of us,” Darcelle adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I take it. It’s forty-three single-spaced pages, but the amount they’re offering is on the first. I have no idea whether it’s generous or not. I flip to the end. “No signature line.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Oh, everything’s on the record here. Once you’ve received the document, verbal confirmation is all we need.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I rifle through the pages; the font seems deliberately designed to make my eyes glaze, but something twitches in my brain around page ten. I try to focus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Waive the right to pursue any personal or class action . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darcelle nods. “We think it’s better to get the money to those who need it as quickly as possible, without any lengthy and expensive court proceedings.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These legal things can go on for years,” Karina adds. “And the outcome is never guaranteed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I glance around the terrarium. Karina and Darcelle beam hundred-watt smiles. Nella and Travis seem strangely attentive to the decor. Colonel Moore stands ramrod straight and somehow manages to look very tired at the same time. He meets my eyes; after a moment he offers a tiny, almost indiscernible shake of the head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fine,” I say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moore escorts me to ground level. “We’d like you to remain here for a few days,” he says as the elevator seals us in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Uh huh.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; special, as Ms. Burrowes put it.” There’s an aftertaste in the wake of her name, although his voice is unimpeachably neutral. “We think we could learn a lot from you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Anything you couldn’t learn if I slept in my own bed?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This would be more efficient.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I wonder if I’m allowed to refuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You are of course free to leave any time you like.” Evidently the Colonel has been here before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Permission to speak freely.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He raises an amused eyebrow, plays along. “Granted.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think I’m free because you don’t have a cage big enough to hold fifteen million of us. Not to mention the millions more who saw us disappear.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You think we’d incarcerate fifteen million innocent people.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Isn’t that the traditional approach? Circle the wagons, invoke national security? Control the narrative?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’d like to think &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;fixing the problem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; might be in there somewhere.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The doors part onto a pristine lobby where no one sits at Reception. Night has fallen; the glass facade separating us from the street is a dark mirror.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re not wrong,” the Colonel admits. “Although we certainly have the resources to incarcerate a limited number of high-value assets. For their own protection, of course. I doubt anyone would complain, given what’s at stake. And yet . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He gestures at the glass. Through the half-reflections I see a vehicle idling at the curb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’ll take you home,” Moore says. “Pick you up at 0830 tomorrow, assuming you choose to participate.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The building lets us out. I climb into the car, hesitate. Stick my foot back onto the curb to keep the door from closing. “I’m—sorry if I was a dick back there. I know you’re just doing your job.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That’s me all right.” Something tugs at the corner of his mouth. “Just following orders.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I answer their questions. I submit to their tests. I come in in the morning and go home at night in the backs of company cars that know where I live and refuse to take me anywhere else. The people who experiment on me are friendly enough. Nella and Travis treat their lab rats well and they don’t talk down to me. The suits with their fastened smiles drop by now and then to impart encouraging platitudes. Colonel Moore visits the facility every few days, ever civil, ever distant. Other faces come and go, curious but not hostile.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They say I’m an optimum. Those who were swallowed before me earlier entered as loud voices in a small room: parts of some newborn not yet big enough to overwhelm, not yet old enough to have an agenda. I’m told they remember infancy but no intent. Those assimilated later were never more than whispers in a hurricane: they remember as much as a single neuron might, if you ripped it from someone’s head and demanded to know what the brain was thinking.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was raptured at some sweet spot between ignorance and unconsciousness. I at least remember a flash of focused insight, which the machines might be able to tag and track to something deeper. I’m not catatonic. I’m still sane.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I may have you to thank for that. Travis tells me, with all the insight of someone who has never grieved, that grief rewires the brain. Cortisol and cytokines out of whack, hyperactivity in the amygdala and the anterior cingulate gyrus. They think it may have buffered me during the transition. It’s one of their hypotheses. They have a lot of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The details don’t interest me. Some of us came back. Some of us didn’t.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They pull me from the scanner again. “How much longer are we doing this?” It’s been over a week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Don’t underestimate the value of time-series.” Nella shines a light in my eye, measures some response that a few million dollars’ worth of medical equipment apparently hasn’t recorded already. “Your brain underwent a huge shock. Some neurons got superstimulated, some got stuck. Functional clusters wiped out in an instant. Others crosswired. Parts of your brain that were never supposed to talk to each other started shooting the shit like old friends. It’s a real mess in there.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Think a massive overdose of psychoactives with a PTSD chaser,” Travis chimes in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nella nods. “We weren’t around for the main event, so we gotta settle for recording the aftermath. Plot the recovery curve, backcast to t=0. The longer the time-series, the better the backcast.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m not back to baseline yet?” It’s been days. I remember you telling me once that even sticky neurons rebound after a few hours.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We don’t know,” she says. “It’s double-blind, so we don’t get to see the actual analysis. But some node must still be doing something interesting, because nobody’s called us off yet. Gotta keep the sample size consistent.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s what they call us. Not victims: too disempowering. Not complainants: we signed the waivers. Not survivors, because too many of us didn’t. Not even people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nodes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I can’t deny it. I was not a person during the period under investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Oh, the body persisted; the flesh stayed warm, the organs kept functioning, the heart never missed a beat. Even the brain continued to spike and spark and even think, they say, although it was completely unaware of doing that. Of course, that’s hardly unusual; you always delighted in pointing out that most of our thoughts are unconscious even at the best of times. You’d talk about our autonomic modes, the way we iterate through complex daily routines on autopilot. Regale me with tales of sleepwalking artists and sex workers and even murderers, committing their acts of creation and commerce and destruction, unconscious the whole time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But even those zombies knew enough to answer to their own names. For twenty-one seconds, there was nothing in the world that could say &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am Corwin Sukarto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. For twenty-one seconds I did not exist. No needs, no desires, no consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;No pain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So many people seem terrified by the prospect. Not everyone, though. As I understand it, half a billion people around the world actually aspire to that state. They call it Nirvana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I admit I never really saw the appeal, before now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They don’t even know what it wants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s the wrong tense, of course. The Twenty-One Second God has been dead for two weeks now; even the hardware it inhabited has been throttled, time-lagged, crippled to the point it barely delivers VR anymore. Everything it was, everything it wanted: all in the past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And yet it continues to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;: all those legal actions winding through the courts, the AIgents retained, the lobby groups that coalesced seemingly out of nowhere on its behalf. The rights of mayfly deities. The creation and the murder of a hive mind. Restitution strategies that would compel some random assortment of people to plug their brains into a resurrected Whole for an hour a week, so 21 might be born again. All planned out and launched in those fleeting moments between emergence and annihilation. All running, now, on autopilot. These motions and countermotions, this network of activity crisscrossing the globe at lightspeed: almost a mind in its own right, some say. The campaign itself might be sapient.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But nobody’s certain what it’s campaigning for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legal claims are straightforward: 21 wants its life back. Apparently it has a survival instinct. That shouldn’t be surprising for an entity with fifteen million brain stems, but those in the know assure me that things aren’t quite that simple. Some say it was barely conscious even when it was alive, that consciousness itself is just ignorance in action. It only boots up when the universe hands us something unexpected: when the brain has to learn new tricks or decide between competing imperatives. Ask the pianist, mid-concerto, to think about what their fingers are doing. Ask the martial artist which muscles are moving in which order, why they feinted left instead of right. Once the knowledge has been assimilated, being aware of it only destroys the performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brain aspires to error reduction, the self to annihilation. Phi isn’t a line but a curve, rising and peaking and arcing back to zero as the system approaches perfect knowledge. We baseline humans never even glimpse the summit; our thoughts are simple and our models are childish stick-figures, the world is always taking us by surprise. But what’s unexpected to a being with fifteen million times the computational mass of a human mind? All gods are omniscient. All gods are zombies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They say 21 may have been awake during those first few instants when it had swallowed only a few hundred souls. When it swallowed me. But thousands? Millions? The more it knew, the less it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;knew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It became a concert pianist in complete control of every keyboard. It grew too smart to be awake: as brilliant as any deity, as conscious as any stone.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They say it wants its life back. But how can a stone want anything?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All the nodes get cafeteria passes. Maybe the free food is supposed to make it easier for us to socialise. Maybe the place is infested with pickups to feed our chatter into some deep-learning algo panning for insight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe they just don’t want us heading off-site for lunch if they think of another test.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We never really talk much, though. Even when the other nodes do sit together, I’ve never heard the conversation stray beyond a murmured &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;pass the salt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Whatever comfort we take from each other, we take it in silence. I don’t even know any of their names.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d rather just talk to you anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“May I join you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Colonel Moore, a mug of coffee in his hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I gesture to the seat across from me. He sits, sets his coffee on the table between us. “Any new results?” I ask, before he can speak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He hesitates. “Seems to be a bandwidth correlation, not that that’s any great surprise. Most of the nodes were wired into fantasy scenarios. Games, worldsims, personal fantasies. Fat-pipe stuff.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wasn’t.” I was logged in to an online support group, sick with the loss of you, able only to mourn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So I understand.” He sips his coffee. “I’ve been told that therapeutic tulpas can be helpful.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So have I.” But that’s one of the marvelous hazards of marriage to a neuroscientist: you learn to wonder about implications. Thanks to you I know that when you anesthetize half a brain, the other half might manifest a whole new personality. I know that when the drugs wear off, that short-lived persona—that standalone, autonomous &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;being—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;gets swallowed back into the greater whole. Tulpas don’t take up much real estate—a few functional clusters here and there—but they’d still pass any Turing test you could throw at them. Who’s to say we’re not waking something up every time we activate the partition? Who’s to say we don’t commit murder every time we shut it down?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“TMS is also very effective,” the Colonel continues. “Doesn’t stick, though. Propanolol, if you prefer old-school pharma.” Because of course no one should ever be crippled by grief. No one should be compromised by anything so vulgar. Ugly things, Pleistocene things, these feelings. Edit them out. Let the past lie. Get on with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Odd that he’s so conversant with the subject, though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Are you married, Colonel?” He’s at least as old as I am, old enough for bygone ways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I am.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Still together?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We see each other regularly.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn’t want to talk about it; whatever I sense in him now goes deeper than an unhappy marriage. But I do sense something. Loss. His own kind of grief. I’ve been in this place long enough to know what it looks like from the outside.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Figures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over four hundred people in this mad-scientist lab, and the closest thing I can find to a kindred spirit is the professional killer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Someone’s waiting for me outside my building. He calls me by name; I’ve never seen him before. He begs me to share my wisdom, and does not believe me when I say I have none to offer. I am part of the overmind, he insists. I am connected to the Divine; I have seen things denied mortal men. I am the voice of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remind him that God has fifteen million voices. I wish him luck finding one of the others. I warn him that God has turned many of us into rutabagas. He grows agitated; I have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;duty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, he growls. God did not bless me so that I could keep His Truth to myself. It is not mine to keep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m afraid he might turn violent, but I’m inside before he can do more than rant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s happening everywhere. There are lists in circulation: guerilla footage of survivors stumbling through the aftermath, squeezed through facial recognition and matched against public records. Confidential databases inexplicably set free. We’re public domain now, some of us anyway. People seek us out. Some are content to touch the hems of our garments; others want more, a taste of whatever cosmic insights we forged when part of something greater. Should they risk that operation. Should they go to Heaven. Should they bet it all on #3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We weren’t just the voice of God: we were the guts as well. The arms and legs. The synapses. God literally stitched Itself together out of our bodies, an inconceivably complex jigsaw assembled from any meat that happened to be wired into the right servers. Surely such an intellect learned everything, while it was alive. Surely its pieces still remember what it learned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I tell the Colonel about the encounter. He reminds me that I can stay at the facility. I admit I’m tempted. It would be more convenient. It would be safer, now that the AIrheads have found me. But I can only talk to you here, Ada. I can’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; you the way I do at home. And I’ve never fully shaken the belief that they’d keep me here by force, if the optics permitted and the damage hadn’t already been done. They’d probably like nothing better than to see me cage myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Darcelle’s smile tightens like shrink-wrap when I decline. The Colonel shrugs and offers to post a microdrone outside my building. Nothing flashy or intimidating or even noticeable to the casual observer. An invisible eye in the sky, smart enough to tell refugees from religious nuts—different mindsets have different tells, to eyes that can read saccades and muscle twitches from fifty meters—so I won’t have to worry about embarrassing false positives. The homeless and the destitute will be able to approach me as they always have; only those of ill intent will even know it’s there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I thank him, and accept his kind offer, and we both pretend his machines haven’t been staking out my every move from the start.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Something about my ventromedial prefrontal cortex has them scratching their heads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That can’t be right,” Travis says. “It’s supposed to be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;sending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to the hipp.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nella furrows her brow. “Could the Hogan bridge have done that?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe third-order downstream effect or something. But we checked it last week.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe we can book some time on Monet. Bet it would chew through this no problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Monet?” I ask.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They’re booked solid for a year.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We’re the 21 club, Trav. We’ve got a VIP pass. I say we use it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Could just be an artifact. Maybe we should run him through again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I add a decibel or two: “What’s Monet?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They snap back into a reality that includes me. “MOANAI,” Nella says. “AI up in Waterloo, maybe six times human synapse count. Perimeter uses it for theoretical cosmology, but it can do other stuff as well.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Sometimes it dreams,” Travis adds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Is it awake?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Christ no. Why would you say that?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I shrug. “Synapse count. Dreams.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He smiles, shakes his head. “Nah. Dreams are just injections of noise to prevent overfitting. But when you loosen the parameters like that you can open up whole new ways to interpret a data set.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Besides,” Nella says, “consciousness always wrecks the analysis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not the only thing. A voltage spike fries MOANAI’s servers while they’re still booking the appointment; a substation blows out three hundred kilometers away and the whole campus goes dark.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not that brownouts and violent weather are anything unusual. Our infrastructure grows so fragile; the resources to maintain it stretch thinner by the day. Even without the heat waves and the superstorms, it’s a lucky week that passes without the lights going out at least once. But that’s why there are safeguards. Breakers behind breakers. Stacks of coffin-sized batteries gorging on sunlight, primed to ration it back the moment anything drops off-grid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;None of it’s foolproof, of course. What is, these days? But the odds. The coincidence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I find out later that MOANAI’s not the only player to drop off the board under suspicious circumstances. DARPA had a small hive running down in Lawrence Livermore until last week: a dozen souls seasoned with neural dust and connected through a central hub. Something went wrong. The ultrasonic pulses the dust motes used to talk to each other started inducing spike trains in the somatosensory cortex. One person screamed that her arm was monstrous, alien, sawed it half off before anyone could stop her. Two others gouged their own eyes out. I can’t imagine what they must have been seeing, and they’ll never be able to tell us. Every node in that hive is either dead or vegetative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone’s still very nice to me. Nobody tells me anything that might get me upset. They don’t realize how much they say to each other when I’m just around the corner; I guess when you’re fighting rearguard against a dead god it’s easy to forget the lab rats underfoot. But I see past the facade. Their tests grow more frequent, more intrusive. I show up earlier and they keep me later. They’re running scared, and they’ve got nothing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s been a month and Twenty-One still reaches out from the grave, casually swatting their best countermeasures as if they were flies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You would have liked Nella. She even talks like you. You would’ve pricked up your ears at that offhand comment—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;—consciousness always wrecks the analysis—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;—and instantly recognized a kindred spirit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sometimes I close my eyes and hear you in her: vision’s a lie, reality’s an abstraction, consciousness itself is a contaminant. The details are pure alchemy to me—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;free-energy-minimization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Markov blankets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;periaqueductal gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;—but she spells out the broad strokes like she’s telling a ghost story around a campfire. Consciousness is a delivery platform for feelings; feelings are a manifestation of need; need exists to promote survival; and survival fucks up your whole worldview. Predator-detection algorithms that metastasize into religion. Hyperbolic discounts, selling out the future for short-term payoffs. Pareidolia and availability cascades and all those other myriad biases that helped us survive by lying about reality: we wouldn’t be conscious in the first place if they weren’t built in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, Nella’s just a kid. Words tumble out of her like puppies. You were more eloquent, more concise. You nailed it with two sentences and a wicked smile: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can see the world as it is, or you can care whether you live or die. You can’t optimize along both axes simultaneously&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These days, I can’t seem to do either.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They still don’t know who, but they just found out how:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meta lied about the tech.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was the fundamental safeguard, baked into every Hogan bridge ever made: limit the bandwidth. Connect minds to machines, if you must. Connect brains to each other—but use a straw, not a firehose. Share sensations but not selves; keep latency far away from that three-hundred-millisecond threshold where parts begin cohering into wholes. Never forget the terrifying existential truth behind every ghost in every machine:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Consciousness does not multiply; it expands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it turns out those fuckers used a firehose after all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nobody knew because patents describe concepts, not implementation. Nobody knew because the tech based on those concepts was proprietary. Nobody knew because it worked, and it worked because Metaverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;TM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; made the firehose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;act&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; like a straw; they introduced a time lag into every signal so that nothing moved fast enough to sync up.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s still not clear what they were planning to do with all that extra capacity. Caught in the headlights, pants around their ankles, they can’t get their stories straight. They were leaving room for sensory upgrades still in the works. They were developing remote, inorganic teletulpas to improve mental health for all. They were leaving space to hold a whole new Internet, against that inevitable day when failing infrastructure or terrorist activity takes the old one down. Maybe they were even going for a hive mind of their own, although their denials on that front were strenuous and immediate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the meantime, someone snuck in through the back door. Someone disabled the lag and unleashed a globe-spanning corpus callosum that connected fifteen million brains as intimately as the hemispheres in one connect to each other. There was no &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; in those moments, any more than there are two people in my head right now. There was only the Twenty-One Second God. The rest is history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For those of us caught up by that history, nothing much has changed. If anything, things for me have improved a little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least I don’t have to deal with Karina and Darcelle anymore.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He finds me in the cafeteria again and asks—politely, as always—for the pleasure of my company. He sits, relocates a coffee and a plate of kruggets to the table, slides his tray to one side. He focuses on these precise, robotic movements, eyes on the table, on his lunch. He sits quietly, collecting his thoughts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve been going over our findings. Trying to make some kind of sense of them.” He grunts a soft laugh. “Not that there’s much hope of that, of course. I don’t have nearly the expertise the staff here does, and between you and me I don’t think they have a clue either.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not like this man to waste words on preamble. “What can I do for you, Colonel?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was just wondering what it was like,” he says softly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know what to tell him. I don’t know what to tell any of them. I’ve tried often enough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I try again. “You know how, when you close your eyes, you still know where all your parts are? You just know, without looking, where you end and everything else begins?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He nods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Imagine that you knew, in the exact same way, that you went on forever. That everything else was as much a part of you as your arms and legs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I get the faintest sense of impatience behind that disciplined facade. Not that I blame him: I’m not saying anything I haven’t already spoken into the record a dozen times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I try to give him a little more. “There were—insights, I suppose you could call them. Profound insights, even, but”—I tapped the side of my head—“they don’t fit in here. I remember knowing such amazing things. I just can’t remember what any of them were.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And then, of course, I knew nothing at all. This dazzling burst of enlightenment everyone’s so interested in—it only lasted a moment before I drowned in an ocean of souls.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I’ve said all that before, too. It still isn’t what he’s looking for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve seen the interviews,” he says at last. “I’m familiar with religious rapture and proprioception failure. And I don’t mean to intrude, but—but maybe I’m not asking what it was like so much as how it made you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;feel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not a huge difference, but no one has asked me in quite that way before. And I realize something else: this man is desperate. He’s so desperate he’ll come here and interrogate a specimen who’s already been interviewed and sampled and scanned down the molecules, in the faint, fading hope that some useful insight might have slipped past the machinery.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He’s desperate because they’re losing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I look at my half-eaten lunch, at his untouched one. “I was married a long time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Twenty-one years. Something of a record, these days.” And then, because you’re supposed to say it and he hasn’t yet: “I’m sorry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“People don’t get that,” I tell him. “It was the whole deal: traditional; antique, even. Monogamous. First-person sex, we used ‘skins maybe a dozen times in two decades.” The ever-present weight on my diaphragm stirs, begins to rise. “Ada told me on some level the brain can’t really tell the difference between losing an arm and losing a loved one. The same circuits light up whether the pain’s physical or emotional. I always thought that was almost—romantic.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He opens his mouth. “I’m—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So imagine your arm doesn’t just get torn off. Imagine it withers and rots on your shoulder, imagine it takes months to die. And at some point, way later than you should have, you finally stop being a selfish asshole and—and tell her it’s okay. She can stop fighting. She can let go.” The weight is lodged in my throat now, but I keep going. “I wonder what part of the brain parses &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; kind of injury.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You wanted to know how it made me feel. You have to know this before you can know that. Because once the arm is gone, everything just goes gray. You’re not connected to the universe; you’re not even really connected to your own body. You just—exist.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And then this happens.” I take a breath, let it out, feel a twinge of grim satisfaction that it’s almost steady. “You get swept up in a moment of blinding, divine revelation, and you’re connected to all of creation and you realize, right down in your bones, that we insignificant specks of meat and bone—we just don’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;matter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. And then the Twenty-One Second God swallows you whole and snuffs you out and again—nothing matters, nothing &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; matter because you don’t exist. But then you come back, and the sirens are blaring and the world is on its side but she’s still gone, and so . . . once again . . .”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I breathe. The weight sinks grudgingly into my chest and goes back to sleep, leaden, comfortable. Everything is back to normal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe that’s why I’m your optimum data point. Maybe that’s why I’m not a vegetable now. Revelation wasn’t such a shock to me because I was already—inoculated. Nothing really changed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I look at the Colonel. I don’t know whether I’ve given him new data or merely corroborated the old. I don’t know if I’m reporting to a superior or commiserating with a comrade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know anything about this man.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I envy you,” he says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t have to go in tomorrow. None of us do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nella and Travis are relocating. They’ve got the data they need, there’s no point in staying shackled to these virtual-vivisection machines any longer. It’s just numbers from here on in, the program—this part of it, anyway—is going full-on analytical. At long last, they say, they’re making progress.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t think I believe them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I remember the light in your eyes when you were closing on a solution. Your excitement was almost predatory, you didn’t stop moving. Whenever something called you away—whenever &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; did—you couldn’t wait to get back to it. You glowed. You &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;vibrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s none of that in these people. There’s something in their eyes, but it’s not that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Haunted. Maybe that’s the word.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe they’ll conduct their analysis in some secret bunker. Maybe there is no analysis. It isn’t lost on them—the freak accidents, the tragic BCI malfunctions, the misfortune befalling those pursuing certain avenues of research. Maybe they’re right, maybe there’s simply no more they can accomplish here. Or maybe they’ve decided to leave the game before the targets on their chests get any bigger.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not my problem. The money’s in my account. Grassy Narrows waits at the end of the month. Your dimming echo still lingers throughout this two-bedroom still-life I call home. I’ve wiped my biometrics, said my goodbyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Except to the Colonel, who didn’t come in today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new hive woke up today in Indore. The video’s on every feed: two hundred souls wired together, stacked in hexagonal pods like honeycomb, tended by machines that look like chrome grasshoppers. Pallets writhe in slow peristalsis, rocking their occupants around an eccentric orbit optimized to prevent bedsores. Tubes carry waste and nutrients; limbs twitch to milliamp currents that keep the muscles from atrophy. Fiberop sprouts from the base of each skull and disappears out-of-frame en route to some central server. The mouths are all smiling, but I think that might have been added in post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not an accident, this time. Not a malfunction or a hijacking. These people volunteered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s been in the works for years now; it wasn’t supposed to go up for years yet. But 21—accelerated things. Wars always push technology into fast-forward, even the quiet ones. They say we’re ten years ahead of where we were a year ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Indian Institute of Technology speaks of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the Great Coalescence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, paints pictures of Nature’s secrets laid bare by a mind combining the cognitive power of a supercomputer with the imaginations of a million dreamers. They haven’t reported any actual breakthroughs yet, but it’s only been a day. Even Yahweh took six to find his feet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There’s a waiting list. A second installation is set to go online in Kolkata the day after tomorrow, a third in Colombo. Negotiations are underway with Japan and Thailand and Malaysia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They’re calling it the Moksha Mind.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A growing chorus of voices say we should just throw in the towel. No army of lawyers, no swarm of AIgents could possibly win a war against a coherent self with fifteen million times the synapse count of a human mind, no matter how long it’s been dead. Oh, we win the occasional battle—but some suggest that even 21’s rare legal defeats are deliberate, part of some farsighted strategy to delay ultimate victory until vital technological milestones have been reached. The Twenty-One Second God is beyond mortal ken, they say. Even our victories promote Its Holy Agenda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I don’t know if I’d go that far. Then again, maybe I’d go farther.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bacteria would still be the pinnacle of life if chloroplasts and mitochondria had retained their autonomy. Multicellular life wouldn’t exist if eukaryotic cells had never graduated from competition to cooperation. Every major evolutionary transition began with individuals trading in their individuality. Every leap forward was an act of assimilation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We’re already colonies of colonies. Maybe this is just another step in a journey that’s already lasted four billion years, maybe—without these periodic episodes of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;coalescence—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;life on Earth would be nothing but a seething mass of cells, trying ceaselessly to outbreed each other.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not that going down the Metazoan road hasn’t also turned the planet into a shithole. Still.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better than Cancer World.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;• • •&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There was a time when this place thrummed: rivers of people lined up to depart for far-flung destinations; others, rumpled and red-eyed, spilling into the concourse like blood from a torn capillary. Clots of humanity clustered around overhead displays, checking departures and arrivals. Dogs and drones and thugs with badges, pushing their way through the crowd, seizing random dark-skinned strangers and disappearing them into Secondary. I remember it so clearly, though I was only eight or nine at the time: cavernous halls, jam-packed and cacophonous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now there are so few here that I can see him halfway down the concourse. His footsteps click and echo in the empty spaces.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I think about what to say as he approaches. Not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;are you following me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;how did you know I’d be here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Nothing so obvious. Everyone knows everything, these days. Moore knows more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Come to say goodbye?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He shakes his head. “To ask you to reconsider.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’ve considered a thousand times, Colonel. You don’t spend three years’ carbon allowance on a whim.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“That doesn’t mean you’re doing it for the right reasons.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I just want to go home.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You were born in Cincinnati.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I have family in Sumatra.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Which is how you got the visa, yes. And how do you think your family will react when they learn that the only reunion they can look forward to is visiting some robot that rolls you over like a corpse every half hour to keep the sores from festering?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I watch him watching me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m sorry,” he says after a moment. “I don’t mean to presume.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I wait for him to continue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You can’t just give up,” he says at last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Is that what I’m doing?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s suicide, Corwin. You of all people must know that. Plug into that thing and you deprecate from soul down to subroutine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Maybe a subroutine doing something useful. Maybe a subroutine figuring out how to undo all the damage we’ve done.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’ll never know, though, will you? You’ll just be another neuron firing blindly away, never knowing if the brain you’re part of is solving the secrets of the universe or if you’re just—firing, with no purpose at all. You could be giving up your life for random static.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I feel the corner of my lip tug into a smile. “Do you really think they’d spend all that money, invest in all that hardware, recruit all those people—for static?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think experiments fail sometimes. I think the grander the experiment, the greater the risk. That hive hasn’t done a damn thing since it went online, as far as anyone can tell. It just swallows souls and lets them rot.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I don’t think even you believe that,” I say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;hope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; that. It’s my best-case scenario. Because otherwise it’s biding its time and gathering its strength, and at this rate it’ll be bigger than 21 by the end of the year. When it does act, we’ll have no idea what hit us.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Why would it be hostile?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It wouldn’t have to be. It could roll over in its sleep and crush us like an insect.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hives are no longer legal here. I wonder in passing if WestHem is planning to preempt, but I suspect that ship has sailed; to take out Moksha now they’d have to bomb a string of cities from India to Japan, declare war on a dozen countries. Not easy to justify when your enemy hasn’t actually done anything.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I appreciate your efforts, Colonel. Honestly. But—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You know, you’re a very interesting person.” Suddenly his expression is unreadable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I shake my head. “I’m a glorified gardener.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Yet consider your circumstance. Ringside for everything. Buffered by your own grief against the worst effects of the rapture. Dead center of our high-value demographic, but somehow we’ve learned very little from you we can use. Thanks to your marriage you have just enough familiarity to understand the jargon, but not enough for anyone to worry about what a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;glorified gardener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; might overhear. And here you are, reporting back to the Hive. Somehow you even managed to jump the queue.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A completely different Hive,” I remind him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Perhaps. But maybe we have it all wrong. We assume 21’s trying to resurrect itself, but it was hardly the first hive on the planet. It was just the first—unconstrained one. That we know of. And &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;something&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; had to break those filters. Something brought it to life. Now Moksha’s online, years ahead of schedule. Another hive started up right under our noses over in Oregon, some new organic technology we never heard of before. We can’t even legally shut it down because meat doesn’t qualify as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;hardware&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; under the Interface Act. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg. We think there are others, more—clandestine.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“So you think it was, what? Some kind of reproductive strategy?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Spawning cycle. Field test. How can we know? We’re earthworms, trying to divine the thoughts of astronauts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A gift for metaphor. This man is never what I expect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Or maybe it’s not that,” he continues. “Maybe all hives are connected in ways we don’t understand. Maybe 21 and Moksha and the Bicams are one and the same.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You think it reprogrammed me. Turned me into some kind of sleeper agent.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I doubt there would’ve been much programming involved. It had fifteen million souls to choose from. At least a few of them must have met the specs right off the shelf. Followed their own agenda for their own reasons, never even suspecting that they were doing exactly—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You could stop me,” I point out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What makes you think we haven’t tried?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Huh. Of course they would.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Then again,” he adds, “if we could stop you, we wouldn’t have to.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Then why are you here?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m hoping maybe you can stop yourself.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I shake my head. “I’m just—I’m tired of being a prokaryote, Colonel. I’m tired of being alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You’re tired of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;being&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Jim—”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If there are hostilities,” he says. “If you’re on the other side.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Then there won’t be a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; to worry about. Isn’t that the whole point?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;His face doesn’t change. “Don’t do this.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“My flight’s boarding.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;He lets me go. Maybe I’m a friend. Maybe I’m only an asset he’s failed to keep out of enemy hands. Maybe the ghost of the Twenty-One Second God is invisibly at work all around us, iterating through the walls and the wires: running interference so the shutdown signal never reaches my ride, so the executive order to cancel the flight never makes it through, so any attempt to use force would attract the attention of security drones ever watchful for signs of violence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I feel eyes on me as I walk into the boarding tunnel. I imagine them watching as the airplane, only half-full, taxis away from the dock.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe he’s right. Maybe you are, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Maybe, if you want to see the world through clear eyes, you can’t care whether you live or die.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the Author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Peter Watts is a former marine biologist, flesh-eating-disease survivor, and convicted felon (long story) whose novels—despite an unhealthy focus on space vampires—have become required texts for university courses ranging from Philosophy to Neuropsychology. His work is available in 24 languages, has appeared in 36 best-of-year anthologies, and been nominated for 61 awards. His (somewhat shorter) list of 23 actual wins includes the Hugo, the Shirley Jackson, and the Seiun. He seems to be especially popular in countries with a history of Soviet occupation, and he hated the U.S. before it was cool. He lives in Toronto with fantasy author Caitlin Sweet, four cats, two rabbits, whatever injured/convalescing rodents they’ve been able to rescue from the jaws of the aforementioned cats, and a gang of tough raccoons who shake them down for kibble on the porch every summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure id="attachment_2000474213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000474213" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-2000474213" src="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/adamant.jpg" alt="Lightspeed logo" srcset="https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/adamant.jpg 440w, https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/adamant-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 2rem), (max-width: 1258px) calc((100vw - 3.68rem) * 2 / 3), 800px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000474213" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;© Adamant Press&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Please visit &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://bit.ly/lightspeedpresents"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lightspeed Magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to read more great science fiction and fantasy.

Researchers found that the fusiform gyrus—a region involved in visual processing—plays a key role in telling reality from imagination, especially when we mentally picture something vividly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fMRI, the team showed that strong activation in this area could lead people to misinterpret imagined images as real, particularly when imagining vivid visual patterns. These findings shed light on how the brain separates internal and external experiences—and how this process may break down in disorders like schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusiform Gyrus Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong activation in this visual area increases the chance of mistaking imagined images for real ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imagination Can Override Reality:&lt;/strong&gt; When mental images are vivid, the brain may treat them like real perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prefrontal Cortex Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The anterior insula helps evaluate whether an experience is imagined or real, working with the fusiform gyrus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of the brain that help a person differentiate between what is real and what is imaginary have been uncovered in a new study led by UCL researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, found that a region in the brain known as the fusiform gyrus – located behind one’s temples, on the underside of the brain’s temporal lobe – is involved in helping the brain to determine whether what we see is from the external world or generated by our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110705"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and an apple." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/imagination-reality-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study also showed that the fusiform gyrus collaborates with other brain areas to help us decide what is real and what is imagined. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that their findings will increase understanding of the cognitive processes that go awry when someone has difficulty judging what is real and what is not, such as in schizophrenia, and could eventually lead to advancement in diagnosing and treating these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Nadine Dijkstra (Department of Imaging Neuroscience at UCL) said: “Imagine an apple in your mind’s eye as vividly as you can. During imagination, many of the same brain regions activate in the same manner as when you see a real apple. Until recently, it remained unclear how the brain distinguishes between these real and imagined experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers asked 26 participants to look at simple visual patterns while imagining them at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, participants were asked to look for a specific faint pattern within a noisy background on a screen and indicate whether the pattern was actually present or not. A real pattern was only presented half of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, participants were also instructed to imagine a pattern that was either the same or different to the one they were looking for, and indicate how vivid their mental images were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the patterns were the same, and participants reported that their imagination was very vivid, they were more likely to say they saw a real pattern, even on trials in which nothing was presented. This means they mistook their mental images for reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants performed the tasks, their brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This technology enabled the researchers to identify which parts of the brain showed patterns of activity that helped distinguish reality from imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the strength of activity in the fusiform gyrus could predict whether people judged an experience as real or imagined, irrespective of whether it actually was real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When activity in the fusiform gyrus was strong, people were more likely to indicate that the pattern was really there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, activation in the fusiform gyrus is weaker during imagination than during perception, which helps the brain keep the two apart. However, this study showed that sometimes when participants imagined very vividly, activation of the fusiform gyrus was very strong and participants confused their imagination for reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior author, Professor Steve Fleming (UCL Psychology &amp;amp; Language Sciences) said: “The brain activity in this area of visual cortex matched the predictions from a computer simulation on how the difference between internally and externally generated experience is determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Dijkstra added: “Our findings suggest that the brain uses the strength of sensory signals to distinguish between imagination and reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the fusiform gyrus collaborates with other brain areas to help us decide what is real and what is imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, activity in the anterior insula – a brain region in the prefrontal cortex (the front part of the brain that acts as a control centre for tasks such as decision making, problem solving and planning) – increased in line with activity in the fusiform gyrus when participants said something was real, even if it was in fact imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Fleming said: “These areas of the prefrontal cortex have previously been implicated in metacognition – the ability to think about our own minds. Our results indicate that the same brain areas are also involved in deciding what is real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results offer new insights into what might go wrong in the brain during psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia where patients struggle keeping apart imagination and reality. The findings may also inform future virtual reality technologies by identifying how and when imagined experiences feel real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was conducted in collaboration with Professor Peter Kok (Department of Imaging Neuroscience at UCL) and former UCL Masters student Thomas von Rein. The study was funded by grants from the European Research Council and Wellcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this imagination and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8fffa1fbe0e2edfccffaece3a1eeeca1fae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Poppy Tombs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Poppy Tombs – UCL&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.05.015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A neural basis for distinguishing imagination from reality&lt;/a&gt;” by Nadine Dijkstra et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neural basis for distinguishing imagination from reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans are able to imagine scenarios that are decoupled from the current environment by internally activating perceptual representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although an efficient re-use of existing resources, it remains unknown how human observers classify perceptual signals as reflecting external reality, as opposed to internal simulation or imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we show that judgments of reality are underpinned by the combined strength of sensory activity generated by either imagery or perception in the fusiform gyrus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activity fluctuations in this region predict confusions between imagery and perception on a trial-by-trial basis and interact with a frontal brain network encoding binary judgments of reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that a key mechanism through which the brain distinguishes imagination from reality is by monitoring the activity of the mid-level visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings increase our understanding of failures of reality testing and lay the foundations for characterizing a generalized perceptual reality monitoring system in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:15:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE82cjhTMjhOTkhLU1lxcjBhWjBoRWl4LTVvTDc4Xy1CdS0yajhqUWZPd1JreF85RjEwYk9HbEJkdVU4M3ljd2k1bWo3ZFFYYzUyMFJXQ1Z1bmpsbWllNWI4NkdDYmFKMmFmQ25HOE5n</guid></item><item><title>加拿大婴儿早产并伴有麻疹死亡-《卫报》 | Canadian infant born prematurely and with measles dies -

                                    &lt;span id="StoryTextTop"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                                
                                
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 17 million people across the US, UK, Germany, and France are living with the most aggressive form of fatty liver disease and have no idea, a new study suggests. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a severe progression of a broader condition now known as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which typically affects those drinking little or no alcohol, per the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/05/millions-in-west-do-not-know-they-have-aggressive-fatty-liver-disease-study-says"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The disease is closely linked to type 2 diabetes, obesity, and conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. About 5% of the global adult population and 4% of the US population is estimated to have MASH, which leads to liver scarring and increases the risk of cirrhosis, kidney disease, and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Researchers found that fewer than one in five people with MASH actually have a diagnosis, which means the majority are unaware they have the disease. The study, published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancet Regional Health Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, calls for diagnosis rates to double from 2022 levels to prevent a sharp rise in health costs and personal suffering. Non-invasive screening methods like blood tests and MRI scans are now available, leading researchers to recommend screening for people with type 2 diabetes, obesity plus risk factors, or persistently high liver enzymes.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Experts warn that if identification and treatment don't improve, both health and economic consequences will escalate. Calls for increased use of weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro in MASH treatment are growing, as these medications can help curb calorie intake, prompt weight loss, and potentially reduce liver scarring. The study also notes that the diabetes drug dapagliflozin may help reduce liver fat and fibrosis, highlighting the growing potential of medication as part of the solution.

&lt;p&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious diseases to affect humans, and can linger in the air for up to two hours. People who visited an exposure location should monitor themselves for symptoms for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial symptoms include a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes. The red facial rash typically appears about four days after someone becomes contagious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who visited an exposure location and develops symptoms should call ahead before seeking medical care, so their provider can protect other patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado public health officials say people who visited the following locations — in Denver, Aurora, Glendale, Windsor, Colorado Springs and Grand Junction — are still in the window during which they could develop measles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walgreens&lt;/strong&gt;, 18461 E. Hampden Ave., Aurora, from 10 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. May 23; or 10 a.m. to 12:10 p.m. May 25. Symptoms could develop through June 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/strong&gt;, 880 S. Abilene St., Aurora, from noon to 3:30 p.m. May 25. Symptoms could develop through June 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural Grocers&lt;/strong&gt;, 3440 S. Tower Road, Aurora, from 6 to 8:10 p.m. May 25. Symptoms could develop through June 15.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love’s Travel Stop and Carl’s Jr.&lt;/strong&gt;, 748 22 Road, Grand Junction, from 6 to 10 p.m. May 27. Symptoms could develop through June 17.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maverick Gas Station&lt;/strong&gt;, 2588 Airport Road, Colorado Springs, from 9 to 11:30 a.m. May 28. Symptoms could develop through June 18.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trader Joe’s&lt;/strong&gt;, 661 Logan St., Denver, between 9:30 and 11:40 a.m. May 29. Symptoms could appear through June 19.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;King Soopers&lt;/strong&gt;, 1520 Main St., Windsor, between 10:30 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. May 31. Symptoms could appear through June 21.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Target&lt;/strong&gt;, 4301 E. Virginia Ave., Glendale, between 9:20 and 11:50 p.m. June 2. Symptoms could appear through June 23.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Kennedy Jr. recently declared that he will greatly expand people’s access to experimental and alternative medical treatments, even while acknowledging that a “lot of charlatans” are likely to take advantage of suffering people as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.theultimatehuman.com/podcast-episodes/robert-f-kennedy-jr-how-to-fix-americas-health-crisis-as-hhs-secretary"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; the announcement during a recent interview on the Ultimate Human Podcast hosted by Gary Brecka, a self-proclaimed biologist, biohacker, and longevity expert (Brecka appears to &lt;a href="https://agemed.org/cme-conferences/florida-april-2020/faculty/gary-brecka-human-biologist/#:~:text=Gary%20has%20a%20BS%20in%20Biology%20from%20Frostburg%20State%20University%20and%20a%E2%80%AF%E2%80%AFBS%20in%20Human%20Biology%20from%20National%20College%20of%20Chiropractic."&gt;possess&lt;/a&gt; two bachelors’ degrees in biology, but is not a licensed medical doctor). Kennedy stated that, under his reign as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Americans will more easily be able to get their hands on treatments not currently approved by health regulators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you want to take an experimental drug—you can do that, you ought to be able to do that,” Kennedy told Brecka.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While many patient advocates in general have pushed for looser regulations surrounding experimental or off-label treatments, other experts have &lt;a href="https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20200303/right-to-try-a-wellintentioned-but-misguided-law"&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; that it’s important to strike a balance between improved access and safety. And it’s unlikely Kennedy’s approach will meet that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For starters, Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-thought-anti-vax-was-bad-these-are-rfk-jr-s-most-disturbing-beliefs-about-health-2000524995"&gt;long spread misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines (one of the most effective medical interventions ever created), nutrition, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-spews-even-more-nonsense-on-autism-covid-in-latest-interview-2000592116"&gt;other health topics&lt;/a&gt;. And he’s no stranger to backing &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt; that have next to no evidence supporting their use. During this latest interview, for instance, he referenced chelation and stem cells as unproven therapies that people should have easier access to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stem cell medicine is a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/groundbreaking-stem-cell-therapy-repairs-badly-damaged-corneas-and-improves-sight-2000571015"&gt;legitimate and growing field&lt;/a&gt; of research. But direct-to-consumer stem cell clinics often exaggerate their benefits, claiming stem cells can treat everything from cancer to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/stem-cell-therapy-clinics-long-covid-risks-cost-1850967572"&gt;long covid&lt;/a&gt;. In recent years, this cottage industry has exploded in the U.S. and overseas, and some patients have been severely injured from buying into the hype. People have experienced pulmonary embolisms, bacterial infections, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shady-stem-cell-therapies-can-cause-tumors-infections-1844543918"&gt;other serious complications&lt;/a&gt;, including blindness, from visiting these clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The risk-balance equation is arguably even worse with chelation therapy. Chelation involves using drugs that bind to heavy metals in the body, allowing them to be excreted out through urine. It’s an effective treatment for certain kinds of acute poisoning or toxic exposures. But in alternative medicine circles, &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/medical/study-gets-heart-controversial-chelation-therapy"&gt;chelation&lt;/a&gt; is regularly used to “cleanse” people of supposed toxins dubiously blamed for a bevy of chronic illnesses, including autism. As with stem cells, people have gotten hurt or &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5508a3.htm"&gt;died&lt;/a&gt; after taking chelation for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK seems to be fully aware of the potential danger that would come with making these treatments easier to access, yet brushed that off as inevitable during his interview.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“And of course you’re going to get a lot of charlatans, and you’re going to get people who have bad results,” he said. “And ultimately, you can’t prevent that either way. Leaving the whole thing in the hands of pharma is not working for us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has previously warned the public to stay away from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism#:~:text=These%20products%20claim,life%2Dthreatening%20outcomes."&gt;chelation therapy for autism&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/be-aware-potentially-dangerous-products-and-therapies-claim-treat-autism"&gt;unregulated stem cell treatments&lt;/a&gt;, but who knows if these warnings will stay up for much longer. Kennedy and the Trump Administration have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/moderna-pulls-promising-covid-flu-combo-shot-as-rfk-continues-antivax-campaign-2000606078"&gt;repeatedly undermined&lt;/a&gt; approved medical treatments like vaccines. Now he’s set to open the floodgates for unlicensed drugs that may not work or will harm people desperate enough to use them.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

						Four cases of suspected botulism linked to cosmetic injections are being investigated on the South Shore, according to an advisory from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.The cases are linked to cosmetic botulinum toxin, commonly known as Botox, injections, which are widely used for cosmetic purposes to reduce wrinkles and fine lines. "While generally safe when administered by trained professionals, improper dosing, administration technique, or use of non-FDA-approved products may increase the risk of systemic botulism symptoms," the Mass DPH’s advisory said. Botulism is a rare, and sometimes fatal, disease caused by botulinum toxin. Initial botulism symptoms can include double or blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing and difficulty breathing. These symptoms could be followed by a descending, symmetric muscle weakness that progresses over hours to days.Anyone who is experiencing any of these symptoms should immediately go to the emergency room.

Nearly all (97.5%) were taking semaglutide, while 2.5% were on lixisenatide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study did not exclude any specific brand of drugs, but since Wegovy was only approved in Canada in November 2021, primarily for weight loss, it is likely the bulk of semaglutide users in the study were taking Ozempic, which is prescribed for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Each patient on semaglutide or lixisenatide was matched with two patients who also had diabetes but were not taking the drugs, who shared similar characteristics such as age, gender and health conditions. The researchers then compared how many patients developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study found that those who had been taking semaglutide or lixisenatide for at least six months had twice the risk of developing macular degeneration, compared with similar patients who were not taking the drugs. Patients who had been taking GLP-1 RAs for more than 30 months had more than three times the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Diabetic patients who were older and/or had had a stroke had an even higher risk of developing macular degeneration if they were on these drugs, the authors found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Marko Popovic, a co-author of the study and physician in the department of ophthalmology and vision sciences at the University of Toronto, said: “GLP-1 receptor agonists appear to have multiple effects on the eye, and in the case of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the overall impact may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Based on our data, I would advise exercising particular caution when prescribing GLP-1 RAs to older [diabetic] patients or those with a history of stroke, as both groups were found to have an even higher risk of developing [the condition].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1599?guestAccessKey=3bb97cc4-36f2-4679-807b-4741de2fa139&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;accompanying editorial&lt;/a&gt;, Brian VanderBeek, an associate professor of ophthalmology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said the findings suggested that large numbers of patients could be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This suggests as many as one in 1,000 GLP-1 RA users could progress to new age-related macular degenaration over unexposed patients: if this risk was carried over millions of users, those affected could end up being a sizable group of patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;VanderBeek said work needed to be done to determine if this only affects patients with diabetes or if those taking these drugs for weight management or other indications are similarly at risk. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic and Wegovy, said: “Patient safety is our top priority and we take any report about an adverse event related to the use of our medicines very seriously. We work closely with authorities and regulatory bodies from around the world to continuously monitor the safety profile of our products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“These medicines have been extensively examined in Novo Nordisk’s robust clinical development programs, including randomised controlled trials, which to date have not shown any observable treatment difference compared to placebo for macular degeneration or age-related macular degeneration. Therefore, Novo Nordisk does not conclude a causal relationship between GLP-1 RA use, semaglutide and age-related macular degeneration at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer of the Medicines &amp;amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, a UK watchdog, said: “Macular degeneration is not currently listed as a potential side-effect of these medicines. However, we keep the safety of these medicines under close review, including emerging evidence from scientific publications, and will take appropriate action where necessary. On the basis of the current evidence, the benefits of GLP-1 RAs outweigh the potential risks when used for the licensed indications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPRXEza3pxVmo5REtJWjZ1YWEzYzdUeXA3R1o2OEVpTS10WWR5UHA3YUQxN3hCMlJmOEI0dWFHWElCNHZpZVR1c0YtREctUUlVd3BpNXctcjVkM0V6TVlvX3Y5SngyM3RfOWlFSHQ4b1NfbzZ6NlJDNE1yNUxVNFVqVHgzdmJudDhFU2dyejdZSVhLa2lqcnpTTXVuWkQwYWVlZWhCS2hITG12UkNv</guid></item><item><title>用于新冠疫苗注射， mRNA可能有助于摆脱艾滋病毒的身体-《纽约时报》 | Used in Covid Shots, mRNA May Help Rid the Body of H.I.V. - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFAxMGxGSkdWSEVweFVONnNRVmNjRVhzX1B4UDNRbE5HZ0NhTU1FVEszN280U2JLTWNuWHQzNHlkTkNDb2c3RjlhQjdPR05HZ1I2NE9uRDl3WFgwNW5TZ0xqQ2pNdTBQTkxNWVRGNw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The technology that powered Covid vaccines may also lead scientists to a cure for H.I.V. Using mRNA, Australian researchers said they were able to trick the virus to come out of hiding, a crucial step in ridding the body of it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The research, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60001-2" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt; in Nature Communications, is still preliminary, and so far, has been shown to be successful only in a lab. But it suggests that mRNA has potential far beyond its use in vaccines as a means to deliver therapies against stubborn adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Short for messenger RNA, mRNA is a set of instructions for a gene. In the case of Covid vaccines, the instructions were for a piece of the coronavirus. In the new study, they are for molecules key to targeting H.I.V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Dr. Sharon Lewin, director of the Cumming Global Center for Pandemic Therapeutics in Melbourne, who led the study, called mRNA a “miraculous” tool “to deliver things that you want into places that were not possible before.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Vaccines deploying mRNA instruct the body to produce a fragment of the virus, which then sets off the body’s immune response. In the United States, the shots were initially hailed for turning back the pandemic, then viewed by some with suspicion and fear. Some officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have falsely said that they are highly dangerous and even deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccines-children-pregnant-women-rfk-jr.html" title=""&gt;sought to limit the vaccine’s availability&lt;/a&gt; to pregnant women, children and healthy younger adults.

E coli, salmonella and listeria can easily transfer from raw produce, meat and eggs to other points we touch, such as a refrigerator or faucet handle, where Wang’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJVrCnjL4a8&amp;amp;t=920s" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown they may be able to linger for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To avoid cross-contamination when cooking, wash your hands frequently and well – for 20 seconds under warm water, then dry them on a clean towel reserved especially for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Do not rinse raw&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;meat, such as chicken, she says. Doing so may help spread harmful bacteria, including via tiny airborne water droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanitize surfaces: &lt;/strong&gt;Dr Jae-Hyuk Yu, a professor of bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, recommends using a bleach solution (one tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water), an Environmental Protection Agency-registered kitchen disinfectant, or an alcohol-based spray for sanitizing hard surfaces, especially after preparing raw meat. And when handling cleaning chemicals, use gloves and ventilate well. He recommends cleaning fridge shelves monthly and ensuring your fridge is consistently under 40F to prevent bacteria from lurking around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f89ece10-bcd1-4d62-ab5a-120dc7602cf3" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Are microplastics really in everything – even my brain?","elementId":"f89ece10-bcd1-4d62-ab5a-120dc7602cf3","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/ng-interactive/2025/apr/30/microplastics-what-to-know"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook meat thoroughly: &lt;/strong&gt;Always cook meat to its proper internal temperature, per the United States Department of Agriculture’s &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/safe-temperature-chart" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;: 145F for whole cuts of beef, pork, lamb, veal and fish (with a three-minute rest for meat), 160F for ground meats, and 165F for all poultry. Yu uses plastic cutting boards, rather than wood, for meat. “Even clean boards can harbor microbes in grooves,” he says, so wash any kind of board well with hot water and antibacterial soap after use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="replace-or-clean-kitchen-sponges-and-dishcloths" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace or clean kitchen sponges and dishcloths&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sponges are notorious bacterial reservoirs,” says Yu. “Cleaning a knife used on raw chicken with a sponge, then using that same sponge on other dishes, can absolutely spread dangerous pathogens.” If you must use a sponge, microwave it, wet, for one to two minutes once a day or run it through the dishwasher with a heat-dry cycle, he advises. Yu replaces kitchen sponges every one to two weeks, and personally prefers sanitizable dishcloths that can be changed daily and put through a hot laundry cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="thaw-meat-properly" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thaw meat properly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While it is convenient to thaw frozen meat at room temperature, doing so “allows the outer layers to enter the ‘danger zone’ between 40F and 140F, where bacteria can multiply rapidly, long before the center is thawed,” says Yu. Instead, thaw meat in the refrigerator. If you want to cook the meat immediately, use the microwave or place it in a sealed bag and submerge it in cold water, changing the water every 30 minutes. These methods keep the temperature in a safe range and limit bacterial growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoid-leaving-food-out-overnight" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid leaving food out overnight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Leaving food out at room temperature is “essentially incubating the bacteria that are in that food”, says an Idaho-based microbiologist and medical laboratory scientist certified by the American Society for Clinical Pathology who goes by the &lt;a href="https://morticiaslab.com/en-cad/pages/about" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pseudonym Morticia&lt;/a&gt; to avoid harassment as she shares food science information online. This gives them time to produce enterotoxins that can lead to symptoms like vomiting. “A lot of these toxins are heat stable,” she says. Reheating them may get rid of bacteria, “but the toxins will still make you sick”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Morticia recommends being especially careful with starchy leftovers like rice and pasta, where &lt;em&gt;Bacillus cereus&lt;/em&gt;, a nasty foodborne pathogen, can start to grow within hours if left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"2b5e792f-fe71-4296-8950-c5b47e242b96","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="2b5e792f-fe71-4296-8950-c5b47e242b96" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;If you’re saving food for later, refrigerate it within two hours. If you’re actively eating over time – say, at an indoor party – food can stay out for up to four hours. But in hot outdoor settings such as a barbecue, that window shortens, she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration and USDA &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/food-safety/safe-food-handling-and-preparation/food-safety-basics/leftovers-and-food-safety" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; keeping refrigerated leftovers no longer than three to four days. “If you freeze food, it will stay safe to eat for a very long time,” Morticia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pay-attention-to-best-before-dates" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘best before’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; dates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Respecting these dates is one of the best ways of avoiding potential health problems,” says Dr Alvaro San Millan, an expert in bacteria at the National Center for Biotechnology in Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some foods, such as packaged snacks, may be fine to eat days or weeks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;after their best before date has passed, particularly if they are unopened or have been properly stored. But it’s not always easy to tell if something has gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If food smells or tastes funny, that’s definitely a red flag,” says San Millan. But pathogens can accumulate without alerting our senses to trouble. “Certain bacteria, such as salmonella, can produce infections in humans even if they are at a very low concentration in the food – so low that you could never appreciate any change in a sniff or taste test,” says San Millan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Most of the time, eating questionable food will probably only lead to some gastrointestinal discomfort, but “if you are unlucky and get infected by bacteria such as listeria or salmonella, or intoxicated with botulinum toxin, you may be in serious trouble,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-24" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mold can send microscopic threads throughout the cheese, contaminating more than what is visible on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“For hard cheese such as cheddar, you can cut off at least 1in around and below the mold spot and keep using it,” Wang says, because fungi aren’t able to spread as quickly through denser textures. “The knife should be kept away from the moldy part to avoid cross-contamination,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-rely-on-spices-salt-or-acid-to-keep-food-safe" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t rely on spices, salt or acid to keep food safe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People have used food preservation techniques like salting and pickling for millennia. But simply adding preservative ingredients to a dish doesn’t “shield” it from bacteria. Spicy, salty or acidic elements might slow spoilage under specific conditions, as with jerky or sauerkraut, but don’t guarantee protection from harmful pathogens. There have been listeria and salmonella outbreaks from pickles, for instance, notes Morticia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="dont-assume-organic-food-is-safer" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t assume organic food is safer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There isn’t much of a difference in regard to bacterial contamination and pathogen transmission” when it comes to organic and conventional produce, Morticia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c2004a57-78b8-4c43-8098-87c1b7547f95" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":33,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Four tips for home care, from vacuuming your mattress to … cleaning your dishwasher?","elementId":"c2004a57-78b8-4c43-8098-87c1b7547f95","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/30/four-tips-for-home-care"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, when buying local, “the supply chain is a lot shorter and fewer people are coming into contact with that food,” she says.

Common food categories such as meat, eggs, shellfish, sprouts, greens and seeded vegetables such as tomatoes and cucumbers are all &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8135230/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;relatively high-risk&lt;/a&gt; for contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Now is a good time for consumers to be more cautious,” says Yu, particularly with “high-risk foods like leafy greens, especially bagged lettuce”, which is prone to contamination with pathogens such as salmonella, listeria and E coli because of the way the greens are mixed from different farms and mass-processed before packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Morticia has changed her eating habits to prioritize safety in light of weaker industry regulations. “I went vegan in January, because most foodborne pathogens are zoonotic in origin, meaning they come from cows and pigs and chickens,” she says. She’s also opting for more stir-fries and fewer salads. “Cooking all of my foods significantly lowers risk,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPMURxTUcxTmlGcUVsQW55d0tWaVh1ZVFTcW1nSXZ1QlJ2S21UcEgzMVVYMlFteEpOWjdlbGhGQkM4VGpjVTlhc24ycW9MY3lRRVlmX0x5V25tcjMxclozMkVjODN6dHpZcDJLTnYyRmNhU2ZXNDBTb2QtT1pHR3BILXVLcHNBTEEtU1dYdDhRZUhpeGJoQVExVGxZbmxVZw</guid></item><item><title>2年的运动逆转了20年的心脏衰老：有史以来最长的运动随机试验-好消息网络 | 2 Years of Exercise Reversed 20 Years of Aging in the Heart: Longest-Ever Randomized Trial on Exercise - Good News Network</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2AFBVV95cUxOUUdfYndNeWZueUhicV9qZzdfTnNsX3VVOU0tSDBia295MzEta0x3LXJYVkU2alBSS1pEYmh3bVhKMXQ3TGczNHZuRkVQcUJCdU5yZ2xMMFpnOC1sT0NRakk1R0xOLWxnVl80WGRkTXhwd0FRWnJmckw0OGRZRFZoQXh3T2dmQ3JmUkVLejVLY1ZQZU1kY3A3d2xCTFdpcGU3T0o4OWpEUDZpMlNuSHNJTlQteFF2LUx1a1Bndll1eHFELUhOVFdiRmRrdFFGS1ZRTHZhU3dtQUY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise was in the news recently for being found in an epidemiological study to reduce the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what should be in the news is that a study published 7 years ago is going somewhat viral on the internet thanks to the profile of a popular health influencer, Dr. Rhonda Patrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6332782/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study found&lt;/a&gt; middle-aged adults could reverse 20 years of age-related decline in their heart muscles through a 2 year exercise program, and that it effectively turned sedentary 55-year-olds into 30-year-olds when viewed through heart activity monitoring equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being that heart disease is the leading cause of death for most people in the United States, and cardiac strength is inversely correlated with heart disease, it’s probably one of the most significant studies on exercise ever carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wit, the authors describe their trial, which took 61 people and put them on an exercise regimen for 2 years, as the longest, randomized controlled trial documenting the physiological effects of supervised, structured exercise on cardiovascular health ever performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were mentioned above: 2 years of work created a heart capable of working as hard as a 30-year-old’s, as if 20 years of aging had been reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_218739" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-218739" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-218739" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1024x683.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-326x217.jpg 326w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews-530x353.jpg 530w, https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/pickleball-credit-Jon-Matthews.jpg 1125w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-218739" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;– credit Jon Matthews&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training program started light and gradually grew in intensity and duration, with months 6-10 representing peak output. The second year was characterized by a “maintenance period” of moderate intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="This Rarely-Trained Muscle Is Recognized Worldwide as a Marker of Human Health–And the Test for Living to 100" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/this-rarely-trained-muscle-is-recognized-worldwide-as-a-marker-of-human-health-and-the-test-for-living-to-100/" rel="bookmark"&gt;This Rarely-Trained Muscle Is Recognized Worldwide as a Marker of Human Health–And the Test for Living to 100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken down, it involved specifically two interval training sessions per week, along with one hour of “base pace,” which focused on a fun activity like low to moderate-intensity sports, cycling, or hiking. At peak training load, participants were training 5–6 hours per week, while during the maintenance period of the latter 14 months, that was dropped to about 4 hours, and included the removal of one of the two interval training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It bears mentioning that even the lower intensity maintenance phase involved more training than typical government prescriptions of two-and-a-half hours. But as study author Benjamin Levine said on Dr. Patrick’s show, exercise should be thought of as personal hygiene—to be done with the same routine urgency as brushing one’s teeth or showering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point the authors &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.117.030617" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;made&lt;/a&gt; is that a measurement of fitness in middle age is the strongest predictor of future heart failure, and men and women of middle age who have had a lifetime of exercise behind them enjoy heart health closer to that of a 30 year old. But their study showed this could still be achieved in middle age even without a lifetime of exercise—in fact, just 2 years were required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXERCISE IS MEDICINE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="High Levels of Physical Fitness Linked to Lower Dementia Risk in Those with Genetic Predisposition" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/high-levels-of-physical-fitness-linked-to-lower-dementia-risk-for-genetic-predisposed/" rel="bookmark"&gt;High Levels of Physical Fitness Linked to Lower Dementia Risk in Those with Genetic Predisposition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also points out, however, that there are limits to exercise’s abilities of age reversal and the heart’s capacity to forgive a lifetime of sedentary behavior. If moderate-intensity training programs are started age 65 or later, they do not appear to be able to overcome the damage—specifically the heart stiffening and shrinkage—from past sedentary periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests for physicians and clinicians that middle-aged hearts retain some degree of cardiac plasticity, and may represent a more optimal time—or quite simply the last time—to intervene with aggressive lifestyle modification aimed at improving cardiac health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;HKU5 was first discovered in 2005 in a species of bat called the Japanese house bat (Pipistrellus abramus), but only recently did scientists realize it can use ACE2, the same protein that allowed Covid-19 to enter human cells and infect millions worldwide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another theory points to a wet market, where dozens of animals were kept in squalid conditions, possibly serving as an intermediate host before the virus jumped to humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study published in the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60286-3.epdf?sharing_token=M_fyPpicsSi90ieoUVpsvdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MpJemnpboKpSy-Zw9PA9tV_-v8PA1nXzDlGTQ0NifJwD3Ei0bkgI1x3xtkoSHh4hV0i3yI2ZtbKyJbSSGmVFpaXlfHtzPEv8M87AIqSmuxYs1fAIGKvHljCW6afDXw5AA%3D"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, focused on a lesser-known group of coronaviruses known as merbecoviruses, which includes HKU5 and MERS-CoV, the virus responsible for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MERS spreads from camels to humans and has a fatality rate of about 34 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To visualize the virus's structure, scientists used cryo-electron microscopy, a high-resolution imaging method that allowed them to examine the spike protein in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that key parts of the spike remained in a 'closed' position, which makes infection more difficult, but not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These viruses are so closely related to MERS, so we have to be concerned if they ever infect humans,' Letko said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While there's no evidence they've crossed into people yet, the potential is there and that makes them worth watching.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, scientists in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00144-8"&gt;Wuhan&lt;/a&gt; reported that&lt;span&gt; one strain of HKU5, Lineage 2, could already bind to human ACE2 receptors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That means it might infect human cells without needing to evolve further.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, US researchers have broadened the investigation, studying the entire merbecovirus family, not just one strain, but dozens, including MERS-CoV and multiple HKU5 variants, to better understand their potential to infect human cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lineage 2 appears more immediately dangerous, already equipped to enter human cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this new study reveals that several other type of HKU5 viruses may only be a few mutations away from doing the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:24:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么一些过敏专家希望这种流行的药物消失-德撒律新闻 | Why some allergy experts want this popular group of drugs to go away - Deseret News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxNbDVVMUFtamlMLWpKc01BTnFpend6UGpDUVAzeVpYbkxZbWtzdVo3SGtiNUZCV3VWMlF3a043eFB4bUpwZFgwbTFnUkF6dzFkMF93Ni04UXB4T2J4Yzk5ODJBV21Fc2NPa2xHc3FjMTNZajNhREVTYzdsQ1FaZ0ZWMkJNVFBnSHNQc0ZONG1sdVdzWWJYN1FoVXAyT1lPNFA3U2diQkVfaDgtREFJZVg2YlNQZEEyV0RJNWd3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Several allergy experts have proposed retiring first-generation antihistamine diphenhydramine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second-generation antihistamines have fewer side effects and work as well as their predecessors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diphenhydramine is recognized to have high adverse side effects, particularly in children and older adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Some allergy specialists are questioning whether one of the most familiar and oldest antihistamines, diphenhydramine, needs to be retired in favor of second-generation drugs that have fewer side effects and work as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The World Allergy Organization Journal published “&lt;a href="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.worldallergyorganizationjournal.org/article/S1939-4551(25)00002-X/fulltext"&gt;Diphenhydramine: Is it time to say a final goodbye&lt;/a&gt;” in February, but as experts have shared it with each other and increasingly discussed it on social media, the paper’s getting more attention now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The paper was written by Dr. James H. Clark and Dr. Robert M. Naclerio, both of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and by Dr. Eli O. Meltzer of the University of California, San Diego and La Jolla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They wrote that medications have a natural life cycle as better ones are developed and said the drug “has reached the end of its life cycle.” They recommend eliminating it as an option, but at least removing its over-the-counter availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the paper, “Diphenhydramine, once a pioneering antihistamine, is now overshadowed by second-generation antihistamines with similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects. Current data suggest that the adverse side-effect profile of diphenhydramine is higher among children and older adults. This has led to countries such as Germany and Sweden restricting access to first-generation antihistamines and societal guidelines advocating for the use of second-generation antihistamines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Canadian Society of Allergy and Clinical Immunology also says first-generation antihistamines should be behind-the-counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More than 300 different formulations exist, most of them over-the-counter. Perhaps the best-known branded version is Benadryl. The paper notes diphenhydramine is also in Sominex and some combination medications like Robitussin Severe Multi-Symptom Cough Cold + Flu Nighttime and Sudafed PE Day/Night Sinus Congestion products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers noted that “diphenhydramine’s problematic therapeutic ratio has been known since the 1980s, and this significant disadvantage has not to date succeeded in stopping over a million prescriptions being written each year. The behind-the-counter status would help the pharmacist suggest safer alternatives and hopefully prevent many adverse consequences, including abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Better-second-generation-options" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Better second-generation options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The newer drugs target antihistamine receptors, while the earlier drugs are “non-selective” and bind to many more receptors throughout the body. That’s why side effects can be related to so many different organs and parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There are, per the journal paper, many safer alternatives. And price is not an issue with second-generation antihistamines, either, it noted. They cost about the same and can be purchased almost anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Of a drug’s life cycle, the authors wrote: “Over time, as a medicine’s usage grows, its indications may be expanded, and its safety profile becomes better understood. Eventually, competition from newer medications with equal or better efficacy or fewer adverse events exceeds the comparative risk-benefit ratio of the earlier medication, often decreasing it to the point where it should be retired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among the possible adverse effects of diphenhydramine noted in the journal are urinary retention, drowsiness, dizziness, hallucinations, cognitive problems, blurry or dry eyes, tachycardia, heart arrhythmia, skin flushing, dry mouth and constipation. The paper says diphenhydramine can interfere with sleep, and also notes “its demonstrated abuse potential.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Researchers wrote about the TikTok "&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.15149" target="_blank" rel="" title="Opens in a new tab or window"&gt;Benadryl challenge&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic — which led to deaths and hospitalizations" as proof of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Anything you would use Benadryl for can be replaced with cetirizine (Zyrtec), loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), or [levocetirizine (Xyzal)],” Dr. David Stukus, of Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, wrote &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJXZbtZzOQC/?igsh=MTAzbnZzZnR0aHVvOQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="" title="Opens in a new tab or window"&gt;in an Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; about the paper. “If you’re asking if any of these are safer or better, the answer is YES!!!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He continued, “Can I use one of these for an acute allergic reaction? Yes! Hives? Yes! Seasonal allergies? Yes! What if I take one of these daily and need another one? Yes! The answer is going to be yes!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Other studies have found some risks, as well. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-to-increased-dementia-risk-20150128812" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/common-anticholinergic-drugs-like-benadryl-linked-to-increased-dementia-risk-20150128812"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; wrote that “common anticholinergic drugs like Benadryl are linked to increased dementia risk.” While the study, published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, noted the research didn’t prove causation, there was an association that increased with how often and how long the drug was used. The report also noted that it is known that anticholinergic drugs increase fall risk and also confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Anticholinergic drugs include not only some antihistamines including diphenhydramine, but also some tricyclic antidepressants, overactive bladder medications and some drugs for Parkinson’s disease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="What's-next-for-diphenhydramine" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What’s next for diphenhydramine?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But per &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/115904?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2025-06-04&amp;amp;mh=f42c31c1ee10f5640c538e4d39fa8d62&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4uybD98Z3SthRPdc7EWyJhxVFG2NKDApV1jZV7zXp_dWEalDli3qg3TndT53kDGaPgOXBjgpBe2ywz5M8b8Naih9sC1LL3UjOZ7MkC-esD2UdiE%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Evening%20-%20Randomized%202025-06-04&amp;amp;utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/115904?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2025-06-04&amp;amp;mh=f42c31c1ee10f5640c538e4d39fa8d62&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4uybD98Z3SthRPdc7EWyJhxVFG2NKDApV1jZV7zXp_dWEalDli3qg3TndT53kDGaPgOXBjgpBe2ywz5M8b8Naih9sC1LL3UjOZ7MkC-esD2UdiE%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Evening%20-%20Randomized%202025-06-04&amp;amp;utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition"&gt;MedpageToday&lt;/a&gt;, experts call it unlikely that diphenhydramine will leave the U.S. market.

She calmed herself, but it was far from the last panic attack that would strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@han.schw/video/7333417939091164459?lang=en&amp;amp;q=adhd%20medication%20side%20effects&amp;amp;t=1749044936593"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;: ‘Then that started happening every day. The worst one probably lasted about two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I couldn’t walk. My friends had to carry me to pee.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on to say she had gone to the emergency room for her panic attacks, a common response people have to the sense of chest-tightening panic that mimics a heart attack, four times over the next few months, but doctors were stumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her mom then suggested something that had not occurred to Schweikert previously: stop taking Adderall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Starting on a low dose to avoid typical side effects like anxiety and insomnia, she instead faced an alarming reaction that spread numbness from her toes to her face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘At this point, I had no feeling in my entire body,’ Schweickert said. ‘It had been 22 days with no feeling. So all my nerves, something was wrong with them.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors would test her ability to feel touch on her arms, head, and legs, and according to them, everything seemed normal. She said they were not concerned and let her leave without any answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So she took it upon herself to figure out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert stopped taking her Adderall for a week, something doctors do not generally recommend because the withdrawal symptoms can be intense, causing depression, anxiety, headaches, muscle aches, and sleep disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some of her numbness subsided in that time. She continued her research, having seen a study that found rats given Adderall at high doses experienced considerable changes in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2017 study, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304394017300022"&gt;Neuroscience Letters&lt;/a&gt;, studied rats given 10mg of amphetamine (a key component of Adderall) and an antidepressant called desipramine, which extends the stimulant's effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The rats’ dopamine levels plummeted and stayed low for seven days after a single dose. In addition to producing feelings of motivation and reward, dopamine can regulate pain and sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the researchers also found evidence of other neurotoxic effects in rats that could potentially explain Schweickert's reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adderall is a powerful stimulant that alters levels of neurotransmitters in the brain to improve focus, attention, and impulse control&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicine starved the rats' brain cells of their energy source within an hour, making it impossible for nerve cells to send signals. This could lead to Schweiker's initial feelings of having a dead limb or tingling.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medicine then overstimulated their brain cells by flooding the brain with glutamate, a chemical that can be toxic in high amounts. In humans, this could lead to hyperexcited nerves burning out, causing paralysis or numbness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drug also caused a chemical 'explosion' in the brain that wiped out the brain’s natural defenses against antioxidants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, the destruction of the chemical in the brain that acts as a fire extinguisher against harmful substances called free radicals can cause nerve pain and numbness, particularly in the arms and legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's the only thing that I found on the internet in a study that I was like, actually this could be what's happening to me,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she had never heard of someone having ‘allergic or neurotoxic effects’ from Adderall, but added, 'there must be someone in the world who's also experienced this.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The feeling in Schweickert’s body did not return completely, even after six months without taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘[I got] really nervous that my feeling would never return,’ she said. ‘Now I can say that it has.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Schweickert stopped Adderall for a week—against medical advice due to withdrawal risks like depression, fatigue, and headaches—some numbness faded. But it took months for the numbness to subside completely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are few studies that delve into the potential &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-12532385/Adderall-overdoses-kids-ADHD.html" class=""&gt;brain-poisoning effects&lt;/a&gt; of stimulants, including Adderall and Ritalin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Ingalla, an Arizona-based nurse practitioner of psychiatry, told DailyMail.com if Schweikert had taken other drugs recreationally, their effects could have compounded Adderall’s tendency to constrict blood vessels, thereby reducing blood flow and causing numbness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingalla said: ‘If she tried this med recently after a psychedelic or other drugs, it wouldn't be an unusual reaction because of additive effects those drugs can have on vasoconstriction and the sensory systems of the brain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Schweickert did not say in the video whether she had been taking any other medication or drug at that time.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures for the number of children taking Adderall or other ADHD medications are hard to pin down due to differences in prescription databases, changing trends over time (due to &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11328263/Stark-graph-shows-Adderall-prescriptions-DOUBLED-pandemic.html"&gt;the Adderall shortage&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, for instance), state-by-state variations in reporting, and the rise of telehealth prescriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6118829/ADHD-surged-70-percent-20-years-study-finds.html"&gt;current estimates&lt;/a&gt; say that around 10 percent of American children, aged two to 17, have been diagnosed with ADHD, and 62 percent of them are being treated with medications, translating to about 4.5 million children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 18:15:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPMktoYWxWTGwyNGJxc3BvcE9tc25LbTlXelVWWW5uSlNlYk9ZeFFsNy1KMFhvZFUtOW53anhpdE55U0hoc3BSZ0F6LXRKWU04TlJzNU9LZDZvY2pPTE9QLUVhUDdKYm8xakhwQ2tZYjJUMG1ZaWEwSU5FdDRPLUNDMGI0VHNHN1BRcWxUU2hGbkd4OExyQ3BaUmc5Rkc0bEnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUG0tRmU5dTQ4R3RCUjkyR3RjaW9rMl9GZy1nblNVakxSSFdDRUJLMm5wUk9aTVUyWkJnNVQ1alB3VkNhMkdLSlJ4YzhGV1F6VW4ybTBmX3l0MzhYVk52R2I0cm91Sm9ta3pHRlE5V2RaT2JScXo0cnNuaDdQdkZyU2dDTU5yQkJDVDhDNUVMdXJacHN2aHVpekFCVFVFMS1wT2pFeEw</guid></item><item><title>牛磺酸可能不是我们所希望的抗衰老奇迹- Gizmodo | Taurine Might Not Be the Anti-Aging Miracle We Hoped For - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPX1NPUWdpWmFldktKQ3FBQjRueWp1SWVsZHJTNlpaU0VnWjZaeC05Z0Y0UDk0QXJtV1JPc3l6WFVkR0RaUU04VmhaZFJaNXdNa29VWTNHUXBnVEdPM1VXRkxXUzhHbVVjOHN5ODZFT1VjSlhfQjdIb0ZTc2duMWpFMnlEZ3IyS2Q5Nm9VdWFucDM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;You might want to hold off on stockpiling taurine supplements as part of your anti-aging cocktail. Research published today failed to find evidence that our levels of taurine shrink as we get older, contrary to some earlier studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health led the research, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adl2116"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in Science. They analyzed long-running data from past human, mice, and monkey studies, finding that taurine levels didn’t change much over time and widely varied between individual animals. The results suggest that taurine isn’t a good marker for age and throw into doubt the idea that it can prolong healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="timeline" data-v-234a609b=""&gt; &lt;p class="text" data-v-234a609b=""&gt;“Circulating taurine doesn’t decline with age in healthy individuals of these three mammalian species across the adult lifespan,” said lead study researcher Maria Emilia Fernandez, a postdoctoral fellow in the Translational Gerontology Branch of the NIH’s National Institute on Aging, in a press conference Tuesday announcing the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taurine is a semi-essential amino acid and important micronutrient. Our bodies naturally produce taurine, though it can also easily be found in animal products, supplements, and energy drinks (people once collected taurine from bulls, but it’s now &lt;a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/energydrink/is-taurine-made-from-bulls-testicles"&gt;produced&lt;/a&gt; synthetically). Taurine &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3501277/"&gt;plays&lt;/a&gt; many roles in the body, such as helping us make bile acid and keeping our blood pressure stable. In recent years, some studies have indicated that taurine—or rather, the loss of taurine—might also be a key driver of our worsening health as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2023 study that looked at several different animal models, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that taurine levels circulating in the blood declined as the animals aged. When the researchers added taurine supplements to the animals’ diets, it appeared to slightly extend the lifespan of mice and worms in addition to improving the health of older monkeys. The study also found an association between lower taurine levels in humans and an increased risk of age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though this wasn’t the first research to suggest taurine’s anti-aging potential, it certainly sparked people’s attention, including the authors behind this latest research. Not every bit of research on the topic has supported this link, however, and many studies have only analyzed taurine in people and animals at a single point in time or for a relatively brief period. The researchers behind the new study wanted to take a closer look at how these levels fluctuated over time across different species and in both males and females.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They turned to other existing studies or projects involving people, mice, and rhesus monkeys that had longitudinal data on taurine levels in the blood—meaning they could track these levels across the lifespan. Overall, they found that taurine levels didn’t decline in any of the animals or humans they studied; if anything, taurine levels usually increased over time in different groups (the sole exception being male mice). They also found that differences in taurine levels between individuals could sometimes vary significantly, and that these differences were usually larger than the changes seen over an animal’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, there doesn’t appear to be much of a connection at all between taurine and aging, at least in this research. “On the basis of these findings, we conclude that low circulating taurine concentrations are unlikely to serve as a good biomarker of aging,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are still findings from a single study, so more research will be needed to settle the question. The results also don’t mean that taurine isn’t important to our health. And it is still possible that low taurine levels can contribute to chronic health problems, including conditions that become more common as we age. Likewise, there may be some older people with low taurine who would benefit from increasing their intake.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Vijay Yadav, one of the authors behind the 2023 study, and his colleagues are currently running a randomized clinical trial testing whether taurine supplements can improve the health and fitness of middle-aged adults. He expects the trial to conclude by the end of 2025, with analysis coming soon after. For now, though, Yadav isn’t saying that people should be downing taurine like it’s candy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We cannot really recommend any supplementation. We need to have a better understanding if it does or it does not [improve health]; that can only be addressed by a placebo controlled trial,” said Yadav in the same press conference Tuesday. “And of course there are a lot more questions that need to be addressed before you can really understand the biology to more depth of a particular molecule.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While there are certainly things people can already do to stay healthier into their golden years, such as exercising regularly, the track record for anti-aging drugs or supplements overall remains spotty for the time being. And it seems that a universal fountain of youth—if we can ever truly find it—probably won’t contain any taurine.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For optimal absorption, CoQ10 supplements should be taken with a meal containing fat. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While time of day doesn’t matter for absorption, taking it in the evening may make it harder to fall or stay asleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always speak with health care professional before taking new supplements to ensure they’re safe and align with your health needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a powerful compound that supports energy production and helps protect cells from damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s become increasingly popular, thanks to its potential benefits for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;, fatigue, fertility, skin health, exercise performance and chronic migraine headaches.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Levels of CoQ10 decline with age, making CoQ10 supplements particularly appealing for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-longevity-11681539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;.

She explains that:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubiquinone &lt;/strong&gt;is the more common, well-studied and often more affordable form found in supplements. However, it needs to be converted into ubiquinol in the body to be fully active, and that conversion becomes less efficient as we age or in people with chronic health conditions like diabetes or heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;·&lt;strong&gt;Ubiquinol&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, is more bioavailable—meaning it's absorbed more efficiently—and may be the better option for adults over the age of 40 or individuals with absorption issues. The downside is that it tends to be more expensive and less shelf-stable than ubiquinone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; CoQ10 supplements are available in various forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, gummies and soft gels, with dosages typically ranging from 30 mg to 600 mg of CoQ10 per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Always consult a health care professional before you begin taking the supplement to determine the appropriate dose for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-coq10-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for CoQ10 Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no scientifically agreed-upon best time of day to take CoQ10. Instead, &lt;a href="https://wenatal.com/pages/our-story" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lisa Dreher, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, recommends taking CoQ10 with a meal containing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826162/13-healthy-high-fat-foods-you-should-be-eating/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dietary fat&lt;/a&gt; to optimize absorption and support meaningful increases in circulating CoQ10 levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “CoQ10 is a fat-soluble compound, so it absorbs best when taken with dietary fat like avocado, olive oil, nuts, eggs or salmon,” expalins Hacatoryan, adding, “Taking it with your largest meal of the day may enhance absorption even further, possibly because those meals tend to have more fat and a longer digestive window,” says Hacatoryan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While the makeup of your meal appears to be the most important factor for optimizing absorption, it’s worth noting that because CoQ10 supports energy production, some people experience an energy boost after taking it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For this reason, Dreher suggests taking CoQ10 before 2 p.m. so it doesn’t interfere with your sleep.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-for-maximizing-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips for Maximizing Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few additional strategies for getting the most out of your CoQ10 supplement: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split the Dose:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacatoryan and Dreher recommend splitting your daily dose into two smaller doses, twice per day, to help keep CoQ10 levels steady. Hacatoryan suggests that this may also help with absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opt for Soft Gels:&lt;/strong&gt; Hacatoryan recommends oil-based soft-gels, rather than powder capsules. “[Soft gels] tend to absorb better than dry powder capsules or tablets, especially when taken with food,” she explains. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair with Vitamin C or Selenium: &lt;/strong&gt;Research suggests that CoQ10 supplements containing&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; have a longer shelf life and are more readily absorbed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Similarly, some studies suggest that selenium may improve CoQ10 absorption and amplify its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects when the two are taken together.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay Consistent:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the most important factors for reaping the benefits of CoQ10 supplements is taking them regularly. To avoid missing a dose, Hacatoryan recommends taking your supplement at the same time every day—and ideally at your fattiest meal. Setting a reminder on your phone or placing the bottle in a hard-to-miss spot in your kitchen may also help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-potential-side-effects-and-considerations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Potential Side Effects and Considerations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; CoQ10 supplements are generally well-tolerated and considered safe for healthy adults. There have been reports of minor side effects, including nausea, vomiting, stomach upset and diarrhea. Some people have also reported mild insomnia when taking doses of 100 milligrams or more. In rare cases, dizziness, headache and heartburn might also occur.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “These side effects are often triggered by higher doses, which is why we always recommend starting low and slowly increasing the dose, if a higher dose is warranted,” says Dreher.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Hacatoryan, CoQ10 supplements are not safe or appropriate for everyone. CoQ10 can interact with certain medications, including:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Blood thinners (like warfarin)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Antihypertensive medications (blood pressure-lowering drugs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some chemotherapy drugs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Due to a lack of research on safety, CoQ10 supplements should also be avoided during pregnancy and chestfeeding. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to maximizing the absorption of CoQ10, experts agree that it’s best to pair your dose with a meal containing healthy fats. While there is no proven ideal time to take your supplement, avoiding taking it after 2 p.m. may help prevent sleep disturbances if you’re sensitive to its stimulating effects. If you’ve been recommended to take a high dose, consider splitting it into two smaller doses—such as with breakfast and lunch—to maintain steady CoQ10 levels throughout the day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most importantly, always consult a health care professional before taking any new supplements. While CoQ10 has been linked with benefits for health, it isn’t safe or necessary for everyone.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best time to take CoQ10 is with a meal containing dietary fat to optimize absorption. You may also find that it’s best to take your supplement in the morning or afternoon to avoid disrupting sleep, especially if you are sensitive to its stimulating effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Splitting larger doses into two smaller ones, opting for oil-based soft gels (rather than powder-based capsules) and choosing supplements that also contain vitamin C or selenium may further support absorption and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to absorption, there doesn’t appear to be a benefit of taking CoQ10 in the morning versus at night, or vice versa. However, some people may find taking CoQ10 in the evening disrupts their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Cumberland County Animal Services confirmed a case of rabies in a fox Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A home inspector was completing an inspection of a crawl space under a home off Garden Court in Fayetteville when he was bitten by an adult fox. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Animal services confined, captured and euthanized the fox. The fox’s remains were sent to the N.C. State Public Health Lab, where it was tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The home inspector is receiving medical treatment. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This is the second case of confirmed rabies found in &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/state/cumberland-county-rabies-case-april-2025/"&gt;Cumberland County&lt;/a&gt; in the last two months. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It is the third reported in the last month in the Triangle, after a man strangled a coyote and later &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/coyote-attacks-roxboro-man-rabies-positive-person-co-health-officials-may-2025/"&gt;tested positive for rabies in Roxboro&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/raleigh-rabies-wild-fox-june-2025/"&gt;wild fox found in Raleigh&lt;/a&gt; also tested positive, though it is believed it had no contact with other humans or animals.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There is no confirmation that these cases are linked. &lt;/p&gt;

If pets are not vaccinated or are due for a booster shot, they should be taken to a local veterinarian for rabies vaccination immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The first sign of rabies in animals is usually a change in behavior. Signs of rabies in animals can include aggressive behavior, attacking for no reason, or becoming very quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wild animals can lose their fear of people and seem tame. Rabid animals may walk in a circle, drag a leg or fall over. Some cannot swallow, are unable to eat or drink, and often drool. Animals usually die within a week after first becoming ill.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wildlife experts advise people to make loud noises and wave their arms to scare away any suspicious wildlife. Here are some other tips to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should not approach animals that they do not know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Residents should ensure their pets have a current rabies vaccination. If a pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is recommended. Outdoor pets should be kept inside until they receive booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from animals you don't know. Teach children to do the same. "Love your own, leave others alone!" is a good rule to remember.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report stray animals to your local animal control office.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

It says that 90 percent of patients diagnosed with nAMD are considered legally blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the condition, new, abnormal and fragile blood vessels grow on the macula — an area in the center of the eye behind central, high-resolution, color vision — and may then leak blood and fluid onto it, causing damage and loss of vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it isn't clear exactly what causes the condition, the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests that it could be due to shifts in hormones in the eye sparking the growth of more blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1455?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525"&gt;JAMA Opthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, scientists extracted data on 139,000 adults in Ontario, Canada, from the ICES database — which collects data on patients in the province from public sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All of the patients had type 2 diabetes, and they were 66 years old on average. Some 46 percent were female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 46,000 were prescribed a weight loss drug like Ozempic for at least six months — while the rest took different diabetes drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over three years, researchers recorded 93 cases of nAMD in the weight loss drug group (or 0.2 percent of patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in the group not using the drug, there were 88 cases (or 0.1 percent of patients).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Real Housewives of New Jersey star Dolores Catania admitted to using Ozempic to lose weight for the six weeks ahead of the RHNJ reunion.

He has lost vision in both his eyes after taking the weight loss and type 2 diabetes medication Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said: 'An explanation for the increasing risk with prolonged exposure is that the retina contains receptors for GLP-1, and [these] are known to increase the levels of CXCL12.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said CXCL12 is a substance that attracts white blood cells, with this possibly causing the growth of new blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of the patients, 97 percent were reported to be on a semaglutide — which includes semaglutide — while the rest were on lixisenatide — brand name Adlyxin.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists started tracking the individuals between January 2020 and November 2023 for up to three years on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic's maker Novo Nordisk is already facing several lawsuits from people who say that the drug robbed them of their sight — including Todd Engel, a 62-year-old type 2 diabetic who lost vision in his right eye just four months after he started using the shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, his doctors had no clue the jabs could be linked to it, and dismissed it as a coincidence — leading him to continue to use them. Six months later, he also lost vision in his left eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say the damage is permanent and that Engle will never see again —  with the most he can perceive being faint pinpricks of light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was diagnosed with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION, a rare condition that cuts off blood flow to the optic nerve and causes permanent vision loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Todd Engel is pictured above with the grandchildren and one of his children while on a family outing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now blind in both eyes, the 62-year-old has been forced to give up his job as a motor equipment operator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At home, his family has installed special push-button controls for the microwave and television — devices he can no longer see, but can still hear.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says he was never warned of the potential risk — and believes he would have reconsidered the drug had he known the danger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engel had lived with type 2 diabetes for more than 25 years, and had been taking medication to manage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His lawyers say he had no history of eye problems, and routinely passed the annual vision tests required for his job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Engel’s Attorney Ashley Hornstein, from the law firm Motley Rice, told the Daily Mail: ‘The tragic thing about this case is that he had no idea this was even a possibility with the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He stayed on Ozempic for another five or six months after the vision loss happened the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If he hadn't, it's quite likely that he would still have vision in one eye today — that is all part of this horrific tragedy.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:31:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNNlJvWmJLUE8wb0l6MVJEZjQ4bTVtOW9IbFBsMjg2aW5XUnhIbGtjb1hKLThqMktpUFdBZ1pJZ3hFTzNZTXJJZmNvT0NBeUFIU1pQN2k3aTBsQnRJSlYtSHA2TlFhVzNYSzZ6QTdqdVVzdzJEc2swWjV6NHdxV1FfbV9JQlE5d2FDQmplQzlKdXRjY0hzRlUza2FWUTNwQzRCb2tadGZQRHBUMjJY</guid></item><item><title>这种草药与更好的记忆力、降低焦虑和防止阿尔茨海默氏症有关-《独立报》 | The herb linked to better memory, lower anxiety and protection from Alzheimer’s - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxOR0FsUk9fMDdFaVRUU1h3NTJPaWpmQ0MyZ2tvYXBkRzlkd1lRVjJGY004Z1NjWExCUlE5OGVxLUtacElhWTU4ZHlBUnBENHdFYUVkZHNMZ1VMUjB5c3BNSzJDVnMwTGZiTWduRTJBaGdSUW10aVJYcXBVM1V2dUt2aGZZR3hXc2M5VTFSZ1dMdnhGTjVxelRvS0V3QlQ1b01jS0doSVFTMVN4NDJ0Q2ZoQzB1dVFoMmdZR3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

But beyond its culinary charm, rosemary is also gaining recognition for its impressive health benefits, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="/topic/brain-health"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;, inflammation and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests rosemary may even hold promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of &lt;a href="/topic/dementia"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, rosemary has been linked to &lt;a href="/topic/memory"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; and mental clarity. In ancient Greece and Rome, students and scholars used rosemary in the hope of sharpening concentration and recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern science is finding there may have been something in this: in one study, people who inhaled rosemary’s scent performed better on memory tasks compared to those in an unscented environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does rosemary work on the brain? There are several mechanisms at play. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 eVrEhv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/06/27/09/iStock-182890157.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/06/27/09/iStock-182890157.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/06/27/09/iStock-182890157.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) is the aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-69081"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) is the aromatic herb native to the Mediterranean&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, rosemary stimulates blood circulation, including to the brain, helping deliver more oxygen and nutrients, which may improve mental clarity. It also has calming properties; some studies suggest its aroma can reduce &lt;a href="/topic/anxiety"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and improve sleep. Lower stress can mean better focus and memory retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary contains compounds that interact with the brain’s neurotransmitters. One such compound, 1,8-cineole, helps prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine, a brain chemical essential for learning and memory. By preserving acetylcholine, rosemary may help support cognitive performance, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another bonus? Rosemary is packed with antioxidants, which help protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress – a major factor in cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is rich in phytochemicals, plant compounds with health-enhancing effects. One of the most powerful is carnosic acid, an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that helps shield brain cells from harm, particularly from the kinds of damage linked to Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 eTsGOy"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/06/03/14/37/iStock-187272969.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=0%2C0%2C1%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Research suggests rosemary may even hold promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-69082"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Research suggests rosemary may even hold promise in the fight against Alzheimer’s disease&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, researchers developed a stable version of carnosic acid called diAcCA. In promising pre-clinical studies, this compound improved memory, boosted the number of synapses (the connections between brain cells), and reduced harmful Alzheimer’s related proteins like amyloid-beta and tau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s especially exciting is that diAcCA only activates in inflamed brain regions, which could minimise side effects. So far, studies in mice show no signs of toxicity and significant cognitive improvements, raising hopes that human trials could be next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also believe diAcCA could help treat other inflammatory conditions, such as &lt;a href="/topic/type-2-diabetes"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/topic/cardiovascular-disease"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary’s benefits could extend well beyond the brain. It’s been used traditionally to ease digestion, relieve bloating and reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compounds like rosmarinic acid and ursolic acid are known for their anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body. Rosemary may even benefit the skin – a review suggests it can help soothe acne and eczema, while carnosic acid may offer anti-ageing benefits by protecting skin from sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary oil also has antimicrobial properties, showing promise in food preservation and potential pharmaceutical applications by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, rosemary is safe when used in food, teas or aromatherapy. But concentrated doses or extracts can pose risks. Consuming large amounts may cause vomiting or, in rare cases, seizures – particularly in people with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a theoretical risk of rosemary stimulating uterine contractions, so pregnant people should avoid high doses. Because rosemary can interact with some medications – such as blood thinners – it’s best to check with a healthcare provider before taking large amounts in supplement form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is more than just a kitchen staple. It’s a natural remedy with ancient roots and modern scientific backing. As research continues, particularly into breakthrough compounds like diAcCA, rosemary could play an exciting role in future treatments for Alzheimer’s and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, adding a little rosemary to your life – whether in a meal, a cup of tea, or a breath of its fragrant oil – could be a small step with big health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dipa Kamdar is a Senior Lecturer in Pharmacy Practice at Kingston University.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) causes fibrosis (scarring) and can lead to cirrhosis and is linked to greater risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the vast majority of people do not know they have the condition. An international group of researchers examined prevalence and diagnosis of aggressive fatty liver disease in the US, UK, Germany and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The researchers found that just under 3% of people in the UK, France and Germany, and 4% of those in the US have MASH, but diagnosis rates were below 18%. That means about 20 million people in the US, UK, Germany and France are living with MASH but only 2.5 million people have a diagnosis, leaving more than three-quarters – about 16.7 million people – unaware they have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(25)00112-7/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report, published in the Lancet Regional Health Europe&lt;/a&gt; and presented at the meeting of the global thinktank on &lt;a href="https://sldthinktank.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;steatotic liver disease&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona, Spain, on Thursday, calls for a doubling in diagnosis rates from 2022 levels. Traditionally, MASH was diagnosed through biopsy, but now non-invasive methods such as blood tests, ultrasound and MRI scans can be used. As a result, everyone with type 2 diabetes; obesity combined with one or more other risk factors; and those with persistently high liver enzymes should be screened for MASH, the researchers conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jeffrey Lazarus, the lead author of the paper and a professor of global health in New York and Barcelona, said: “Undiagnosed MASH costs economies billions of pounds in lost productivity and poor health. Unless diagnosis rates are doubled, alongside similar increases in treatment and care, direct health costs alone are predicted to triple over the next 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Emmanouil Tsochatzis, a professor of hepatology at University College London and a consultant hepatologist at the Royal Free hospital, said: “More than 15 million people across the US and Europe have the deadliest form of fatty liver disease – and don’t know it. Without faster diagnosis and access to treatment, the human and economic toll will skyrocket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research has also prompted renewed calls for weight loss jabs to be used to treat MASH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="09bdb291-d451-4594-9049-402eb0ec18e2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":10,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Contraception warning over weight-loss drugs after dozens of pregnancies","elementId":"09bdb291-d451-4594-9049-402eb0ec18e2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/05/contraception-warning-over-weight-loss-drugs-after-dozens-of-pregnancies"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Paul Brennan, a co-author of the Lancet paper and a hepatologist at NHS Tayside, said: “GLP-1s (including Wegovy and Mounjaro) offer the potential to resynchronise our metabolism, by introducing feelings of satiety – fullness – and delaying the time the stomach takes to empty. These effects often result in reduced calorie intake, and improvements in how the liver handles nutrients as a result of weight loss, thus reducing scar tissue formation in the liver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Michael Betel, the president of the Fatty Liver Alliance, said: “Too many people living with type 2 diabetes or obesity are never tested for MASH until it’s too late. We need a huge increase in liver health assessments in patients living with these diseases, alongside lifestyle changes and for some, when appropriate, weight loss drugs to reduce blood sugar and appetite.

Could those suggestions lead to real, testable breakthroughs in the lab? The results suggest the answer might be yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-finds-new-drug-ideas-for-cancer"&gt;AI finds new drug ideas for cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research focused on GPT-4, a large language model (LLM) that is trained on vast amounts of internet text. The team designed prompts that asked GPT-4 to generate pairs of drugs that could work against MCF7 breast cancer cells but not harm healthy cells (&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4493126/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MCF10A&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also restricted the model from using known cancer drugs and instructed it to prioritize options that were affordable and already approved for use in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-shows-better-emotional-intelligence-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not automation replacing scientists, but a new kind of collaboration,” said Dr. Hector Zenil from King’s College London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Guided by expert prompts and experimental feedback, the AI functioned like a tireless research partner, rapidly navigating an immense hypothesis space and proposing ideas that would take humans alone far longer to reach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its first round, GPT-4 proposed 12 unique drug combinations. Interestingly, all combinations included drugs not traditionally associated with cancer therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These included medications for conditions like high cholesterol, parasitic infections, and alcohol dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, these combinations were not arbitrary. GPT-4 provided rationales for each pairing, often tying together biological pathways in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-combos-work-well"&gt;Some combos work well&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step was to test the drug pairs in the lab. Scientists measured two things: how well each combination attacked MCF7 cells and how much damage was caused to MCF10A cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also evaluated whether the drug pairs worked better together than separately, a property known as synergy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three combinations stood out for having better results than standard cancer therapies. One involved simvastatin and disulfiram. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another paired dipyridamole with mebendazole. A third involved itraconazole and atenolol. These drug pairs were not only effective against MCF7 cells, but they worked without overly harming healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Supervised LLMs offer a scalable, imaginative layer of scientific exploration, and can help us as human scientists explore new paths that we hadn’t thought of before,” said Professor Ross King from Cambridge’s Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-and-humans-improve-ideas-together"&gt;AI and humans improve ideas together&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the first set of results, the researchers asked GPT-4 to analyze what had worked and suggest new ideas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They shared summaries of the lab findings and prompted the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-helps-humans-have-20-minute-conversation-with-humpback-whale-named-twain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; to propose four more drug combinations, including some involving known cancer drugs like fulvestrant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, the AI returned combinations such as disulfiram with quinacrine and mebendazole with quinacrine. Three of the four new suggestions again showed promising synergy scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective combinations was disulfiram with simvastatin, which achieved the highest synergy score of the entire study at over 10 on the HSA scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feedback loop, AI suggesting ideas, humans testing them, then feeding results back to the AI, represents a novel way of conducting science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process no longer moves in one direction. Instead, it cycles, with both machine and human adjusting and improving as they learn from each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-found-surprising-cancer-combos"&gt;AI found surprising cancer combos&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the twelve original combinations, six showed positive synergy scores for MCF7 cancer cells. These included unusual pairings like furosemide and mebendazole or disulfiram and hydroxychloroquine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, eight of these twelve combinations had greater effects on MCF7 cells than on MCF10A cells, indicating good specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most toxic drugs to MCF7 cells included disulfiram, quinacrine, niclosamide, and dipyridamole. Disulfiram had the lowest IC50 value, meaning it required only a small dose to reduce cell viability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4’s ability to find such effective non-cancer drugs and pair them meaningfully surprised even the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study demonstrates how AI can be woven directly into the iterative loop of scientific discovery, enabling adaptive, data-informed hypothesis generation and validation in real time,” said Zenil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hallucinations-as-creative-leaps"&gt;Hallucinations as creative leaps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4 sometimes makes mistakes. These are called hallucinations, statements not supported by its training data. In most cases, hallucinations are flaws. But in hypothesis generation, they can be productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, one such hallucination involved the claim that itraconazole affects cell membrane integrity in human cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is true for fungi, human cells do not use the same biological pathway. Yet, this flawed idea still led to successful experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The capacity of supervised LLMs to propose hypotheses across disciplines, incorporate prior results, and collaborate across iterations marks a new frontier in scientific research,” said King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ai-may-help-tailor-cancer-treatments"&gt;AI may help tailor cancer treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team believes that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-can-alert-doctors-when-patients-might-get-sicker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; and lab automation could eventually reduce the cost of personalized medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment might one day involve a custom research project for each patient. Instead of general prescriptions, therapies could be tested and tailored in near real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of running a lab remains high, but AI like GPT-4 drastically cuts down the time and effort required to generate useful hypotheses. With further advances in robotics, the physical testing process might also become cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our empirical results demonstrate that the GPT-4 succeeded in its primary task of forming novel and useful hypotheses,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-future-science"&gt;What this means for future science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study shows that AI can do more than summarize or analyze. It can take part in generating new scientific knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GPT-4 didn’t just crunch numbers. It offered unexpected ideas, learned from outcomes, and improved its suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combinations it proposed still need clinical trials. They are far from becoming approved treatments. But their success in lab settings highlights the potential of repurposing safe, existing drugs for new uses, something that could save years of development time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of The Royal Society Interface&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;arXiv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 15:07:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQWWY2My03VGxiaVlaNVFReDhzNG9aU0puRWhTanRjdnowelZVSV9tMkJJOHQ5YWhDd3JSWV9QbkIxZFAwWC0tSXQxc0tva3ZLaUdTTVV6cl9leVJJRWh5cEsxczRJSkxDYXhOeVRjanBxdFk4Q3RVeDhnaWs3Y1BvM01WTFVKQWZMOEdkU0l4elk0UHJ1NWxLYjZ6MmpZU2M4YjhIM3NCMmpGTU9DQ0c3WlFzWlVpUQ</guid></item><item><title>研究发现， GLP-1药物可能与严重眼疾风险升高有关- statnews.com | GLP-1 drugs may be linked to elevated risk of serious eye disease, study finds - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPTkx6akk4bWtlNnNjTHpGaFQ4Rk5ERDItekE4dWk1bW1JY1h5TTdhYUxQX0RBSE01cVRld2RzaTNYTjdyLXl6OE1BOHpqWXJEbjZ6dS11cVo1Ymg3RUxXdUNCYnFBMFJvZTZ4cVdtQlZjRXRJd3EyTndmRXFJV09kaThWUUFSVW5XbGtMQmFHRnd0cUZJSG1kU2ZRX0RlZmdQQzRERUxSekVQZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes who were taking GLP-1 drugs had a low but elevated risk of an age-related eye disease that can sometimes lead to blindness, a new observational study concludes, adding to a short list of concerns about eye health in people taking the powerful medications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2025.1455?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060525" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;, found that after one year, more than twice as many people on GLP-1 drugs developed neovascular age-related macular degeneration compared to similar people who were not taking the drugs. The risk was 0.2% in people taking GLP-1s and 0.1% in those who didn’t. Participants, drawn from health records of nearly 140,000 patients in Canada, were matched for socioeconomic status and a long list of conditions in addition to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AMD is a leading cause of irreversible blindness in older people; the study participants were 66 years old, on average. Neovascular AMD (nAMD) is an advanced form of the disease, known for its abnormal growth of blood vessels and damage to the central part of the retina called the macula. It can be treated with frequent injections to potentially restore or stabilize vision. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People at risk for nAMD share the same conditions — chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease — that make patients with diabetes candidates for GLP-1s. Aware of other eye problems in people taking GLP-1s, researchers looked for a relationship between the drugs and AMD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Seeing such a clear signal in our study was striking,” co-author Reut Shor of the University of Toronto told STAT. “The absolute risk remains low, but the advanced form of AMD is a condition with serious implications for vision and quality of life. So a doubling of risk is clinically meaningful, particularly for vulnerable populations like older adults who may already be at elevated baseline risk.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Famous for their success in helping people lose weight, GLP-1 drugs were originally intended to control their blood sugar. Since then, they’ve shown promise in countering cardiovascular disease, hypertension, Parkinson disease, and substance use disorders. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As their use has taken off, though, more eye problems have been reported, including abnormal blood vessel growth. It’s not unusual for rare side effects to show up when more people take a drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cases of this &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1901118" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;retinopathy&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1607141" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in two studies of people with diabetes, cardiovascular risk, and a history of GLP-1 usage for 20 or 24 months. The risk of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/07/03/ozempic-wegovy-naion-vision-loss-study/"&gt;nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,&lt;/a&gt; when the optic nerve’s blood flow is blocked, was also found to be higher in people on GLP-1s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If there’s a common cause, researchers speculate that it might be plunging blood glucose levels spurred by GLP-1s that trigger abnormal blood vessel growth in the retina. The new study can’t prove that, or even connect cause and effect, its authors emphasize, but their results add to concern about safety and eye health of people being treated for diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diabetes itself has long been known to cause retinal degeneration because of too much blood sugar, something that drugs like the standby metformin have been able to control. The issue with GLP-1s may go beyond blood sugar, though. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are GLP-1 receptors in the retina, the authors write, and GLP-1 drugs increase the levels of molecules that lead to harmful blood vessel formation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new study raises questions about whether direct or indirect effects are driving the increased risk of nAMD. The next steps for the research would ideally include studies in animal models and human tissue to determine the mechanism, as well as large, prospective clinical studies in diverse populations to further clarify causality, Shor said. It would also be important to study people without diabetes who are using GLP-1s for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, Shor said, these results should not cause alarm or abrupt changes in prescribing, but they do warrant greater awareness and appropriate monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means patients should promptly report any new visual symptoms, such as blurred or distorted vision, straight lines appearing wavy, or new blind spots. These symptoms could indicate early signs of AMD, Shor said, and should trigger an immediate referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether discontinuing the drug at that point would lessen risk for AMD remains an open question that future research might answer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brian VanderBeek of the Scheie Eye Institute at the University of Pennsylvania said further research is also needed to pin down the association between the drug and higher rates of eye disease. In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2834967" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;companion editorial&lt;/a&gt;, he points out that follow-up studies of diabetic retinal disease and neuropathy in people taking GLP-1s showed the risks were lower than initially thought. But the new paper does cause concern. If its findings are borne out, he writes, as many as 1 in 1,000 GLP-1 users might develop nAMD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“GLP-1 RAs have had a tremendous role in the care of patients with diabetes and now those needing additional help with weight management,” VenderBeek writes. “While certainly not outweighing the good these medications offer, prescribing physicians need to keep in mind the real and serious ocular adverse events that may occur.”&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yersinia pestis—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;the bacterium that causes the bubonic plague—experienced a genetic tweak that allowed rodents to live longer after they were infected, according to a new study. This alteration may have prolonged two significant plague pandemics, including the deadliest event in human history: the Black Death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at the Institut Pasteur in France and McMaster University in Canada studied hundreds of ancient &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;DNA samples to investigate a gene called “pla.” Their study, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;published May 29 in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt3880"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, identified a decrease in repetitions of the pla gene in the &lt;i&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/i&gt; genome during the later stages of both the first and second major plague pandemics. The researchers believe these pla depletions ultimately allowed these pandemics to last longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first plague pandemic, known as the Plague of Justinian, struck the Mediterranean basin during the sixth century and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1903797116"&gt;&lt;span&gt;caused&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; tens of millions of deaths over the course of two centuries. The second emerged when the Black Death broke out in 1347, killing an estimated 30% to 50% of Europe’s population in just six years. But this was just the beginning. Like the first pandemic, this plague continued to reemerge for centuries, lasting more than 500 years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This newly discovered evolution of the pla gene offers more insight into how these plagues persisted for so long. &lt;span&gt;The pla gene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; appears many times in the &lt;i&gt;Y. pestis’&lt;/i&gt; genome and plays a crucial role in its virulence by allowing it to infect the lymph nodes before traveling to the rest of the body, according to an Institut Pasteur &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/press-area/press-documents/plague-bacillus-became-less-virulent-prolonging-duration-two-major-pandemics"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This causes rapid septicemia—or blood poisoning—and quickly kills the victim. Therefore, a lack of this gene in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/i&gt;strains from the first and second major pandemics likely made the bacterium less virulent, the researchers suggest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To test that hypothesis, they infected mice with three preserved strains of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;from the third major pandemic that also had fewer repetitions of pla. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“These three samples enabled us to analyze the biological impact of these pla gene deletions,” said co-author Javier Pizarro-Cerdá, director of the Yersinia Research Unit at the Institut Pasteur, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through their mouse model, Pizarro-Cerdá and his colleagues found that the pla depletion resulted in a 20% decrease in victim mortality. What’s more, it allowed infected rodents to live significantly longer. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that rats infected with pla-depleted &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;strains may have been more effective disease vectors, as they had more time to spread the plague far and wide before they died. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Rodents—particularly rats—played a critical role in spreading the bubonic plague to humans. People most commonly contract this disease via infected flea bites, and fleas typically contract it when they feed on infected rodents. Thus, an increase in the lifespans of sickened rodents would have provided greater opportunity for fleas to bite them, become infected, and then bite humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ours is one of the first research studies to directly examine changes in an ancient pathogen, one we still see today, in an attempt to understand what drives the virulence, persistence, and eventual extinction of pandemics,” said co-lead author Hendrik Poinar, director of the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre and holder of the Michael G. DeGroote Chair in Genetic Anthropology, according to the statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today, the bubonic plague is considered a rare disease, though a small number of cases still emerge in western North America, Africa, Asia, and South America, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21590-bubonic-plague"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While this research provides valuable insight into the evolutionary history of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Y. pestis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; and the world-altering pandemics it caused, it can also serve as a model for better understanding how deadly diseases emerge and spread, according to the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

            The United States is facing an alarming increase in overdose deaths among young people due to synthetic opioids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2znz4001o3b6mj0axw5gs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids, which include fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, increased &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db491.htm#:~:text=The%20age%2Dadjusted%20rate%20of%20drug%20overdose%20deaths%20involving%20synthetic,rates%20of%20change%20over%20time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 20-fold&lt;/a&gt; between 2013 and 2022, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000p3b6m6ls8f2mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overdoses and drug poisonings are now the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2201761" target="_blank"&gt;third leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in people under age 20, behind firearms and motor vehicle crashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000q3b6mcb6hhoev@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The overdose death counts among US youth ages 15 to 24 rose from 4,652 to 6,723 between 2018 and 2022, according to a &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/155/6/e2024069488/201955/Changes-in-Synthetic-Opioid-Involved-Youth" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Pediatrics. (A slight decrease occurred between 2021 and 2022.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000r3b6m29btblh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The largest increase was seen in deaths involving only synthetic opioids: Since 2020, fatal overdoses involving only these substances were higher than overdoses in which multiple substances were implicated. Overdose rates were nearly 2.5 times higher among male youths compared with female youths and more than two times higher among those ages 20 to 24 compared with those ages 15 to 19.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000s3b6mds1apumy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a parent, I wanted to know more about synthetic opioids and their uses. Why are they so dangerous, and how are overdoses treated? How can people tell if the drugs they are taking contain synthetic opioids? Crucially, what can parents and other family members do to help reduce the risk of overdose?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2w51h000t3b6mx42dmsnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To help us answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. Previously, she served as Baltimore’s health commissioner, where she oversaw the city’s opioid prevention strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi0zbtg00003b6mxy0ltpy0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What are synthetic opioids? What are they used for?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200113b6mmdtxl772@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Prescription opioids are medications used to treat severe pain. They must be used with caution, however, because if they are used in higher than prescribed doses or otherwise incorrectly, they can result in drowsiness, slowed and shallow breathing, and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200123b6mnb5hbjvg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Opioids can be classified by where they originate. So-called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/glossary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;natural opioids&lt;/a&gt; are derived from the poppy plant and include drugs such as morphine and codeine. Semisynthetic opioids include oxycodone and hydrocodone. Synthetic opioids are made in the laboratory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200133b6m0wo5ojkz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The synthetic opioid most implicated in fatal overdoses is &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2" target="_blank"&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. There are other synthetic opioids too, such as tramadol and methadone. Methadone is also used as a treatment for people with opioid use disorder. Notably, the CDC’s statistics and the new study in Pediatrics do not include methadone in their calculation of fatal overdoses due to synthetic opioids. The &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates#Fig2" target="_blank"&gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; of synthetic overdose deaths in the US involve fentanyl or fentanyl derivatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200143b6mlvi9akt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there legitimate medical uses of fentanyl?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200153b6mvdd82i4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. Fentanyl is often used in emergency settings to treat acute pain. For instance, someone who was in a high-speed car accident and just broke their hip needs immediate pain relief. It is also given to patients who have chronic pain that is not relieved by other methods. Some cancer patients with intractable pain use a fentanyl patch or fentanyl lozenge, for example.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200163b6maotuvkhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The current trend of youth overdoses is probably not mostly due to fentanyl being diverted from legitimate medical purposes. In recent years, there has been a significant problem with fentanyl being made in illegal labs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200173b6mi1trpe7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Synthetic fentanyl is sold illegally as a powder dropped onto blotter paper, put in eyedroppers and nasal sprays or, perhaps most terrifyingly, as pills that resemble other prescription pills, according to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/fentanyl" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200183b6mqj36s29c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, fentanyl is often mixed in with other drugs. People who think they are taking amphetamines, oxycodone, cocaine, heroin, MDMA (also known as ecstasy) or other “party drugs” may be unknowingly taking fentanyl. Depending on the amount of fentanyl they are ingesting, they could overdose and die.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf200193b6mytk299qv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What makes fentanyl especially dangerous?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001a3b6mw934cixn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; To begin, fentanyl is an extremely potent opioid. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/24/health/fentanyl-visual-guide/index.html"&gt;50 to 100 times&lt;/a&gt; more potent than morphine. A small amount can lead to oversedation and death. People may not realize how dangerous fentanyl is or even that what they are taking has fentanyl in it. There have been numerous cases of high school and college-age students who have died after being &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/us/campbell-fentanyl-dangers/index.html"&gt;given fentanyl-laced pills.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How are overdoses treated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001c3b6m927ptohh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The treatment for opioid overdose is the medication &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/health/naloxone-opioids-fentanyl-overdose-prescription-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;naloxone&lt;/a&gt;, also sometimes referred to by its brand name Narcan. It is available as a nasal spray and as an intramuscular injection. The nasal spray is available over the counter for under $50. Some health insurance plans will cover naloxone, and some state and local health departments may give out this medication free of charge. If given immediately after someone loses consciousness, it could reverse the overdose and save someone’s life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001d3b6m8crwcgen@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Individuals who come to after getting naloxone should still receive immediate medical care. They may need additional doses of naloxone, and they could need treatment for other potentially dangerous substances they have taken.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001e3b6mz68vcpk3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How can people tell if the drugs they are taking contain synthetic opioids?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001f3b6mdlivo4m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is an important question — the answer is that people can’t easily tell if the drug they are taking contains fentanyl. Counterfeit medications can look exactly like the prescription form. If fentanyl is mixed in with cocaine or other illicit drugs, it’s not possible to tell based on simply looking at the substance, as fentanyl is odorless and colorless.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001g3b6mipurul72@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stop-overdose/safety/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/stopoverdose/fentanyl/fentanyl-test-strips.html" target="_blank"&gt;Fentanyl test strips&lt;/a&gt; can check for the presence of fentanyl in the drug supply. While the use of these strips can reduce overdose risk, know that just because one pill in the supply doesn’t contain fentanyl doesn’t mean that others all don’t. Moreover, these strips don’t test for other contaminants that can also be deadly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001h3b6m0i78vnsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I want to share another key number: Of the fentanyl-laced fake prescription pills analyzed in 2022 by the US Drug Enforcement Administration Laboratory, &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/alert/dea-laboratory-testing-reveals-6-out-10-fentanyl-laced-fake-prescription-pills-now-contain" target="_blank"&gt;6 out of 10&lt;/a&gt; contained a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl. This is a sobering statistic and should be reason enough for people never to use illicit prescription pills or other illegal substances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001i3b6mqimmu2sz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can parents and other family members do to help reduce the risk of overdose?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001j3b6m1yop63id@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Parents should speak with their children about the danger of counterfeit and illicit drugs. It doesn’t matter if parents used drugs when they were younger. Drugs today are so much more powerful and dangerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001k3b6mbcd54dem@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People should never take medications that don’t belong to them. They don’t know where the medications came from, if the medications are really what they claim to be, and whether they have contaminants such as fentanyl in which even a small amount could be fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbi2yyf2001l3b6m8ejupvkk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            I think it’s also good practice to have naloxone accessible. As I mentioned, this medication is now available &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/02/health/naloxone-opioids-fentanyl-overdose-prescription-health-wellness"&gt;over the counter&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone can learn to use it and have it in their medicine cabinet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

These findings challenge previous concerns that the creams could stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells that rely on hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaginal estrogen creams are frequently used to treat menopause symptoms such as vaginal dryness, discomfort and &lt;a href="/life-style/love-sex/painful-sex-discomfort-women-females-reasons-a8756821.html"&gt;pain during intercourse&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of previous concerns, many breast cancer survivors avoid these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed national database records on 18,620 female breast cancer patients aged 65 and older who were diagnosed between 2010-2017, including 800 who used vaginal estrogen creams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gwbiSr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/03/17/iStock-1466762516.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/03/17/iStock-1466762516.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/03/17/iStock-1466762516.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Estrogen creams are often used to treat menopause symptoms" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-11309"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Estrogen creams are often used to treat menopause symptoms&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt;

sheds light on the structural foundations of the brain’s default mode network, a system of regions long associated with internally focused thought, memory, and self-reflection. Using postmortem brain tissue and advanced neuroimaging, researchers found that this network is composed of distinct anatomical types of brain tissue, each with different roles in processing information. The findings help explain why the default mode network is involved in such a wide variety of mental states—from introspection to decision-making—and suggest that its structure enables a unique balance of communication across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default mode network, or DMN, is one of the most widely studied yet poorly understood brain systems in neuroscience. It was originally discovered through brain scans showing that certain regions become less active when a person focuses on an external task, like solving a math problem. But over time, researchers noticed these same regions were also active during a wide range of cognitive activities, such as daydreaming, remembering the past, imagining the future, and even making complex decisions. This unexpected versatility raised fundamental questions about what the DMN does and how it manages to participate in such seemingly contradictory mental functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key to solving this puzzle, the researchers hypothesized, lies in the network’s anatomy. Much of the past research on the DMN has used functional MRI to track patterns of activity, but less attention has been paid to the underlying microstructure that might shape those functions. The authors of the new study believed that a deeper understanding of the DMN’s cellular and anatomical features could clarify how it supports such a diverse array of mental processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The default mode network has a fascinating history in neuroscience. It was first identified as a group of brain regions that become less active when people engage in a specific task,” explained study author Casey Paquola, the head of &lt;a href="https://multiscale-neurodevelopment.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Multiscale Neurodevelopment Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-7) at the Helmholtz Associations’ Research Center Jülich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But over time, researchers noticed that these same regions were actually activated during a wide variety of tasks — from recognizing faces to making decisions. This led to a lot of diverse theories about what the DMN is and what its role is in cognition. So, despite being discussed in tens of thousands of studies since 2001, it remained enigmatic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Notably, the vast majority of those studies used fMRI to study the DMN. As I work at the intersection of neuroanatomy and neuroimaging, I thought it would be a novel angle to investigate this functional entity through the lens of neuroanatomy. We wanted to test whether the hypotheses based on functional MRI were supported or rejected based on the architecture of the DMN.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the research team combined two powerful tools: postmortem brain histology and in vivo neuroimaging. The histological data came from a high-resolution 3D reconstruction of a human brain donated after death, allowing for precise mapping of cell densities and tissue types across the cortex. The team analyzed nearly 7,400 thinly sliced brain sections, stained to reveal the shapes and layers of cells, and reconstructed them into a 3D model known as “BigBrain.” These anatomical maps were then compared with functional brain networks defined by resting-state MRI scans in living participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on how different parts of the DMN varied in their cytoarchitecture—the arrangement and characteristics of cells across different layers of the cortex. They identified several types of cortical microstructure within the DMN, ranging from areas specialized for processing sensory information to regions associated with memory and internal thought. This showed that the DMN is not uniform but rather includes a mix of cell types, each potentially suited for different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data-driven modeling, the team found a spectrum—or axis—of cytoarchitectural variation across the DMN. Some regions had highly layered structures with dense mid-level cell populations, while others had flatter, less differentiated profiles. These differences aligned with known anatomical types, such as eulaminate regions that process external information and agranular areas often linked to self-generated thought and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then examined how these anatomical differences relate to the DMN’s connectivity. By analyzing diffusion MRI data from healthy adults, they assessed how efficiently information could travel along structural pathways linking different brain regions. They found that parts of the DMN with highly layered cytoarchitecture were more strongly connected to other brain regions, particularly those involved in sensory processing. These regions appeared to serve as “receivers,” efficiently gathering input from across the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, areas with flatter cytoarchitecture were relatively isolated from sensory input, suggesting that they form an “insulated core” within the DMN. These more internally focused regions, like the anterior cingulate cortex, may support self-referential processing or maintain mental representations that are less dependent on immediate sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further understand the flow of information within the DMN, the researchers used a modeling technique called regression dynamic causal modeling. This method estimates how activity in one brain region influences another, providing a measure of functional input and output. The results confirmed that “receiver” regions in the DMN received strong input from a variety of other brain systems, while the more insulated areas were relatively unaffected by outside signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most strikingly, the researchers found that the DMN differs from other brain networks in how it sends information back out. While many networks tend to favor certain types of connections, the DMN distributed its output evenly across all levels of the brain’s processing hierarchy—from low-level sensory areas to high-level association regions. This suggests that the DMN plays a unique integrative role, capable of influencing thought and behavior at multiple levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify that these patterns weren’t just artifacts of group-level analyses, the team conducted a replication study using ultra-high field 7-Tesla MRI in individual participants. This allowed them to map microstructural variation and connectivity within each person’s brain. The results were consistent with the earlier findings, supporting the idea that the DMN’s unique structure and connectivity patterns are present at the level of individual brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the DMN is largely expanded in humans relative to other mammals, more so than any other functional network, an interesting take-away from this study is that this unique network of brain regions is capable of enriching our interpretation of the world, by coloring our world view with other types of information, from autobiographical memory or social perspectives,” Paquola told PsyPost. “In other words, this network operates in a very different way to standard sensory processing, and that may help humans to have a richer understanding of the world around us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, there are limitations. The detailed anatomical mapping was based on a single postmortem brain, and while replication was attempted with high-resolution imaging in living subjects, further validation across more diverse samples is needed. The study also focused on healthy adults, leaving open questions about how the DMN might develop during childhood or change in mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will aim to understand how the DMN’s anatomy evolves over time and how it interacts with cognitive development and psychiatric symptoms. For example, if certain subregions mature more slowly or become disrupted in disorders such as depression or schizophrenia, this could help explain why these conditions involve changes in self-perception or thought patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m very interested in how the brain develops, that is how it changes from infancy to adulthood,” Paquola said. “Moving forward, we’d like to understand more about how the maturation of the DMN coincides with cognitive maturation and changes in mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01868-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The architecture of the human default mode network explored through cytoarchitecture, wiring and signal flow&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Casey Paquola, Margaret Garber, Stefan Frässle, Jessica Royer, Yigu Zhou, Shahin Tavakol, Raul Rodriguez-Cruces, Donna Gift Cabalo, Sofie Valk, Simon B.

Scientists discovered unexpected RT activity in neurons of healthy and Alzheimer’s brains, tracing it to truncated LINE1 elements—ancient genetic sequences capable of copying themselves via RT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These monocistronic LINE1 fragments were especially active in gray matter, where neurons reside and accumulate mutations over time. The findings suggest that existing RT inhibitors could be repurposed in clinical trials to help slow or prevent Alzheimer’s disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected Brain RT Activity:&lt;/strong&gt; Reverse transcriptase activity was found in neurons, especially in aging and Alzheimer’s-affected brains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINE1 Variants Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Thousands of previously unannotated, truncated LINE1 transcripts were found to encode RT.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; FDA-approved HIV RT inhibitors may be repurposed for Alzheimer’s treatment through clinical trials.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Sanford Burnham Prebys&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia and affects more than a tenth of Americans aged 65 and older.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys and elsewhere have recently reported real-world links in medical records associating common HIV drugs with a reduced incidence of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies showed patients were at less risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease if they were taking drugs to block a famous enzyme called reverse transcriptase (RT), which copies RNA into DNA, opposite to the classical process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RT is best known from being an essential enzyme allowing HIV and other retroviruses to replicate in host cells, and FDA-approved RT inhibitor drugs prevent HIV reproduction.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the links between Alzheimer’s disease risk and people taking prescribed RT inhibitor drugs, Jerold Chun, MD, PhD, and colleagues at Sanford Burnham Prebys looked for evidence of actual RT activity in the aging human brain and in brains affected by Alzheimer’s disease, identifying RT enzymatic activity, and novel RNAs that encode brain RTs especially in neurons of the aging human brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were published online May 14, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chun lab’s prior landmark publication in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; in 2018 described how RT-mediated somatic gene recombination of the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) gene can occur in neurons of the human brain including those from the most common non-familial or sporadic form of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare familial mutations in the APP gene cause a form of Alzheimer’s disease that can be inherited in families, whereas sporadic disease lacks this inheritance but can be affected by non-inherited “somatic” mutations produced by RT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We asked a basic question: is there actually any RT activity in the aging human brain?” said Chun, a professor in the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Center for Neurologic Diseases at the institute and the senior and corresponding author of the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And, if there is, where does it come from and which brain cells are affected?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists examined post-mortem brain tissue from donors who had died from Alzheimer’s disease and compared it to control samples without obvious disease. RT activity was found within every brain sample, with a trend towards reductions in RT activity in the brains from terminal Alzheimer’s disease. This is consistent with the neuronal degeneration that is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate the origins of this RT activity further, the scientists assessed multiple possible sources and identified long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1), an ancient genetic sequence so common in mammalian genomes that it makes up nearly one-fifth of all human DNA. It is normally inactive, but scientists have found rare forms that are active, using their own RTs to copy and paste themselves elsewhere in the genome.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prevailing thought has been that LINE1 can only function if expressed from an intact, bicistronic mRNA copy,” said Juliet Nicodemus, an MD-PhD student working in the Chun lab as part of the Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of California San Diego and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead, through the use of long-read sequencing of Alzheimer’s disease brains and normal brains, we found thousands of truncated versions of LINE1 expressed in the human brain, including hundreds of sequences not annotated in the human genome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to uncovering abbreviated versions of LINE1, the scientists found that most of these variations contained only one of the two protein-coding regions that appear on a full-length transcript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We demonstrated that these shortened sequences with a single coding region, or ‘monocistronic’ transcripts, are capable of encoding reverse transcriptase activity,” said Chun. “The level of activity from sequence to sequence also varied dramatically amongst variants, beyond 50X.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists addressed their second major question regarding the types of cells with RT activity by comparing samples of neuron-rich gray matter with white matter that contains mostly glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“RT activity was significantly higher in gray matter,” said Nicodemus. “This is consistent with RT activity being predominantly found in neurons and has potentially widespread implications as our post-mitotic neurons accumulate DNA changes over an individual’s lifetime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to continue learning more about the different versions of reverse transcriptase at work in the aging and especially Alzheimer’s disease brain,” added Chun. “This will allow more targeted treatments to be developed in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the proven safety of FDA-approved RT inhibitor drugs, Chun also suggests that physicians and scientists should pursue prospective clinical trials studying these drugs’ effects on persons with early Alzheimer’s disease as a near-term approach to helping Alzheimer’s disease patients and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional authors include Christine S.

L1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons bicistronically express ORF2, containing RT and endonuclease (EN) domains, and RNA binding protein ORF1, together enabling L1 retrotransposition and contributing to somatic genomic mosaicism (SGM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we assessed endogenous RT activities and L1 mRNA diversity from cerebral cortical samples of 31 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and non-diseased (ND) brains (both sexes) using enzymatic functional assays, targeted PacBio HiFi long-read sequencing, and quantitative spatial transcriptomics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expected bicistronic, full-length L1 transcripts were absent from most samples, constituting &amp;lt;0.01% of L1 sequences, of which &amp;gt;80% were non-coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Monocistronic ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts were identified across all samples, consistent with quantitative spatial transcriptomics that identified discordant ORF2 and ORF1 expression in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All brains had RT activity, with AD samples showing less activity, consistent with neuronal loss of terminal AD vs. aged ND donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain RT activity was higher in grey matter and correlated with increased neuronal ORF2 expression, further supporting neuronal contributions. Remarkably, &amp;gt;550 protein-encoding, polyA+ ORF2 sequence variants were identified, over 2x more than identified in the human reference genome (hg38).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental overexpression of full-length and truncated ORF2 variants revealed ∼50-fold RT and ∼1.3-fold EN activity ranges, supporting endogenous functional capacity of monocistronic ORF2 variants in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vast sequence diversity of monocistronic ORF2 mRNAs could underlie functional differences in RT-mediated somatic gene recombination/retroinsertion and resulting genomic mosaicism in the normal and diseased brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 13:55:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9VN1dzWGRHVlNEOFE5bGVad3VVNDJmXzVVRFhsQ29qYXpSVVhOVy1CdGVoSGZYcV82UVZ4RExYOGZkdjBhVUxjUFJ0YUxyY0lqTE5xQXpyVi1fdEtja0RsT2JnVXNod1VlNS1hLUFVVFB2bTQ</guid></item><item><title>美国顶级夏季目的地处于红色警戒状态，因为患有世界上最具传染性疾病的旅行者感染了无数人-每日邮报 | Top US summer destination on red alert as traveler with world's most contagious disease infects untold number - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNOWhOTnEwNjhnbWlHdklwTlppUFJhZmVZa2QtVWhfQWYxRGlqQ3p1TzhJTXdvZHNlYVB3Z3NpaUp0bGxZUUQtYzNrR0d3dGY0N0xCSHM0cUlIUjhvcjBLdUxkVEhuX1JhVzZVLXFlTWZuTkZUSUgyRy0tVElBclJpVVN1WXEwQkhnNTdhR1JkQ28tcTI5UHJNOWlR0gGfAUFVX3lxTFA0NTNBVGYyV1dHMl9CTHA0N1VjMEVFcUc1cHQ5LXFkLURKNGVtcmFsRFlZYnlfbzlMZnhxS0k0eFJ6S21VcVdDRkJWR2lxb2tWV29QR3RMOFBDN3RsaW9kVjJzdVNxZ2dvUWlkTEZGQm9SSF9Ib3F5SjdZNzRneWxYaFVSUmdXNkRjWWZsN04wUTk4aEN6TTNyOEYwcjZQbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A top US summer destination is on red alert after a traveler infected with the world's most contagious disease passed through the state, potentially infecting others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An adult passenger with an&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14772281/US-map-measles-MMR-vaccine-rate-study.html"&gt; active case of measles &lt;/a&gt;traveled through Salt Lake City International Airport multiple times before Memorial Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After landing into Salt Lake City from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/canada/index.html" id="mol-aadd74d0-4212-11f0-856e-d9a98dd1fd0e"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; on May 19, they drove a rental vehicle to a hotel in Burley, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/idaho/index.html" id="mol-aaddc2f0-4212-11f0-856e-d9a98dd1fd0e"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt;, for a business trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four days later, they made the return journey home, taking the same method of transport. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Passengers who were on the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14775791/denver-airport-health-warning-infections-linked-disease-outbreak.html"&gt;individual's flights have &lt;/a&gt;been contacted by the Salt Lake County Health Department, as have guests who stayed at the same Burley hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another out-of-state resident infectious with measles also passed through the southwestern region of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/utah/index.html" id="mol-aade5f30-4212-11f0-856e-d9a98dd1fd0e"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; on May 26 and 27, which has heightened the cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14600461/Where-worlds-infectious-disease-spreading-US-24-states-report-cases.html"&gt;Utah officials are warning anyone&lt;/a&gt; who fears they may have been exposed to contact their health provider and monitor for symptoms in what is the latest in a string of measles scares to rock America's major airports and surrounding neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last reported measles infection in Utah - which is a popular tourist destination for its stunning National Parks including Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion - was in March of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top US summer destination is on red alert after a traveler infected with the world's most contagious disease passed through the state, potentially infecting others&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person who was not vaccinated traveled outside the US and brought measles back to Utah but they weren't believed to have infected anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before that, there were three people in Utah who had measles in February 2017, with one child who was not up-to-date on vaccinations being the one to infect two other unvaccinated individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two fresh Utah cases come as measles cases in the US &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6695579/More-100-cases-measles-confirmed-nationwide-outbreak-fueled-anti-vaxxers-CDC-says.html" class=""&gt;continue to spike&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently there have been 1,088 confirmed measles cases and at least three deaths reported by 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an updated advisory, the CDC is warning that people can get infected with measles during travel or at crowded events, unless they are fully &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7571481/Measles-warning-travelers-flew-Philadelphia-airport.html"&gt;vaccinated or have had the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice reads: 'Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings, including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency recommends that all travelers be fully vaccinated against measles before traveling to an international destination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6753425/How-completely-avoidable-measles-cases-continue-climb.html"&gt;were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-e13a1760-4099-11f0-83cb-973ee3fa2d45"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a recent study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year, which is being &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6063419/Measles-outbreak-sweeping-CDC-reveals.html"&gt;signaled as the cause of the measles resurgence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the MMR vaccine, which is 97 percent effective at stopping infections, measles is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Kaiser Permanente Northern California reveal that adults aged 45 to 49 undergoing their first screening colonoscopy have neoplasia detection rates similar to those aged 50 to 54, supporting recent guideline changes to begin colorectal cancer screening earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Rising colorectal cancer rates among adults under 50 in the United States have prompted a shift in screening guidelines. In 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force lowered the recommended starting age for routine &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer+screening/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer screening&lt;/a&gt; from 50 to 45 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Screening Colonoscopy Yields Among Adults Aged 45 to 49 Years After Lowering the Colon Cancer Screening Age," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2834893" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a screening cohort study to assess detection rates of colorectal neoplasia following the guideline change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cohort included 12,031 adults from Kaiser Permanente Northern California who underwent their first screening colonoscopy between 2021 and 2024. Participants were between 45 and 54 years old and had at least one year of health plan membership before screening. Individuals with a history of colorectal disease, incomplete procedures, or diagnostic indications were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary outcomes included the presence of any adenomas, advanced adenomas, sessile serrated &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lesions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt;, advanced serrated lesions, or colorectal cancer. Detection rates were compared between those aged 45 to 49 (n=4,380) and those aged 50 to 54 (n=7,651).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any adenoma was detected in 35.4% of the younger group and 40.8% of the older group, a statistically significant difference (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.90).&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;All other outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between age groups. Advanced adenomas occurred in 3.8% of younger patients versus 4.1% of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older patients&lt;/a&gt; (aRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75–1.09), while &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; detection was rare and similar in both groups (0.1%; aRR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.15–2.07). Rates of sessile serrated lesions and advanced serrated lesions were also equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening colonoscopy among adults aged 45 to 49 produced neoplasia yields similar to those in older patients, particularly for clinically important lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest that benchmarks for adenoma and serrated lesion detection do not require adjustment based on the inclusion of younger adults. Researchers conclude that the data support the current recommendation to initiate screening at age 45, offering evidence for its broader adoption across &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+systems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This gentle technique significantly improves cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage—a critical function that declines with age and contributes to cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used fluorescent tracers in mice and monkeys to uncover a new drainage pathway connecting facial lymphatics to deep lymph nodes, which remains intact even in older individuals. A handheld device that lightly strokes the skin restored youthful CSF flow in aged animals, opening up exciting potential for wearable treatments that prevent or slow neurological decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Drainage Route:&lt;/strong&gt; Scientists mapped a previously unknown CSF drainage pathway through facial lymphatics to submandibular nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Method:&lt;/strong&gt; Gentle mechanical stimulation of the face and neck enhanced CSF clearance without drugs or surgery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Proof Vessels:&lt;/strong&gt; Superficial facial lymphatics retain function in aging, making them ideal targets for therapeutic stimulation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Institute for Basic Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists at the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) have uncovered a non-invasive method to boost the brain’s natural waste drainage system—a discovery that could open new avenues for tackling age-related neurological disorders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in Nature, researchers from the IBS Center for Vascular Research, led by Director KOH Gou Young, along with senior researchers JIN Hokyung, YOON Jin-Hui, and principal researcher HONG Seon Pyo, demonstrated that precisely stimulating the lymphatics under skin on the neck and face can significantly enhance the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—the liquid that cushions the brain and helps remove toxic waste—through lymphatic vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110671"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and face." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/face-stimulation-gymphatic-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offers a new approach to clearing brain waste using safe, non-invasive mechanical stimulation, rather than relying on drugs or surgical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain produces waste at a high rate compared to other organs, and clearing it efficiently is essential for healthy brain function. This clearance is primarily carried out by CSF, which removes harmful substances such as amyloid-β and tau proteins—key factors in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, as we age, this drainage slows down, contributing to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IBS Center for Vascular Research previously published landmark studies in Nature (2019 and 2024) demonstrating that CSF drains to deep cervical lymph nodes via meningeal lymphatic vessels at the base of the skull and the nasopharyngeal lymphatic plexus. They also showed that age-related degeneration of these lymphatics impairs CSF clearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team found that CSF drainage could be enhanced or suppressed pharmacologically by targeting cervical lymphatic vessels outside the skull. However, clinical applications remained limited because these lymphatics are located too deep in the neck for non-invasive access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research not only completed the map of cerebrospinal fluid drainage pathways that clear brain waste, but also provided a new method to enhance CSF drainage from outside the brain,” stated KOH Gou Young, Center Director and corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect this will serve as a milestone for future research on neurodegenerative diseases including dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, using genetically modified mice and monkeys with fluorescent tracers, the researchers have mapped out a new CSF drainage route from the brain to superficial cervical lymph nodes—via a network of lymphatic vessels in the face, nose, and hard palate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older animals, many of these routes had degenerated—except for the vessels just beneath the facial skin, which retained full functionality despite aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We confirmed that lymphatic vessels beneath facial skin connect to submandibular lymph nodes through various pathways,” explained JIN Hokyung, Senior Researcher and co-first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through these connections, we can regulate the reduced cerebrospinal fluid drainage function seen in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to determine how this newly identified pathway can be applied in actual patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this, the team developed a force-regulated mechanical stimulator—a handheld device that gently presses and strokes the skin in a controlled manner. When applied to aged mice, the device restored CSF clearance to youthful levels, dramatically improving drainage without disrupting natural lymphatic contractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am pleased that we found a safer and more effective method to enhance cerebrospinal fluid drainage from outside the skull,” said YOON Jin-Hui, co-first author and neurovascular physiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are conducting follow-up studies to investigate how this newly identified drainage pathway is altered in various brain disease patients and how this new stimulation method can be applied therapeutically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique could pave the way for wearable or clinical devices that enhance brain waste clearance in older adults or patients with neurological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is now investigating how this drainage system behaves in diseases like Alzheimer’s—and whether mechanical stimulation could serve as a preventive or therapeutic tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;William Suh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ibs.re.kr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

ENCELTO is a surgically implanted device that delivers a steady dose of a neuroprotective protein called CNTF to preserve retinal cells and slow disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals with foundational research from Scripps and the Lowy Medical Research Institute, the device has shown long-term efficacy in clinical trials.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developed by the biotech company Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, ENCELTO’s origins stem from a long-standing partnership between the Scripps Research lab of physician-scientist Martin Friedlander and the Lowy Medical Research Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the 17th FDA-approved therapy to emerge from work at Scripps Research. The device is expected to be available to U.S. patients in June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Lowy family’s commitment to finding a treatment through their extraordinary support of the MacTel Project and the Lowy Medical Research Institute—combined with the work produced by Scripps Research, Neurotech, and an international consortium of scientists and clinicians—is a testament to the power of collaboration and the importance of basic science in developing effective treatments for debilitating diseases,” says Friedlander, whose research, along with that of others, helped pave the way for ENCELTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacTel affects the central part of the retina, which is essential for sharp, detailed vision. People with the disease often have trouble reading, recognizing faces or seeing fine detail—symptoms that gradually worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To slow this progression, ENCELTO delivers a steady dose of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a naturally occurring protein that supports the survival and health of nerve cells—including photoreceptors in the retina. CNTF acts as a neuroprotectant, meaning it helps shield these cells from damage to delay the degenerative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA’s approval was supported by two phase 3 clinical studies showing that the ENCELTO implant slowed the loss of light-sensing retinal cells in people with MacTel over a 24-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devices removed from patients’ eyes after as long as 14.5 years still produced levels of CNTF comparable to what they were producing at the time of implantation, suggesting the device should remain efficacious well beyond the 2 years observed in the trials. This is being examined further in extended phase 4 trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time a cell-based therapy delivering a neuroprotectant has been approved to treat a neurodegenerative disease,” notes Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, Friedlander played an active role in shaping ENCELTO’s scientific foundation and helped lay the groundwork for its clinical development through earlier work from his Scripps Research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacTel was initially believed to be a blood vessel disorder because early imaging showed abnormal, leaky capillaries near the center of the retina. But Friedlander and his lab helped reveal that the real issue was neurodegeneration—the gradual death of photoreceptors and supporting glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a key proof-of-concept study published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Clinical Investigation&lt;/em&gt; in 2009, they showed that gene therapy could be used to deliver a neuroprotectant directly to the retina in a preclinical model resembling the disease, effectively slowing or preventing cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This early success paved the way for further development of ENCELTO. A few years later, a member of the Lowy family was diagnosed with MacTel. The family’s search for a treatment became the driving force behind developing a lasting, targeted therapy for MacTel—which would eventually become ENCELTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on his 2009 findings, Friedlander began looking for a way to deliver CNTF to patients in a safe and sustained manner. He reconnected with Neurotech—a company he had worked with in the 1990s—to explore utilizing one of its devices originally developed to treat other retinal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they explored the use of a tiny, collagen-based capsule containing genetically modified retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, which help nourish the retina and support photoreceptor health. Once implanted in the back of the eye, the device releases CNTF in a controlled, long-term way while shielding RPE cells from attack by the body’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENCELTO is also being evaluated for neurovascular degenerative conditions beyond MacTel. Friedlander’s lab is now exploring its potential to deliver other therapeutic molecules for diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The retina is an extension of the brain, so this also implies that a neuroprotectant could be used to prevent neurodegeneration in other diseases,” says Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that ENCELTO’s success is the culmination of years of research, persistence and problem-solving by many people—from the earliest lab studies to the final stages of clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no greater satisfaction for a clinician-scientist than to be able to find a treatment that will potentially impact hundreds of thousands of patients,” says Friedlander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s tremendously rewarding to take something from the lab bench and actually bring it to the bedside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#89f9fbecfafac9faeafbe0f9f9faa7ecedfc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Press Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scripps.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Press Office – Scripps Research Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 12:36:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE9fZy1fVXRvaTRLejFqdG5DSjE1c25nV1F2NWo5ZWRhcVQ3SGNuMEVueVFuRFFHN1o2TGdRazJFNkpJeHQ2b2o1dUdHbDJrdXRKeEJ2NjMzUzhIU1NkdGMwYnBtOFBOdjZheTI0ZzBoNS1FZDhkQ280YjRUeVpyUHc</guid></item><item><title>为什么女性每年应该喝不超过六杯葡萄酒-《每日电讯报》 | Why women should drink no more than six glasses of wine a year - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5qVEVLRUpreTVOMUNNa2hYeW94QU9INU9vNlF1S2ZmTTh0R09FVFI0TDdoLTJ3TFJHU0pTNGdHa2pKZVhncmREeVdBT2h6U0ZycF9oTlAySjFvbjg5M2V6cl82aG4xVFk1UVNqcVREWkRTM2RnQTUwLUNn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;Women who drink four of these drinks&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;over the course of a weekend, meanwhile, are at a 12 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink. Of 100 women who have four drinks of this size every weekend, around 13 would develop breast cancer over the course of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While having alcohol-free days can improve your health, there are added dangers to drinking large amounts of alcohol in one sitting, says Dr Rumgay. One study she worked on in the past found that “the risk of breast cancer was increased by 40 per cent in women that had had any occasion of heavy episodic drinking in the year leading up to the research,” she says. We might not think of it as such, but the WHO classes “heavy episodic drinking” or binge drinking as consuming 60g of pure alcohol or more in a single drinking session. That’s equivalent to just over two large glasses of wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research into the effects of weekend-only drinking is still ongoing, but “premenopausal women who binge drink seem to be twice as likely to develop breast cancer,” says Prof Stordal. “There is some confidence in the notion that having this carcinogenic compound in your system in high concentrations after a weekend of drinking could be more dangerous compared with having the same quantity over the course of a longer period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink a few times a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink three times a week are at a 9 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink three times a week, around 12 would develop breast cancer over the course of their lives, not including other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a break between the days that you visit the pub or have a glass of wine with your dinner is certainly good for your health, says Dr Rumgay. “Drinking frequently can lead to systemic inflammation of the body,” she explains. “If you cut the number of days that you drink, or spread them out, then it’s possible that your body has more time to recover from this inflammatory state, which could potentially avoid increasing your risk of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even this amount of alcohol can increase your cancer risk, however. Another study that Dr Rumgay worked on found that “having just half a standard drink every day increases breast cancer risk by 4 per cent,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink once a week&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink once a week are at a 3 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink a week, around 11 would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke. The same amount of non-drinking women will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 40 per cent of women in Britain drink at least once a week. The effects of having one drink each week are hard to study, however, as “most people either drink more than once a week or don’t drink at all,” says Dr Rumgay. The numbers still show that even this much alcohol consumption can increase your risk of breast cancer – though you might see a 3 per cent increased risk as something you’re willing to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink a few times a month&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have one drink every other week are at a 2 per cent greater risk of developing breast cancer than women who don’t drink, says Dr Rumgay. Of 100 women who have one drink a few times a month, around would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors such as genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there isn’t a lot of research into this pattern of drinking, though “any amount of alcohol still increases your risk of breast cancer,” says Dr Rumgay. “The simple advice I always give is reduction,” says Prof Stordal. “Whether that’s cutting down to once a week or once every few weeks, whatever you can do will benefit you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;One drink every few months&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who have fewer than six drinks over the course of a whole year are 0.3 per cent more likely to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/breast-cancer-symptoms-signs/"&gt;develop breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; than women who don’t drink. Of 100 women who have one drink fewer than six times a year, 11 would develop breast cancer at some point in their lives, not taking into account other factors like genetic risk, weight and whether or not they smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while no amount of drinking is completely safe, you may be pleased to know that you can celebrate with a drink a few times a year and only increase your risk of breast cancer marginally, “though the general consensus is that anything more than zero does raise your risk,” says Dr Rumgay.&lt;/p&gt;

A canceled effort to develop a bird flu vaccine. An infectious new COVID variant and changing federal guidance about who should get boosted. In recent weeks, drama in D.C. has buried several vaccine-related developments. Todayâ€™s newsletter explains whatâ€™s new and what it means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;Last month, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926 "&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the CDC would no longer recommend that healthy children and healthy pregnant women receive COVID booster shots, altering Biden-era guidance that everyone older than 6 months get boosted annually. The CDC appeared to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;slightly soften Kennedyâ€™s guidance&lt;/a&gt;, saying that healthy kids and pregnant women â€œmayâ€� get boosters if their doctors recommend it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;The administration has tried to narrow the pool of people it says should get boosted. But where some of the changes reflect reasonable readings of the science, others do not.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. Nirav Shah, a top CDC official during the Biden administration, said experts debate whether younger children should get boosted. When Shah was in government, he recommended it. But many other countries donâ€™t, noting that most young children have a low risk of serious illness. The mRNA technology used in some COVID shots can also have side effects, including a condition called myocarditis that mostly affects boys and young men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But Shah, who previously led Maineâ€™s CDC and is now at Colby College, says the evidence is much less debatable in the case of pregnant women. Not only are boosters safe and effective for them, but getting them protects babies in utero and up to 6 months old &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/pregnancy-covid-vaccine-booster-safety-science-vs-rfk-jr-guidance/"&gt;who canâ€™t get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The way Kennedy made the changes has also troubled experts. Normally, health agencies gather outside advisersâ€™ input before making new recommendations. But Kennedy seems to have acted unilaterally. His announcement, made in a minutelong social media video, &lt;a href="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://wapo.st/4kmgCit"&gt;surprised CDC officials&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;). â€œWhat it suggests is that some of the conclusions are foregone,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy argues that health experts made mistakes that undermined public trust during the pandemic. Shah acknowledges that, to a point. Some experts, he said, tried to squelch dissenting views or didnâ€™t effectively communicate that scientistsâ€™ understanding of COVID would evolve, causing confusion when public health guidance changed. Other experts overstated &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nypost.com/2021/05/11/cdc-exaggerates-outdoor-transmission-rate-covid-19-experts/ "&gt;the risk of outdoor transmission&lt;/a&gt; or supported extended school closures that caused severe learning loss &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/upshot/pandemic-school-closures-data.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Mk8.RR9s.7SvgrzaRad7b&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;while doing little to contain infections&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;b&gt;ðŸŽ�&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the administrationâ€™s approach risks sowing further confusion. Kennedyâ€™s announcement conflicts with an article that two Trump-appointed FDA officials published days earlier, which listed pregnancy as one factor that puts women â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;at high risk for severe COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.â€� The fact that Kennedy â€” who has long spread vaccine misinformation and says he doesnâ€™t â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/27/nation/rfk-jr-hhs-first-100-days/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;think people should be taking medical advice from me&lt;/a&gt;â€� â€” made the changes could also corrode trust.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;â€œWhat worries me is that when we get into another emergency situation, if trust in federal health authorities has waned, thatâ€™s a problem,â€� Shah said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, COVID keeps evolving. A variant called NB.1.8.1 has recently driven up cases in China and elsewhere. But for now, Shah isnâ€™t hugely concerned. NB.1.8.1 descended from Omicron, a variant that swept the United States in late 2021 and early 2022. So even if cases rise, existing vaccines and antibodies from prior infection will likely help protect against severe illness. The World Health Organization says the new variant â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON572" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;suggests no increased public health risk&lt;/a&gt;â€� so far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;A few months ago, bird flu was spreading rapidly among cows and chickens, &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/29/metro/officials-say-widespread-bird-flu-outbreak-is-largest-state-has-seen/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;killing birds and other animals&lt;/a&gt;, and sickening dozens of people. Since then, the outbreak has slowed; the last reported human cases were in February, and only one person has died.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;Bird flu may be seasonal, which &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-cdc-8857e56c7b91d82613042beaba169a31" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;could explain the ebb&lt;/a&gt;. But another possibility is that cases are going unreported because fewer people are getting tested. In February, the administration &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/27/trump-fired-bird-flu-hires-00206334" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;fired, and then scrambled to rehire&lt;/a&gt;, officials involved in bird flu testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Given the uncertainty, some experts have faulted the administration for &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-administration-cancels-766-million-moderna-contract-fight-future-rcna209707"&gt;canceling contracts with Moderna&lt;/a&gt; to develop a bird flu vaccine. The effort aimed to adapt the companyâ€™s versatile mRNA technology, which Kennedy has repeatedly cast doubt on despite overwhelming evidence of safety. (The FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-moderna-covid-vaccine-rcna210250" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; a new mRNA COVID booster from Moderna last weekend.) Instead, the administration is funding a project aimed at developing a bird flu vaccine using technology &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/"&gt;similar to seasonal flu shots&lt;/a&gt;, which can take longer to produce.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatâ€™s changed: &lt;/b&gt;Cases of the highly contagious virus continue to rise nationwide, but slowly. The largest outbreak, in West Texas, seems to be abating. Three Americans have died this year, all unvaccinated.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What it means: &lt;/b&gt;A slowing case rate is good news, although many more people could have gotten sick than the official numbers reflect. The measles vaccine is safe, highly effective, and decades old, but Kennedy was slow to full-throatedly recommend it as the outbreak grew.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;ðŸ§© &lt;b&gt;3 Down:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9" title="https://bostonglobe.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90f9e490a860897c7155feca1&amp;amp;id=32a060d85a&amp;amp;e=6856f9c7b9"&gt;Repeat verbatim&lt;/a&gt; | â˜€ï¸� &lt;b&gt;90Â°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/06/04/metro/heat-humidity-and-hazy-skies-continue-across-boston-and-new-england/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;Hot, humid, and hazy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

            More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in the United States this year, and the highly contagious virus has put people at risk while they wait in ERs and doctor’s offices — but also at a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/shakira-measles-new-jersey-texas-mmr-25022a0b7c69a23c27b0ccdbf818ee86" target="_blank"&gt;Shakira concert&lt;/a&gt; in New Jersey, at a &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles060225.html" target="_blank"&gt;mall&lt;/a&gt; in Minnesota, at a &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/healthcare/2025/02/25/measles-outbreak-exposure-texas-new-braunfels-buc-ees/80309897007/" target="_blank"&gt;Buc-ee’s store in Texas&lt;/a&gt; and in airports and planes in several states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000a3b6m7lgg9e6s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,” the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/measles-globe" target="_blank"&gt;recently updated travel notice&lt;/a&gt;. “Infected travelers can bring the disease back to their home communities where it can spread rapidly among people who are not immune.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000b3b6mbyn4dfjo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a situation that may feel unfamiliar for US travelers. In 2000,&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region." target="_blank"&gt; measles was declared eliminated from the US&lt;/a&gt; due to highly effective and coordinated vaccination efforts. That year, only&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/measles-elimination-declaration-2000-texas-new-mexico-vaccines-mmr/" target="_blank"&gt; 85 cases&lt;/a&gt; were recorded, all of which were imported. But at least 1,157 measles cases have been reported this year, according to a CNN tally using data from state health departments. Only one other year since 2000 has had more cases: 2019, when there were 1,274.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiekfyp00083b6mv63s7rz3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vast majority of this year’s cases have been part of an ongoing multistate outbreak centered in West Texas. The outbreak appears to be stabilizing, but there is growing concern around the risk of additional spread due to summer travel, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieywbg000f3b6mm7vnvrpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the epicenter of the measles outbreak in Gaines County, “that community has either become immune by contracting measles and developing immunity from the disease, or in some cases, they’ve gotten vaccinated,” Freeman said, but she added that “there’s a cautionary tale,” because of summer travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiez6bs000h3b6majhmf2q5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Heavy travel is anticipated,” she warned. “The travel spread could continue throughout the rest of the country as these groups become mobile and still carry the disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000d3b6m7ffn9kth@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC’s health notice emphasizes that all international travelers should be fully vaccinated with the recommended two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and that infants ages 6 months to 11 months who are traveling should receive an extra dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000f3b6m2wc0jkqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, said this recommendation for infants was also given by the Texas Department of State Health Services in the 10 counties that have seen increased measles transmission during this year’s outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000g3b6m92llb34j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That means, then, that you’re going to wind up giving three doses instead of two doses. Usually, you give one dose [to children between] 12 to 15 months, a second dose at 4 to 6 years [old]. Now, you’re going to give three doses,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbievnpb000j3b6mwkrncz8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But he emphasized that that this extra dose is still safe: “The MMR vaccine is one of the safest vaccines we know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000h3b6mm162fea5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Neither the Texas health department nor the CDC recommends the MMR vaccine for adults born before 1957, Hotez notes, riding on the assumption that measles exposure was common in the first half of the 20th century and that exposure would have led to enduring immunity. However, there are exceptions for health care workers serving a measles outbreak area, for whom two MMR doses are recommended regardless of birth year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000i3b6m5d5437aw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hotez highlights that vaccine recommendations may change as outbreaks continue, stressing the importance of staying aware of updates from local health officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000j3b6m9psbirsq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The MMR vaccine is not recommended for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-pregnancy/moms-to-be/index.html#:~:text=Live%20virus%20vaccines%2C%20such%20as,also%20recommended%20for%20pregnant%20women." target="_blank"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, infants younger than 6 months and people who have severely weakened immune systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifcsml000j3b6m9s9999j3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the risk of exposure is generally low, people who can’t be vaccinated should speak with their doctor about their individual risk tolerance, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director for infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine. “A lot of this depends on their access to therapeutics at their travel destination, like are they going to an area where immunoglobulins may be available?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbifk29x000q3b6m9g9uc3po@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies, are naturally produced by the body as a part of immune responses. They play a crucial role in identifying and neutralizing foreign substances like bacteria and viruses and are specific to each pathogen. People who have a weakened immune system can get immunoglobulins, typically at a hospital or clinic, if they’re exposed to measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000m3b6mfv3kh7dt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, Roberts said, the most common source of US measles outbreaks has been non-immune US residents who traveled abroad, were exposed to the virus and then brought it back. Although some international travelers have brought measles into the US, this makes up a minority of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000l3b6mac87ej4q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although no country requires proof of MMR immunization for travel, Roberts advises travelers to “double-check their immunity status before traveling internationally.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidvax900003b6m9a1hxsdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This immunity may involve a prior measles infection, birth before 1957, lab test results of measles immunity or written documentation of MMR immunization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie5oxo00053b6mfxq26b20@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Travelers should check their status at least 6 weeks before they leave, he said. Full immunity includes the two doses of MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart as well as the two weeks it takes to build up final immunity after the last dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbiely3x000e3b6mywvyabk8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective against measles infection, so vaccinated travelers who suspect that they have been exposed to the virus shouldn’t need to worry, Roberts said. Although that leaves a 3% chance of infection, symptoms are significantly lessened with the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieyo4v000d3b6mw7n53f9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are unvaccinated and suspect that you may have been exposed, Roberts says you should see a doctor as soon as possible. “Depending on how soon you are after exposure, you can still do something,” he said. You may be able to get immunoglobulin or even the MMR vaccine to help lessen symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbie8r1m00073b6mjmih0k3q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other than verifying immunity, Roberts advises typical &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/page/pack-smart" target="_blank"&gt;travel guidance&lt;/a&gt; such as packing commonly used and prescribed medications, as well as keeping a list of hospitals or clinics at your destination and other first-aid supplies. When traveling internationally, Roberts recommends checking the &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list" target="_blank"&gt;country-specific travel health notices&lt;/a&gt; on the CDC website to stay aware of additional vaccinations and medications needed for certain destinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000n3b6m3a5cbal1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Roberts advises travelers wash their hands frequently, avoid people who are sick when possible, stay in well-ventilated areas and wear masks if they are at high risk of severe illness, staying up to date with vaccinations, especially those who were unable to get vaccinated because of severe immunodeficiency. These practices don’t just help prevent measles infection, they help curb infection from other circulating pathogens such as Covid-19 and the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000o3b6m6lpffj8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is one of the most contagious germs around. In one case 10 years ago, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5779523/" target="_blank"&gt;four travelers were infected by a person at the same airport gate&lt;/a&gt;. “This highlights how contagious [measles] is,” Roberts said. “Even airports and terminals are risky.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbidbjnb000p3b6msvvvf0xh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ongoing measles outbreak is not to be taken lightly, Hotez said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbieck5q00093b6mr84yusx9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the 1980s, measles was the single leading killer of children globally. It [led to] 3 million deaths annually. Now, through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance and other programs, we’ve brought it down to around 100,000 deaths, but it’s still a lot. And we’re seeing what happens in West Texas. Ten percent, 20% of kids are being hospitalized, measles, pneumonia, neurologic injury. We’ve had over 90 hospitalizations so far in Texas and two measles deaths.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

After checking in, I was taken to a room and handed a paper sheet to drape over myself. A full-body exam is definitely full-body. The doctor checks everything from your scalp to the bottoms of your feet. But it was quick, professional and surprisingly not awkward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://georgiaskinspecialists.com/providers/corinne-erickson/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Corinne Erickson&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Georgia Skin Specialists, immediately put me at ease. She grew up in Macon and is one of the only dermatologists in Georgia with an integrative dermatology certification. This means she takes a whole-body approach to skin health, focusing on both external symptoms and internal triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="9"&gt;“We’re very skin cancer exam-oriented here,” she said, holding up two dermatoscopes — small, high-powered tools used to magnify and illuminate skin lesions. “Nothing escapes my eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-subscription__placeholder subscription-promo b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-component  b-margin-bottom-d40-m20  image-portrait" data-index="11"&gt;&lt;div class="image-component-image inline "&gt;&lt;div class="enlargeImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: CatMax Photography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="[object%20Object]" class="image-expand" alt="icon to expand image"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="photo-credit-text"&gt;Credit: CatMax Photography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-nativo_placeholder--moap b-clear-both "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;What ‘derms’ are looking for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="15"&gt;As she examined my skin, Erickson assessed each mole using the &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/find/at-risk/abcdes" target="_blank"&gt;ABCDE method&lt;/a&gt; — a checklist dermatologists use to spot early signs of melanoma. It stands for asymmetry, border, color, diameter and evolution. Basically, anything that’s oddly shaped, unevenly colored, larger than a pencil eraser or changing over time could raise a red flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="16"&gt;The mole I’ve silently obsessed over for years? Totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="17"&gt;“Melanoma typically presents as a new collection of abnormal pigment cells on the skin,” Erickson explained. “Sure, an old mole you have can become cancerous, but more commonly, melanoma is a new dark spot of cancerous melanocytes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="18"&gt;She also emphasized that skin cancer doesn’t just affect people who’ve spent years tanning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="19"&gt;“Most melanoma, squamous cell and basal cell — I mean they’re from the sun,” she said. “But there is a subset of melanoma that’s not related to sun. The type that can grow on the feet, for example, or under the nails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="RP09 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="22"&gt;So, when should you start getting checked?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="23"&gt;“Yearly, not really based on age. It changes based on what your skin does,” she said. “If someone comes in and every time we’re removing abnormal moles … we may recommend every six months." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="24"&gt;Because of my history of blistering sunburns as a teen, I’ll be returning annually. This schedule, according to Erickson, is recommended for most people with fair skin, a family history of skin cancer or a lot of moles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;What Erickson found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="27"&gt;First, the dot on my eyelid: not a sty, not skin cancer, but a common &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22786-cherry-angioma" target="_blank"&gt;cherry angioma&lt;/a&gt;, which is a tiny cluster of blood vessels. “These come and stay,” Erickson said. “Totally harmless.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="28"&gt;Next, she zeroed in on my cheeks. Redness, bumps, dryness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="PX01 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="30"&gt;“Have you ever been told &lt;a href="https://georgiaskinspecialists.com/medical-dermatology/rosacea/" target="_blank"&gt;you have rosacea&lt;/a&gt; before?” she asked. I told her yes — once, during a questionable online consultation — but I’d always doubted the diagnosis. “Well,” she said gently, “I do think you have it. And we can treat it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="31"&gt;She prescribed a topical cream and laid out a simple skin care plan. I’m to start using SPF 50 every morning, a hydrating moisturizer (like the First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream I already use), and keeping an eye on common rosacea triggers, including spicy foods, cinnamon, tomatoes, citrus and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;The 411 on skin care in the sun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="33"&gt;Erickson also gave me a crash course in SPF science, which is something every Georgia resident should probably get, including these simple tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="list b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use more SPF than you think you need:&lt;/b&gt; If you use the correct amount, a typical bottle should last just six full-body applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go mineral when you can:&lt;/b&gt; Zinc and titanium-based sunscreens are gentler on sensitive skin and for babies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clothing is key:&lt;/b&gt; A rash guard or UPF shirt is more reliable than reapplying sunscreen after every swim.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="35"&gt;She also emphasized why patients need to supplement with vitamin D — especially those wearing sunscreen daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP03 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="37"&gt;“It’s technically a hormone, not a vitamin,” Erickson said. “It supports everything from bone health to immune function — even hair growth. And since I’m telling everybody to wear sunscreen, I’m also telling everybody to make sure they’re taking their vitamin D.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-heading b-margin-bottom-d40-m20"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="41"&gt;I walked in fearing the unknown. I walked out feeling more in control of my skin than I ever have. It was quick, painless and surprisingly empowering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="42"&gt;“The most important step,” Erickson told me, “is just getting in the door. It’s always scarier in your head.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="story-text " data-index="43"&gt;Although my skin concerns turned out to be manageable — and I left the appointment cancer-free — the visit was a good reminder of why these checks matter. Even if you don’t have a glaring issue, a quick scan could catch something serious before it becomes dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="HP04 arc_ad b-margin-bottom-d30-m20 "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AJC.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:54:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNenlPWWF1aVdKbXRVYTktc2JyZkdNU2ppVXl2am1WSzNzdE1xNVFLTTRsWHVCS2c5Ti1vbFFNUGNQenh6V2JuRGNIZVdhcTB3NXE0MUZFa2hoUE56ZFZUdXd2aGVwSXppUXc4U3oza0RpLVp1dVVucy1UemRhQlFNMUxpM1FsZV9nbVQ1TjdwRGdYckRORnE3S2FQbHJYMWZf</guid></item><item><title>肾脏科医生分享了一些迹象，以了解您的肾脏是否不健康： “体重减轻和对肿胀的胃口不佳……” -《印度斯坦时报》 | Nephrologist shares signs to know if your kidneys are not healthy: 'Weight loss and poor appetite to swelling in…' - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/nephrologist-shares-signs-to-know-if-your-kidneys-are-not-healthy-weight-loss-and-poor-appetite-to-swelling-101749117190225.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.theisn.org/more-than-850-million-worldwide-have-some-form-of-kidney-disease-help-raise-awareness/" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="International Society of Nephrology"&gt;International Society of Nephrology&lt;/a&gt;, more than 850 million worldwide have some form of kidney disease.

Kidney disease is often diagnosed incidentally during routine blood or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/urologist-reveals-the-one-trick-to-check-your-kidney-health-without-any-test-101748933204888.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="urine tests"&gt;urine tests&lt;/a&gt; for other conditions. Kidney damage may not show symptoms until function is significantly impaired, making early detection vital. Often, symptoms remain vague and nonspecific until the later stages of kidney disease,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/13/original/shutterstock_2215941219_1741857847657.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Kidney disease is often diagnosed incidentally during routine blood or urine tests for other conditions.

Even at advanced stages, symptoms can remain vague and nonspecific,” he added. Common signs include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Weight loss and poor appetite&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Swelling in the ankles, feet, or hands due to fluid retention&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Shortness of breath&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Fatigue&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Blood in the urine&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Increased frequency of urination, especially at night&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Itchy skin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Muscle cramps&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Nausea&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;• Headaches&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why is kidney health important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stressing on the importance of keeping our kidneys healthy, Dr Nishchay said, “Kidneys play a crucial role not only in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood but also in regulating blood pressure, maintaining electrolyte balance, and producing hormones essential for red blood cell production.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

As men lose weight, their penises appear larger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One unidentified male who has been using Ozempic has explained how he noticed a difference down there after taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Taking to &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.unilad.com/reddit"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, the man penned: "I recently measured myself down there and noticed I gained about 1 inch.
