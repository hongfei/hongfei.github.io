On a cloudy November day in 2022, her mother, Julie Newman, was about to complete her final round of radiation, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in September. The whole family, a close-knit bunch, was gathering with balloons and signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Freed, then a few weeks shy of her 31st birthday, was carrying a secret. Spurred by her mother’s diagnosis, she had her first mammogram a couple days earlier, and it had turned up a suspicious spot. Now she needed a second, diagnostic mammogram, and likely a biopsy. She found herself walking a surreal sort of tightrope, caught between relief that her mother’s treatment was over and fear that she might soon be starting her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I went to the radiation center that morning, celebrated my mom having her last radiation treatment, had breakfast with everyone,” she recalls. “And then quietly went back to the medical campus, to the building across the street, to have my next set of scans and imagery done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Two weeks later, on 9 December 2022, Freed learned she had an early form of breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Telling her mom, she says, was excruciating: “I just remember being like, I don’t want to give her this news, but I also cannot keep this from her.” Just three months out from her own diagnosis, Newman, now 68, was shocked. “It was like a kick in the stomach,” she says. “I couldn’t believe it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-double-diagnoses-can-affect-families" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How double diagnoses can affect families&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Newman pivoted from patient to caregiver, helping Freed’s husband with the couple’s two-year-old daughter while Freed recovered from her double mastectomy. Then Newman learned she needed a second lumpectomy, and Freed checked on her frequently; Newman set up a meal train for Freed from her recovery chair. It was a relentless rush of role-switching, says Freed, based on who was feeling better that day: “It felt like we were living through hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Back-to-back cancer diagnoses can have a profound psychological impact, unearthing sadness, helplessness and fear, says Dr Neha Goyal, a clinical psychologist at the University of California at San Francisco’s Helen Diller Family Comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="541680a8-0296-4b43-9f11-2094bb4ee26e" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Julie Newman and her daughter, Genna Newman Freed, at Julie’s home in Findlay, Ohio, on 17 November.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Amy Lynn Powell/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When someone – let alone two members of the same family – is navigating a cancer diagnosis, “there’s such a sense of loss of control”, she says. The people rallying around them may grapple with their own anxiety, grief and exhaustion. “It affected the whole family,” agrees Newman. “It was a very trying time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="feeling-powerless-to-protect" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feeling powerless to protect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Last January, three weeks into recovery from her own double mastectomy, Janet Parks, 62, found out that her 36-year-old daughter had breast cancer. “That was harder than my own diagnosis,” she says. “As a mother, your job is to protect your child at all costs, and I couldn’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/facts-statistics" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;majority &lt;/a&gt;of breast cancers occur in women with no family history, “we know that women who have breast cancer in their family have an elevated risk”, says Dr Nan Chen, a breast medical oncologist at the University of Chicago. In fact, having a first-degree relative like a mother, daughter or sister who develops breast cancer &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/risk-and-prevention/breast-cancer-risk-factors-you-cannot-change.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;almost doubles&lt;/a&gt; your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-ovarian-cancer-hereditary/causes/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;5% to 10%&lt;/a&gt; of breast cancers are totally hereditary in that they result directly from a mutated gene – like &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet#what-are-brca1-and-brca2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;BRCA1, BRCA2&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/other-breast-cancer-gene-mutations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; – passed down from parent to child, says Chen. About &lt;a href="https://youngandstrong.dana-farber.org/genetics.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;15% to 20%&lt;/a&gt; are considered “familial”, she says, meaning that while no specific gene mutation has been identified, there is still a family link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="547cc3fa-4a7e-4d90-866a-f08e0dbf98dc" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Janet Parks and her daughter, Alicia Schlossberg. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A woman with a BRCA mutation faces &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/brca1-and-brca2-mutations" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a 45% to 85% risk &lt;/a&gt;of developing breast cancer by age 70, compared with the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;average lifetime risk&lt;/a&gt; of about 13%. Parks’s daughter, Alicia Schlossberg, inherited the BRCA-2 mutation from her mother; her chance of passing it down to her own daughters, aged 2 and 5, is &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/risk-assessment-screening/genetic-counseling-and-testing/hereditary-cancer-genes-and-hereditary-cancer-syndromes/brca1-and-brca2-genes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;50%&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m obviously very nervous that this is going to be their reality someday,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Freed too is concerned about her daughter’s future. She inherited a BRCA-2 mutation from her father’s side, and wants to give her five-year-old daughter the choice to be tested for it when she’s older. The weight of the genetic gamble keeps her up at night, she says: “Am I borrowing all of this worry from tomorrow for nothing?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="same-diagnosis-different-experiences" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Same diagnosis, different experiences&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The median age of diagnosis is 62, but breast cancer rates in younger women are &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-young-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;steadily rising&lt;/a&gt;; about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bring-your-brave/breast-cancer-in-young-women/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/young_women/bringyourbrave/breast_cancer_young_women/index.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;10%&lt;/a&gt; of new breast cancer cases in the United States occur in women under the age of 45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Younger women &lt;a href="https://www.bcrf.org/about-breast-cancer/breast-cancer-young-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tend to be diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; when their breast cancer has progressed to a later stage, and with more aggressive subtypes that require chemotherapy. But beyond the practical disparities, getting breast cancer in your 30s versus your 60s is “emotionally and psychosocially a completely different experience”, Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lindsey Baker was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer in December 2020 at the age of 35. The week of Baker’s double mastectomy in 2021, her mother, Shelley Pozez, learned she had breast cancer, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It felt like a similar experience, but on a very different path,” says Baker. She was single, lived alone and dreaded the intricacies of dating after cancer treatment; her mother had a supportive long-term partner. Pozez, then 66, already had children; Baker – who inherited the BRCA-1 mutation, which also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5527889/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;raises the risk&lt;/a&gt; of ovarian cancer, from her father’s side – made the tough decision to remove her ovaries, surrendering her fertility and plunging prematurely into menopause. Pozez was retired at diagnosis; Baker, who was the chief operating officer of two non-profits, worked throughout treatment, bringing her laptop to all 16 rounds of chemo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="134bcefa-a79a-4777-b9e0-ef11f61edb88" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Lindsey Baker and Shelley Pozez in August 2025 at a family reunion in Atlanta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Risk of recurrence is nuanced and depends on various factors. But Baker’s cancer, caught later than Pozez’s, was also growing more aggressively. “I think the chances of mine coming back are higher,” she says. “That still weighs on me differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Baker and Pozez diverged when it came to discussing what they were going through, too. While Baker drew solace from hearing other women’s experiences and sharing her own, her mom “was just a lot more private about it”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Similarly, Freed is more candid about her cancer journey than her mother. After her mastectomy, she opted for a form of breast reconstruction called &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/going-flat-no-reconstruction/aesthetic-flat-closure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aesthetic flat closure&lt;/a&gt;. “If somebody’s like: ‘Hey, what does a flat closure look like?’, I’m like: ‘Do you want me to take off my shirt?’” she says. “If my mom were in that boat, she’d be like: ‘You want me to do what now?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sylvia Morrison, 61, handled her breast cancer diagnosis in 2011 the way she’d seen her mother handle one several years before. “She didn’t really talk about it,” she says. “She showed no fear, no concern.” It was only when Morrison’s daughter, Monisha Parker, was diagnosed three years later at age 28 that she recognized that there might be another way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1ad4ad96-f415-47a6-9fe0-23b817514dad" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--inline element-inline dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Monisha Parker and her mother, Sylvia Morrison.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I was a lot more open and willing to share my story,” says Parker, who started a blog, &lt;a href="https://purposepaintedpink.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Purpose Painted Pink&lt;/a&gt;, about her experience as a young cancer patient. “I definitely think it’s a generational thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morrison, whose cancer recurred in 2019, has regrets about her prior stoicism. “I’m still dealing with the mental part of breast cancer,” she says. “I’m over the physical part of it, but the mental part of it I didn’t deal with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Watching her daughter’s response to cancer has encouraged Morrison to voice her emotions more often, in all aspects of life: “Monisha dealt with both sides of it, which I applaud her for, because she did something I didn’t do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-benefits-of-mutual-support" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of mutual support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Morrison worried, would her cancer experience scare her daughter? “But I think it had the opposite effect,” she says. “Once she got over the initial shock, she was able to draw strength because I went through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the spring of 2022, Allison Mertzman, now 40, was recovering from chemo and undergoing radiation for breast cancer, when she learned that her mother, Susan Pearlman, now 66, had the disease, too. “I was in such survival mode at that point that I was like: ‘Alright, hop on my boat, we’ve got to survive this together,’” she says. “We almost became teammates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Already close, the two traded advice, words of encouragement and even post-mastectomy garments. Now that they’re both cancer-free, Pearlman says, she worries every time Mertzman goes in for a scan. “But I also know what that’s like. I feel the same thing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="6cdd7503-34a3-4bf0-af1e-4a1fa9486d8e" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="element element--supporting element-supporting dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Allison Mertzman and her mom, Susan Pearlman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Weathering a life-changing illness alongside a loved one can often be “a source of even stronger connection”, says Goyal. At the same time, she cautions, it can also further any existing schism. “It doesn’t take away any underlying issues that may be present, and in fact can amplify them,” she says. “It depends on the dynamic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="balancing-grief-and-gratitude" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing grief and gratitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Freed, facing diagnosis, treatment and survivorship alongside her mother has yielded conflicting emotions. She’s grateful that her cancer was caught early, and that she and Newman are both still here. But she grieves all the losses: her breasts, time with her daughter and a sense of normalcy she’ll never entirely get back. “It’s two very diverging feelings,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Parks too understands this dichotomy; after all, her diagnosis was devastating, but it also prompted her daughter to visit an oncologist and schedule an MRI, which detected cancer that likely wouldn’t have been seen on an ultrasound or mammogram until much later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I see it as a blessing, honestly,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For Schlossberg, it’s bittersweet that something monstrous had to happen to her mother for something miraculous to happen to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I hate that my mom had to go through this, and I hate that we even see her cancer that way,” she says. “But it really did save my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 17:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQanN4V0NBSEhNS3NsSk51UVBzcGgydG5qeHBsZ0wwS2N2clpxQWNuTF84UW9kY0Uwa0RVUTFFNWNwczIxT1FiSmpqV2tPVGtrT1N4SUZpV2xhVVhEM0ZHQ19fVUR2MFNibS0yZVMzbWRZSnVYWmo5RFZBeGFZbGZSY3Y1ZDB4eG9oVGg1ZkFrZlFBeTRfWjJEYw</guid></item><item><title>纽约人如何避免在这个假日季节感染流感（和FOMO ） - Gothamist</title><link>https://gothamist.com/news/how-new-yorkers-can-avoid-catching-the-flu-and-fomo-this-holiday-season</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="streamfield-paragraph rte-text"&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9gxv4"&gt;There’s nothing quite like the flu season to put a damper on the holiday party season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7n10e"&gt;As flu cases &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/flu-season-arrives-in-ny-with-major-spike-in-cases" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;continue to rise&lt;/a&gt; in New York, the city health department has launched a new campaign that plays on the endemic condition of FOMO, or fear of missing out, to get New Yorkers to take extra precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dlq75"&gt;The $1 million “Don’t Miss Out” campaign urges New Yorkers to get vaccinated and to take other steps to avoid spreading the flu and other respiratory illnesses. That includes being extra vigilant about hand-washing, wearing masks, covering up when coughing or sneezing, and keeping surfaces clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3r04i"&gt;“Less sick time.

He also said it’s a generally good idea to wear a mask when respiratory viruses are going around, but especially if you have symptoms yourself — even if you’re not sure yet whether it’s the flu, a cold, RSV or COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 data-block-key="33rfv"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oh, there’s always the doctor, masks and hand-washing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="90p74"&gt;Camins suggested going to the doctor — ideally, with a mask on — to get diagnosed within 48 hours of getting sick. Those who test positive for the flu can then get a prescription for an antiviral flu medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9uqk4"&gt;He added that over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen can also help reduce fever and body aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="d9oet"&gt;Camins acknowledged that staying healthy can be hard if someone else in the household gets sick, especially since those living in cramped NYC apartments may not be able to avoid sharing a bathroom. But Camins said frequent hand-washing — especially if you’re the caretaker — is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOd1FSSDNHLWNXMlNEczZHWmh4Z1lDcnN3ZHlUOENGb0JBVGppbGNadW45LWJIU1lQVlRNZTBlY2I0WGJGZ1pWdUppMEZrNTNoamNGZ2lwYy0weGRwdnBpYmlVT1QybkxTRGdNY1NGZE9DZVFHUVFRQnpmeGJpb2kyQ2lwUkFoRHBZejlydEhiR2VkbTZBU3pCbHNycnVNd1U</guid></item><item><title>为什么切黄油和奶酪对数百万人来说可能毫无意义-《独立报》</title><link>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/saturated-fat-butter-cheese-health-b2885607.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gIQPHK sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iBibVd"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 jVZWGn"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eZqxmv"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 tawua"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 gZmYS"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 iCTyfe"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Heavy consumption has traditionally been viewed as one of the leading contributors to poor cardiovascular health, cementing saturated fats as a key target in public health campaigns and nutritional guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging that “a small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet,” the NHS advises that men should not eat more than 30g of saturated fats a day, and women no more than 20g, with the less consumed the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a major meta-analysis of 17 studies, involving a total of 66,337 participants, into how reductions of saturated fats affect health outcomes, found only “high risk” individuals benefitted from reduced consumption of these foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For persons at low cardiovascular risk, reducing or modifying saturated fat intake has little or no benefit over a period of 5 years,” the research team, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-02229"&gt;&lt;u&gt;writing in medical journal the &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they added: “Among persons at high cardiovascular risk, low- to moderate-certainty evidence was found for important reductions in mortality and major cardiovascular events.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an editorial published alongside the research, Dr Ramon Estruch, and Dr Rosa Lamuela-Raventós, both of the University of Barcelona, suggested that the dial of perception on saturated fats has shifted from being wholly negative, to now even having previously under-appreciated health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Times They Are A-Changin,” &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04971"&gt;&lt;u&gt;they wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, quoting Bob Dylan, before clarifying that they specifically mean regarding the changing debate on consumption of saturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The perception of the health effects of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) has shifted from strictly detrimental to ‘in-between’ effects, to more recently, possibly even protective effects on cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases for some subtypes of SFAs,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that the “diet-heart hypothesis” behind the concerns about saturated fat consumption emerged in the mid-20th century, and rapidly gained traction, “and spread the concept that SFAs cause heart disease by increasing serum cholesterol level”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue the hypothesis is “based on weak evidence of association and not causation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bHmhpR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/08/12/46/iStock-1478037416.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/08/12/46/iStock-1478037416.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/08/12/46/iStock-1478037416.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="A beautiful slab of cheese – probably ok if taken as part of a balanced diet" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-163721"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;A beautiful slab of cheese – probably ok if taken as part of a balanced diet&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, maintaining a high intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids, along with the consumption of short-, medium-, and very long-chain SFAs, as well as odd-chain SFAs, may confer salutary benefits within the context of an overall healthy and balanced diet,” they concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/food-types/different-fats-nutrition/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;current NHS advice states&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “Too much fat in your diet, especially saturated fats, can raise your cholesterol, which increases the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Current UK government guidelines advise cutting down on all fats and replacing saturated fat with some unsaturated fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, experts have sounded a note of caution. Professor Nita Forouhi, a population health and nutrition expert at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the study, said the analysis did not examine health outcomes over ten years – the timeframe typically used in heart-disease risk models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For this reason, it would be premature to change existing dietary guidelines recommending saturated fat intake below 10 per cent of total energy intake in the UK,” she told the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxORHJIaDdNTUtqaUZlRnFia0dxY2dfVnB1V0p6WERxQ1FnTFZFSlZjaHdjSG1TcElpcHRCTE9USHNtSWZrSFhiRkZEWVVCM1RHM0hOLVJIUERKbFBVZHdERldUcTZPX2RxQjhuT0FsWHllVlhsbUNNWWNwWVN2cTN3bUR2VDF1bUlycGxEcUFzei1CMkhS</guid></item><item><title>可可博士的巧克力对乙酰氨基酚是您新的流感季节技巧-今日美国</title><link>https://www.usatoday.com/story/shopping/2025/12/15/dr-cocoa-childrens-acetaminophen-amazon-deal/87764646007/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_dt"&gt;Dec. 15, 2025&lt;span class="gnt_ar_ut"&gt;Updated Dec. 16, 2025, 9:12 a.m. ET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;ul class="gnt_sh"&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;A new chocolate-flavored children's acetaminophen from Dr. Cocoa is set to launch on December 15, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;The product is a pain reliever and fever reducer designed to be more palatable for children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="gnt_sh_li"&gt;A limited-time 15% discount is available on select Dr. Cocoa products at Amazon through January 4, 2026.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If you’ve ever had to beg, bribe or chase your child around the house with a medicine spoon, you know the struggles that can come with flu season. &lt;a href="https://go.linkby.com/SAZRTPPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dr. Cocoa&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier by combining safe, effective relief with a new kid-approved taste.

"In fact, Christmas Eve is the highest-risk day of the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is due to a shift in behavior, specifically drinking and eating too much, moving less and being &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stressed out;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stressed out&lt;/a&gt;, according to London.

"Adding travel, stress and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and it lowers the threshold to go into that rhythm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest risk related to atrial fibrillation, according to Hirsch, is stroke and other complications from blood clots. Untreated atrial fibrillation can lead to heart failure after a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/want-better-heart-health-start-tackling-your-weakest-link-cardiac-surgeon-says" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Want Better Heart Health?

Over many decades, some bacteria have gradually become resistant to widely used antibiotics and disinfectants, creating serious challenges for medicine and public health. At the same time, countless bacterial species play a helpful and often critical role in keeping the human body healthy. This raises an important question. Instead of trying to eliminate bacteria, could scientists find ways to influence how they behave to reduce disease and improve health?&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria are far from silent. Inside the human mouth, roughly 700 different bacterial species constantly exchange information through a process called quorum sensing. This chemical communication allows bacteria to coordinate their actions as a group. Many oral bacteria rely on signaling molecules known as N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) to send and receive these messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating Bacterial Communication in Dental Plaque&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities College of Biological Sciences and the School of Dentistry set out to explore how bacteria in the mouth communicate and whether that communication could be deliberately disrupted. Their goal was to determine if interfering with these signals could help prevent plaque buildup and support a healthier oral microbiome. The findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;npj Biofilms and Microbiomes&lt;/em&gt;, suggest this approach could reshape how doctors think about treating bacterial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings From the Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered several important patterns in how oral bacteria communicate and organize themselves:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Bacteria in dental plaque generate AHL signals in oxygen-rich areas (such as above the gumline), and those signals can be detected by bacteria living in oxygen-poor regions (beneath the gumline).&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Eliminating AHL signals using specialized enzymes called lactonases led to an increase in bacterial species associated with good oral health.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;These results indicate that carefully chosen enzymes might be used to reshape dental plaque communities and help maintain a healthy balance of microbes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dental Plaque as a Living Ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Dental plaque develops in a sequence, much like a forest ecosystem," said Mikael Elias, associate professor in the College of Biological Sciences and senior author of the study. "Pioneer species like Streptococcus and Actinomyces are the initial settlers in simple communities -- they're generally harmless and associated with good oral health. Increasingly diverse late colonizers include the 'red complex' bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, which are strongly linked to periodontal disease. By disrupting the chemical signals bacteria use to communicate, one could manipulate the plaque community to remain or return to its health-associated stage."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What's particularly striking is how oxygen availability changes everything," said lead author Rakesh Sikdar. "When we blocked AHL signaling in aerobic conditions, we saw more health-associated bacteria. But when we added AHLs under anaerobic conditions, we promoted the growth of disease-associated late colonizers. Quorum sensing may play very different roles above and below the gumline, which has major implications for how we approach treatment of periodontal diseases."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward New Microbiome-Based Treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers plan to next examine how bacterial signaling differs across various regions of the mouth and among patients at different stages of periodontal disease. "Understanding how bacterial communities communicate and organize themselves may ultimately give us new tools to prevent periodontal disease -- not by waging war on all oral bacteria, but by strategically maintaining a healthy microbial balance," said Elias. The team believes this strategy could eventually lead to therapies for other parts of the body, where imbalances in the microbiome are linked to illness and certain forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the research was provided by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The morning habit that can spike your cholesterol levels over time is skipping breakfast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It can throw off your circadian rhythm, decrease your diet quality and cause overeating.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go for a breakfast high in fiber and protein, move your body and minimize stress daily.   &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You might think your mornings are healthy—but certain daily rituals could quietly raise your cholesterol over time. We interviewed heart health experts to reveal the surprising morning habit that can affect your heart, plus simple swaps to protect it. Turns out, it’s something about 15% of US adults do on any given day!&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We’re talking about skipping breakfast. Studies consistently show that skipping breakfast is linked with higher cholesterol levels, even when it leads to modest weight loss.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; There are a few reasons for this, which we’re diving into below.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Throws Off Your Circadian Rhythm &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Skipping breakfast can throw off your circadian rhythm—your body’s internal clock.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;One of the many things that your circadian rhythm controls is lipid metabolism. When your body’s internal clock is thrown off, it may alter some genes and enzymes that regulate your cholesterol.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Without that morning meal, the liver’s HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, which controls the rate of cholesterol production, becomes more active, producing more LDL and total cholesterol,” says &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD, CDCES, CDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating breakfast, on the other hand, can help prevent cholesterol spikes that typically happen when you wake up. “Normally, cholesterol synthesis peaks in the early morning, but eating breakfast provides nutrients that help buffer this process,” says Routhenstein.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; You May Overeat Later &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you find yourself mindlessly snacking on high-carb or high-fat foods throughout the day, skipping breakfast may be the underlying cause. “Skipping breakfast can trigger metabolic shifts that increase cholesterol production and may also cause overeating later in the day,” says cardiologist, &lt;a href="https://manhattancardiology.com/team/dr-randy-gould/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dr. Randy Gould&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is in part because of shifts in hormones that regulate appetite. “Prolonged morning fasting can alter hormones like leptin and ghrelin, increasing hunger and promoting insulin resistance,” says Routhenstein. “This combination can impair your body’s ability to clear cholesterol from the blood, further contributing to higher LDL cholesterol,” she adds. Your body experiences rebound hunger because its nutrient needs were not met earlier in the day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, research results are mixed as to whether skipping breakfast actually leads you to eat more throughout the day. Some studies have found that skipping breakfast leads to a lower overall calorie intake.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, studies consistently find worse cholesterol levels in people who skip breakfast, whether or not they eat more calories throughout the day.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Your Overall Diet Quality May Suffer &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Delaying your first meal of the day may also affect the overall quality of your diet. “Skipping breakfast often leads to larger, less nutrient-dense meals later in the day,” says Routhenstein. These meals may be higher in saturated fat and refined carbs, which “directly contribute to more LDL particle formation and reduce the protective effects of HDL cholesterol,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One study found that kids who skip breakfast tend to eat more fat and sodium throughout the day than kids who eat breakfast.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is notable because eating excess saturated fat and sodium can harm heart health. Plus, skipping breakfast may make it harder to eat enough whole grains—sources of high-quality carbs, fiber and minerals—particularly in the U.S. where whole grain cereals are common breakfast foods.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another study found that Australian adults who ate a big breakfast consumed more fiber, vitamins and minerals throughout the day than those who skipped it. They also consumed less added sugars, saturated fats and alcohol, which can all negatively affect heart health.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides eating breakfast, there are a few things you can do to transform your morning routine into a tool to lower your cholesterol. The best part? They can be done in a relatively short amount of time! If you currently wake up and rush out the door with no self-care time, focus on adding one thing at a time instead of overhauling your morning routine overnight.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay screen time. &lt;/strong&gt;If you reach for your phone first thing in the morning, try to delay this as much as you can. It may seem unrelated to heart health, but Routhenstein notes how checking messages, notifications or the news can increase stress and start your day on a negative foot. “Taking 10 to 30 minutes screen-free to start your day helps reduce stress, improves mood and allows you to take control of your day and prioritize your health,” says Routhenstein.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat a balanced breakfast. &lt;/strong&gt;Now you know that eating breakfast is important for heart health, but &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you eat also matters.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Experts recommend heart-healthy foods rich in fiber and low in added sugars and saturated fat. “Starting the day with a balanced breakfast—such as oatmeal, whole grains, lean protein and fresh fruit—helps stabilize energy and avoid the cholesterol-raising effects of sugary cereals and drinks,” says Dr. Gould. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get in some movement.&lt;/strong&gt; “A brief period of movement, whether a brisk walk, stretching or light strength training, can improve circulation and support healthy cholesterol levels,” says Dr. Gould. In fact, physical activity is recommended as a first-line approach to managing high cholesterol.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So go for a morning stroll, hit the gym or get in a quick stretch when you wake up. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take time to destress.&lt;/strong&gt; Diet and exercise aren’t the only things that influence heart health—stress also plays a big role. “Stress triggers the release of cortisol, a hormone that can raise cholesterol production, and it may also lead to unhealthy coping habits like overeating,” says Dr. Gould. Especially if you live a high-stress lifestyle, take a few minutes (or more!) in the morning to destress, whether through movement, breathwork, journaling or anything else that works for you! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As tempting as it may be to rush out the door without eating a balanced breakfast, this habit could silently raise your cholesterol. Heart health experts recommend eating a high-fiber, high-protein morning meal that’s low in added sugars and saturated fat. This helps stabilize your energy levels, buffer the liver’s production of cholesterol and prevent overeating later in the day. In addition to eating a nutritious breakfast, try to take time to move and destress at the start of your day instead of checking your phone to prevent cholesterol-raising cortisol spikes.

			&lt;p&gt;Tiny biological batteries &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-cells-powerhouses-are-secretly-helping-fight-bacteria-study-finds"&gt;known as mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; keep the body's cells running smoothly, and their gradual decline is linked to a wide range of age-related diseases. Now scientists think they have found a way to keep mitochondria powered for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A protein called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COX7A2L"&gt;COX7RP&lt;/a&gt; is key to this discovery from researchers at the Saitama Medical University and Chiba University in Japan. The protein is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-12124-6"&gt;thought&lt;/a&gt; to help mitochondria form &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomplex"&gt;supercomplexes&lt;/a&gt;, structures that improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, male mice engineered to produce extra COX7RP showed a host of differences compared with controls, including a 6.6 percent increase in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lifespan-is-shaped-more-by-your-choices-than-your-genes-study-finds"&gt;average lifespan&lt;/a&gt; and indicators of an extended healthspan – being able to live healthier for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mitochondria-dump-their-rubbish-dna-and-it-could-be-costing-us-our-health"&gt;Mitochondria Dump Their Rubbish DNA, And It Could Be Costing Us Our Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We previously identified COX7RP, a mitochondrial protein, as a key factor that promotes the formation of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes, thereby enhancing energy production and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause oxidative stress in cells," &lt;a href="https://www.tmghig.jp/research/en/etopics/archives/016907/index.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; gerontologist Satoshi Inoue, from Saitama Medical University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on this, we investigated the role of COX7RP and mitochondrial respiratory supercomplexes in regulating aging and anti-aging processes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185334" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/LifespanChart.jpg" alt="Mice lifespan" class="wp-image-185334 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/LifespanChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/LifespanChart-600x297.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185334" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Genetically engineered mice were shown to live longer. (Ikeda et al., &lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The improved healthspan indicators observed in the COX7RP-boosted mice included better glucose handling, lower levels of fatty acids in the blood, and increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;muscle endurance&lt;/a&gt;, which can all help maintain functional bodies into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of mouse tissue samples confirmed that the mitochondria in the COX7RP-boosted mice were operating more efficiently – linked to more supercomplexes – and producing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-your-body-turn-food-into-fuel-scientists-tracked-individual-atoms-to-find-out"&gt;more fuel for the body&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key molecular biomarkers related to aging showed improvements, too. While we already knew COX7RP was helpful to mitochondria, the study provides new insight into the difference it can potentially make to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;health and aging&lt;/a&gt; – and how these cell power generators could be influencing lifespan directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While many studies have reported shortened lifespans in disease models and interventions to overcome them, evidence for lifespan or healthspan extension under non-disease conditions remains limited," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/acel.70294"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Healthspan' refers to years of living independently, staying free from disease, and retaining good physical &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-breakthrough-lithium-reverses-memory-loss-in-mice"&gt;and mental health&lt;/a&gt; into old age. As the world's population gets older, these considerations are increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's becoming apparent that mitochondria play a central role in this process. Previous studies have linked problems with the cell power stations &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reverse-dementia-like-memory-loss-in-mice-by-supercharging-brain-cells"&gt;to dementia&lt;/a&gt;, and we also know health conditions like obesity &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/obesity-disrupts-mitochondria-and-we-may-have-figured-out-how"&gt;can disrupt mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this still needs to be confirmed in humans of course, but there could be some big clues here to support our chances of a healthy old age.

The findings suggest that psychological well-being acts as a precursor to self-control rather than a result of it. This research indicates that individuals who prioritize their emotional health may be better equipped to pursue long-term goals than those who rely solely on willpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychology has traditionally viewed self-control as a prized human capacity that is essential for a successful life. The general assumption holds that the ability to resist short-term temptations in favor of long-term goals leads to better health, career success, and financial security. By extension, scholars and the public alike often assume that exercising high self-control leads to increased happiness and life satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the popularity of this belief, the scientific evidence supporting a direct causal link from self-control to well-being has been inconclusive. Many previous studies relied on correlational data, which can show that two things are related but cannot determine which one causes the other. Other studies that attempted to track these variables over time faced methodological issues that made it difficult to draw firm conclusions about directionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work was driven by a significant gap in the existing research. For years, psychologists have operated under the strong assumption that self-control is a key driver of well-being,” said study author &lt;a href="https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/people/jia-lile/" target="_blank"&gt;Lile Jia&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore and director of &lt;a href="https://www.situatedgoalpursuit.com/" target="_blank"&gt;the Situated Goal Pursuit (SPUR) Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The narrative is that if you are more disciplined, you will be happier and more satisfied with life. However, when we examined the scientific literature, the causal evidence for this claim was surprisingly weak and fraught with issues. Most studies were correlational, and the few longitudinal studies attempting to establish causality had methodological limitations that made their conclusions ambiguous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, there are strong theoretical reasons to suspect the causal arrow might point in the opposite direction,” Jia explained. “For example, Barbara Fredrickson’s ‘broaden-and-build’ theory suggests that positive emotions—a core component of well-being—broaden our mindset and help us build personal resources. We reasoned that these resources could, in turn, facilitate better self-control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, the central motivation was to rigorously test these competing causal pathways. We wanted to clarify the directionality of this important relationship between self-control and well-being using more robust statistical methods (the RI-CLPM) and a three-wave longitudinal design, which is better suited for making causal inferences than the two-wave designs used in prior work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted two separate longitudinal studies. Study 1 involved 377 working adults recruited from an Asian country. The participants were part of a larger project regarding career development and lifelong learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected data from these participants at three distinct time points, with each wave separated by a six-month interval. This design allowed the team to track changes within the same individuals over a period of one year. To measure self-control, the participants completed a 20-item scale that assessed their ability to inhibit impulses, initiate work, and continue good behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the assessment of well-being, the participants responded to a scale designed to be culturally appropriate for the population. This measure included items asking about their levels of happiness, self-worth, and appreciation for life. The team also utilized a statistical technique known as the random intercept cross-lagged panel model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This specific analytical approach is significant because it separates stable personality traits from temporary fluctuations within a person. It allowed the researchers to determine if a specific increase in well-being at one time point predicted a subsequent increase in self-control at the next time point. By isolating these within-person changes, the model provides a stronger test for potential causal influence than traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results from the first study revealed a pattern that contradicted the traditional narrative. Earlier levels of self-control did not reliably predict improvements in well-being six months later. Simply exercising discipline did not appear to make participants happier in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the data supported the reverse hypothesis. Participants who reported higher levels of well-being at one time point exhibited greater self-control at the next measurement wave. Feeling well appeared to function as a precursor to functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure these findings were not specific to one culture or time interval, the researchers conducted a second study. Study 2 recruited a larger sample of 1,299 working adults in the United States. This study followed a similar three-wave design but utilized a shorter time frame to capture more immediate effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the American sample completed surveys once a month for three consecutive months. They answered the same self-control questions used in the first study. To measure well-being, they completed a scale assessing positive feelings, optimism, and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the American data yielded results that mirrored those of the Asian sample. High levels of self-control at the start of a month did not lead to increased well-being the following month. The anticipated reward of happiness following disciplined behavior did not materialize in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the reverse relationship remained significant and positive. Individuals who felt more optimistic and energetic at the beginning of the month demonstrated better self-control a month later. This replication across two different cultures and timeframes provides robust evidence that the primary direction of influence flows from well-being to self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most surprising result was the consistent lack of evidence for the popular belief that self-control predicts later well-being,” Jia told PsyPost. “Given how deeply this idea is embedded in both scientific thinking and popular culture, we expected to see at least a small effect in that direction. To find that the data from two separate studies so clearly supported only the path from well-being to self-control was quite striking. It really challenges a foundational assumption and underscores the need to re-evaluate how we think about these two critical aspects of a good life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted supplementary analyses to further check these patterns. In the first study, participants also provided daily reports of their mood and behavior for a week. These daily records showed that while positive emotions predicted self-control months later, self-control did not uniquely predict daily positive emotions when general well-being was taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose that positive emotions may help replenish the mental energy required to resist temptations and stick to difficult tasks. When people feel good, they may be more open to challenges and better at managing conflicting goals. This aligns with the idea that well-being acts as fuel for the engine of self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most important takeaway for the average person is to reconsider how they approach self-improvement,” Jia said. “The common advice is often to ‘just try harder’ or to focus on building discipline through sheer willpower. Our findings suggest a potentially more effective, and certainly more pleasant, alternative: &lt;em&gt;prioritize your well-being to build your self-control&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of viewing happiness as a reward you get after achieving your goals through discipline, think of well-being as the fuel that powers the engine of self-control. If you want to get better at resisting temptations, starting new projects, or sticking with good habits, a great first step is to invest in activities that make you feel happy, energetic, optimistic, and appreciative of life. Our research indicates that feeling well precedes functioning well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s strength lies in its use of a three-wave longitudinal design across two diverse cultural samples. But as with all research, there are some limitations. The statistical framework used relies on the assumption that the relationships between variables remain constant over time. It is also possible that unmeasured third variables, such as changes in sleep, stress, or social support, could influence both well-being and self-control simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the absence of a short-term effect does not mean self-control has no relationship with happiness. “A crucial caveat is that ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,'” Jia explained. “Our study failed to find a within-person causal effect of self-control on well-being, but this does not mean that self-control is unimportant for happiness altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that having high self-control as a stable, long-term trait contributes to a person’s overall life satisfaction (a between-persons effect), even if short-term fluctuations in self-control don’t cause short-term fluctuations in well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, the misinterpretation to avoid is thinking ‘self-control doesn’t matter for happiness.’ A more accurate interpretation is that if you are looking for a positive change, our evidence suggests that boosting your well-being is a more direct and effective way to improve your self-control, rather than the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore the specific mechanisms that allow well-being to improve self-control. It may be that positive moods accelerate habit formation or enhance cognitive flexibility. Understanding these processes could lead to better interventions for people struggling with self-regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The path to greater self-control doesn’t have to be a grim, effortful struggle,” Jia added. “Instead, it can be paved with positive experiences. By actively cultivating joy, engagement, and meaning in our lives, we are not just making ourselves feel better in the moment; we are also building the psychological resources we need to be more effective and successful in the future. It places the pursuit of well-being at the very center of personal growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506251385007" target="_blank"&gt;Feeling Well, Functioning Well: How Psychological Well-Being Predicts Later Self-Control, but Not the Other Way Around&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Shuna Shiann Khoo, Lile Jia, Ismaharif Ismail, Ying Li, Liangyu Xing, and Jolynn Pek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 11:04:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOWW96b2h5d1MwVjExeTJCdW1QRkVNc2xHSlFXSGpqblpVS0Ribm1ibXctdVRiZWtuZDBuM1NaMl81YW02XzE0bGJ6S3FxbUVoRHdIOWYtcXFpR3A4RXJkMHBlMFpGQVBCWTZqZjJSa1VOc3VBSlZ1cTVTSnFyUkNpbktTOURMMWZvcGM3dGloZTFZaTc2eFR0ZHl2OA</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州麻疹应对措施将个人选择置于订单之上- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/12/16/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-response</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 10:32:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBwaTFOMmt3a3RYVlZBR2lsbzdHcGQyVmQ4YkdiRHpITDBmRmFpVzV4dXd0VkhzWkpoR1pOaFFHSFUwbmNsYThKVzNtRFJyTEZFOWI2ajhkUmh2a2NuOUV6Zzh6UGhKbGgtYUdPSHJyVVNSQTFJRHRucGNwS3ZUQQ</guid></item><item><title>牙龈疾病可能与动脉斑块积聚有关，主要心血管疾病事件的风险更高- www.heart.org</title><link>https://newsroom.heart.org/news/gum-disease-may-be-linked-to-plaque-buildup-in-arteries-higher-risk-of-major-cvd-events</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="body-container" class="cBuilder article-body"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;DALLAS, Dec. 16, 2025 — There is increasing evidence that gum disease is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events, including &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack" target="_blank"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke" target="_blank"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/atrial-fibrillation" target="_blank"&gt;atrial fibrillation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-failure" target="_blank"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt; and cardiometabolic health conditions. Effective prevention and treatment of gum disease, also called periodontal disease, could potentially decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease, according to a new scientific statement published today in the American Heart Association’s flagship journal &lt;strong&gt;Circulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new American Heart Association scientific statement, “Periodontal Disease and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,” features new data supporting an association between periodontal disease and &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/ascvd" target="_blank"&gt;atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; (ASCVD) and updates the Association’s 2012 scientific statement. ACSVD, the leading cause of death globally, is caused by buildup of arterial plaque (fatty deposits in the arteries) and refers to conditions that include coronary heart disease, stroke, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/peripheral-artery-disease" target="_blank"&gt;peripheral artery disease&lt;/a&gt; and aortic aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Your mouth and your heart are connected,” said Chair of the scientific statement writing group Andrew H. Tran, M.D., M.P.H., M.S., FAHA, a pediatric cardiologist and the director of the preventive cardiology program at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. “Gum disease and poor oral hygiene can allow bacteria to enter the bloodstream, causing inflammation that may damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease. Brushing, flossing and regular dental checkups aren’t just about a healthy smile—they’re an important part of protecting your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlights of the statement include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting over 40% of U.S. adults over age 30. The earliest stage is gingivitis (inflammation of the gums due to buildup of oral plaque). If left untreated, gingivitis may progress to periodontitis, where the gums begin to pull away from the teeth, forming small pockets that can trap bacteria and lead to infection. The most advanced stage, severe periodontitis, involves extensive damage to the bones supporting the teeth; teeth may become loose and fall out. This stage often requires surgical intervention. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Periodontal disease is more common in individuals with poor oral hygiene and other cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/the-facts-about-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, overweight or obesity, diabetes and smoking. The prevalence of periodontal disease is also higher among men, older adults, individuals with low physical activity and people affected by adverse social determinants of health, such as lower socioeconomic status, food insecurity and/or lack of access to health care including dental care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Although periodontal disease and ASCVD share common risk factors, emerging data indicates there is an independent association between the two conditions. Potential biological mechanisms linking periodontal disease with poor cardiovascular outcomes include direct pathways such as bacteria in the blood and vascular infections, as well as indirect pathways such as chronic systemic inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Numerous studies have found that periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease and cardiac death. Although periodontal disease clearly contributes to chronic inflammation that is associated with ASCVD, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been confirmed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is also no direct evidence that periodontal treatment will help prevent cardiovascular disease. However, treatments that reduce the lifetime exposure to inflammation appear to be beneficial to reducing the risk of developing ASCVD. The treatment and control of periodontal disease and associated inflammation may contribute to the prevention and improved management of ASCVD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People with one or more cardiovascular disease risk factors are considered to be at higher risk and may benefit from regular dental screenings and targeted periodontal care to address chronic inflammation. Previous studies have found that more frequent tooth brushing is associated with lower 10-year ASCVD risk (13.7% for once-daily or less brushing vs. 7.35% for brushing three or more times per day) and reduced inflammatory markers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;More research, including long-term studies and randomized controlled trials, is needed to determine whether periodontal treatment can impact ASCVD progression and outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In addition, the role of socioeconomic status, access to dental care and other social factors that adversely affect health should be explored to develop targeted prevention and treatment strategies that can help reduce the prevalence and adverse outcomes of periodontal disease and ASCVD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

After the age of 35, we start losing muscle every single year. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;And that muscle is so important because it is your metabolism, your bone density, your energy, and just the ability to bounce back when life throws things at you,” says Tara.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can cardio and pilates alone keep you strong&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;She emphasises that cardio and &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/pilates" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Pilates"&gt;Pilates&lt;/a&gt; alone aren’t enough. “You need to lift, squat, push, pull, and press. It’s not about getting bulky and muscular, it’s about getting strong enough to handle ageing on your own terms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her advice is simple: “So if you’re tired of feeling like your body is working against you, start working with it. Pick up some weights. Your future self will thank you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strength training after 35 isn’t just about aesthetics; it’s about maintaining health, mobility, and resilience. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;As Tara highlights, incorporating resistance exercises into your routine is one of the best ways to support your body through the natural changes that come with age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This type of cancer is especially serious for men, &lt;/span&gt;Dr Surender Kumar Dabas, Robotic Cancer Surgeon, Manipal Hospitals, tells &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.healthshots.com/preventive-care/self-care/prostate-cancer-in-men-how-early-detection-can-help-in-treatment/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Health Shots"&gt;Health Shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt-10 mb-10 htEchoRecirculationWidget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's hard to identify exactly what causes &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/incredibly-lucky-rajdeep-sardesai-shares-his-prostate-cancer-journey-3-months-after-diagonosis-101760969129525.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="prostate cancer"&gt;prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt;, but certain factors increase the risk. These include age, family history, being overweight, and hormonal changes. “Early-stage prostate cancer often doesn’t have symptoms, making regular screening very important, especially for men over 40,” says the surgeon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5 common myths about prostate cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to raise awareness about prostate cancer, which helps with early detection and treatment. Here are five major myths that every man should stop believing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Myth 1: Only older men get prostate cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people think prostate cancer only impacts older men, especially those over 65. However, men in their 40s and 50s can also get prostate cancer, especially if they have a family history of the disease. A study by the American Cancer Society shows that about 1 in 10 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lives. Starting conversations and screenings around age 40 to 45 can help spot issues before they become serious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Myth 2: Prostate cancer doesn’t always come with symptoms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most dangerous myths is that if you feel fine, you are fine. This is not true. Many men with early-stage prostate cancer don’t show any symptoms. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;When symptoms do appear, like trouble urinating, needing to go to the bathroom often at night, or pelvic pain, they usually mean the cancer has progressed a lot”, says the doctor.&lt;/span&gt; That’s why it’s important to get annual screenings and talk to your healthcare provider, even if you feel healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Myth 3: Prostate cancer is a slow-growing cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some prostate cancers grow slowly, but this can lead to a false sense of security. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Not all tumours act the same way; some types of prostate cancer are aggressive and can spread quickly to other parts of the body, like the bones and lymph nodes.&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Aggressive prostate cancer can worsen rapidly and may need immediate treatment,” says Dr Dabas. Underestimating the seriousness of prostate cancer can result in missed chances for life-saving care.&lt;/span&gt; Your doctor will use tests such as biopsies, MRIs, and genetic tests to assess the severity of your condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Myth 4: Prostate cancer treatment can affect urinary and sexual function&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many men worry about the side effects of treatment, especially the risk of losing urinary or sexual function. However, new treatments for prostate cancer have improved and can reduce these risks. “&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Methods such as nerve-sparing surgery, robotic-assisted surgery, and targeted therapies aim to preserve this function," says the expert. It is important to talk openly with your doctor about these worries.&lt;/span&gt; This way, you can learn about modern treatment options that may help ease your concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Myth 5: All prostate cancers are deadly&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people believe that being diagnosed with prostate cancer means you will die. This is not true. The survival rate for prostate cancer is much higher than for many other cancers. A study by the American Cancer Society shows that about 98% of men diagnosed will live for at least five years. “It’s important to understand that prostate cancer can be quite different from one person to another, and many men will not die from it. Finding prostate cancer early through screening can lead to treatment options that improve survival chances,” says the doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Note to readers: &lt;/strong&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;While the holidays are meant for celebrations and time with family, research shows it’s also one of the most dangerous times for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association said &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/heart-attack-deaths-more-likely-during-winter-holiday-season-than-any-other-time-of-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;there are more cardiac-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day than any other time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s important that people are aware of this trend,” said Brian Case, an interventional cardiologist at MedStar Southern Maryland Hospital Center.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Be mindful of your health during the holidays,” Case said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could cause heart issues on holiday break? He said one aspect is stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Friends and family, that always could create some stress. And then also for people who don’t have friends and family who are alone, there’s an increased risk for stress and associated depression,” Case said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason is changes in habits surrounding food and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You might be drinking more, more alcohol intake, maybe a poor diet, less exercise during the holidays,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the classic symptoms of heart attacks are chest pain on the left side, shortness of breath and sweating. But sometimes, you can catch other signs such as feeling weak, fatigue and some reflux or discomfort in your stomach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So if you’re feeling any of these symptoms, it’s definitely important to get evaluated sooner than later,” Case said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Case said the American Heart Association found that there is a &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k4811" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;37% increase&lt;/a&gt; in heart attack deaths on Christmas Eve and a 15% increase in heart attack deaths between Dec. 26 and Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bananas' impact on blood sugar depends on glycemic index, ripeness level and fiber. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fiber and eating a less ripe banana can help blunt the blood sugar response. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pair your banana with proteins or healthy fats like Greek-style yogurt or nut butter. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bananas tend to peel open a whole debate, particularly about their effect on blood sugar. Often labeled as “too sugary” or a “high-carb fruit to avoid”, bananas end up with a bad reputation that doesn’t quite match how they actually affect your body. The full story is far more nuanced than simply calling them good or bad. The reality is that the way your blood sugar responds to eating a banana depends on factors that go beyond the grams of natural sugar they contain. To dismantle the myths, we spoke with dietitians to break down how bananas affect your blood sugar, why they can still fit into a balanced diet and smart ways to enjoy them without throwing your levels off balance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-bananas-affect-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Bananas Affect Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s easy to assume a food affects everyone in the same way, the same each time it’s consumed, but when it comes to bananas and blood sugar, several factors come into play. Those factors include the fruit’s glycemic index and load, level of ripeness and fiber content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The glycemic index (GI) is a tool used to estimate how fast blood sugar rises after eating a carbohydrate-rich food on a scale of 0 to 100. “Bananas have a moderate GI of 42 to 62,” says diabetes educator &lt;a href="https://whitnessnutrition.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whitney Stuart, M.S., RDN, CDECS.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But GI only measures speed, without capturing the entire picture.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is where glycemic load (GL) comes into play. GL accounts for both the GI and the amount of carbohydrates in a typical serving, explains Stuart.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; GL matters because blood sugar responses are driven by how much banana you actually eat and what you eat it with, not just how fast they are absorbed.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating a small or medium banana as part of a meal will have a very different impact on your blood sugar levels than a large banana eaten on its own. In fact, “a medium banana has a moderate GL, which means it’s less likely to cause rapid blood sugar spikes, especially when part of a balanced meal,” says Stuart.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Ripeness and Sugar Content &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A banana’s ripeness signals more than its taste and texture. It’s also a sign of how quickly the fruit may raise your blood sugar. “As a banana ripens, the starch turns into simple sugars, one of which is glucose,” says &lt;a href="https://www.kimrosedietitian.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kimberley Rose-Francis, RD, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She explains that green bananas, however, contain a type of carbohydrate called resistant starch.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Instead of breaking down into glucose, she highlights that resistant starch &lt;em&gt;resists&lt;/em&gt; digestion, making it beneficial for managing blood sugar levels.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “As they turn yellow with brown spots, resistant starch decreases and sugar levels rise, causing a quicker but still moderate spike in blood sugar compared to sweets,” Straut adds.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Fiber and Digestion &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to natural sugars, bananas contain fiber that impacts digestion and blood sugar response. Stuart shares that less than 10% of Americans meet their daily fiber goals. Fortunately, bananas are a good source of two types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. “Soluble fiber slows digestion and the absorption of sugars, helping to prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar. It also supports gut health by feeding beneficial gut bacteria,” she explains.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On the other hand, insoluble fiber supports digestive regularity.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Together, the fiber in bananas helps create a slower, more controlled blood sugar response compared with eating a snack like chips, crackers or cookies.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-bananas-can-still-be-part-of-a-healthy-diet-beyond-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why Bananas Can Still Be Part of a Healthy Diet (Beyond Blood Sugar) &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bananas are much more than their carbohydrate content. “Bananas are nutritional powerhouses! They’re rich in potassium, which supports heart health and helps regulate blood pressure,” says Stuart.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; She highlights that they are also packed with antioxidants like catechins and dopamine, which help to reduce inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not to mention, “bananas are a good source of vitamin B6. This vitamin is a part of over 100 enzyme reactions in the body. These reactions are important for the development of the nervous system, immune function and protein metabolism,” says Rose-Francis.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re also affordable, convenient and available all year long, which are qualities that matter for practical and sustainable nutrition. When eaten as part of a balanced diet, bananas play a meaningful role in supporting your overall health and shouldn’t be feared.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-smart-ways-to-enjoy-bananas-without-spiking-blood-sugar"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Smart Ways to Enjoy Bananas Without Spiking Blood Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re worried about bananas causing sharp blood sugar spikes, you can rest assured that there are simple solutions to keep your numbers steady. Here are several blood-sugar-friendly strategies both dietitians recommend for enjoying bananas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair it with protein and healthy fats&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of eating a banana on its own, pairing it with protein and healthy fats helps slow digestion and keep your blood sugar from rising too rapidly.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try adding chopped up banana to your Greek-style yogurt, blending it in a smoothie with protein powder or pairing it with a nut butter like almond or peanut butter for a quick and easy snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine it with other fiber-rich foods&lt;/strong&gt;: Adding your banana to high fiber foods like oatmeal or chia pudding can further help stabilize your blood sugar.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stick to proper portions&lt;/strong&gt;: Choose a small or medium banana instead of a large banana, which may contain more natural sugar.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reach for less ripe bananas&lt;/strong&gt;: Look for yellow bananas that are slightly green at the top. These have more resistant starch, which helps to keep your blood sugars in the right range.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s easy to assume that bananas are off-limits because of the natural sugars they contain. But the truth is that their sugar content is only one part of the equation. When it comes to your blood sugar response, factors such as the banana’s glycemic load and index, level of ripeness and fiber content also play a part in whether your blood sugar rises too high or remains steady. Smart strategies, like pairing your banana with protein and healthy fats, eating it alongside other fiber-rich foods, sticking to proper portions and reaching for greener bananas can all help keep your levels in the optimal range.

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/testosterone.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-19685" srcset="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/testosterone.jpg 908w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/testosterone-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/testosterone-200x150.jpg 200w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/testosterone-768x578.jpg 768w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/testosterone-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/testosterone-320x240.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;–&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a man of Science, I’m supposed to hide my enthusiasm about this somewhat controversial subject, and instead direct you only to the peer-reviewed studies. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But man, I feel like I’ve stumbled upon the fountain of youth here. And the more I dig into the details and the hype and controversy surrounding the field of Hormone Replacement therapy, the more I need to share the word about it to my fellow middle-aged people (both men and women). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But first a quick backstory:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve been interested in optimization and trying to get the most out of my body and mind since I was a little kid. I started vacuuming up all the training and nutrition books and magazines I could find while I was just a teenager, and that field still remains a favorite of mine over 30 years later. And if you’re a long-time reader here you’ve been reminded plenty of times of this interest, because health has always been the very heart of Mustachianism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But a funny thing has been happening in the last ten years: even as I kept honing the healthy living habits and trying my best to improve, there seemed to be a force pulling me back almost as hard. So despite working a bit harder and smarter every year, I still felt myself riding a gradually declining tide of energy, motivation, and physical stamina. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Perhaps this is just what it means to grow old”&lt;/em&gt;, I thought to myself, &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But I’m still gonna keep fighting it!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet there was one thing that didn’t quite fit. Why was &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; having this decline in energy, when some of my older friends weren’t? And why was I still seeing people out there in their 50s, 60s and well beyond doing things that I felt too tired to do today?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-1 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these tireless friends is a guy named Kevin, who is the personification of the highly energetic successful middle-aged man. He’s a semi-retired serial entrepreneur (and extreme rock climber) who lives in Boulder.  And through an interesting twist of fate, in April of 2025 he invited me out for a hike right around the time I was doing all this wondering. And during this hike (and climb) he told me about his latest venture, a boutique men’s health company that specializes in helping men just like us get their youth back through the process of &lt;strong&gt;testosterone replacement therapy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/climb-w-kevin-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-19687" srcset="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/climb-w-kevin-1.jpg 759w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/climb-w-kevin-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/climb-w-kevin-1-135x180.jpg 135w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/climb-w-kevin-1-113x150.jpg 113w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Kevin even showed me the (literal) ropes of climbing Boulder’s Flatirons mountains for the first time&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Long story short: his ideas planted a seed in my head, which led to a bunch of research and a growing interest in trying TRT myself. I had of course heard about the process, but for some reason never considered doing it until I heard Kevin’s enthusiasm: he had been on it for several years, and according to him it is a “night and day difference” in all the things you want in life: energy, focus, thinking speed, and of course physical health.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dr-bender-presentation.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-19689" srcset="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dr-bender-presentation.jpg 844w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dr-bender-presentation-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dr-bender-presentation-200x155.jpg 200w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dr-bender-presentation-768x593.jpg 768w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/dr-bender-presentation-150x116.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This is the key slide from a presentation Kevin’s company gave on TRT. Yes, it sounds like hype when you present it this way, but these are just the physiological  properties of Testosterone itself, not just TR therapy. Which is why it’s such a valuable thing to try to maximize the hormone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another convenient twist of fate is that I happen to be dating an REI doctor – a Reproductive Endocrinologist and Infertility specialist who has two board certifications in exactly the relevant bodily systems that are affected by these hormones. And while she was initially skeptical that I needed more Testosterone (and in her practice she regularly sees the downsides of men taking the stuff too early in life and thus compromising their own fertility), she has followed along and helped me learn at each step of this process, eventually becoming fully in support of the program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I signed up as a test customer for Kevin’s new company, which is called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bolt.health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bolt Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I worked with their doctor to get a baseline blood test and review my numbers compared to all the past tests I’ve collected, and as it turned out, my levels &lt;em&gt;had &lt;/em&gt;been dropping consistently over the years, and the latest test was by far the lowest ever. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even more telling, my age-related drop in Testosterone was correlating perfectly with my decline in energy and motivation:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/T-vs-date.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19690" srcset="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/T-vs-date.png 651w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/T-vs-date-300x185.png 300w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/T-vs-date-200x124.png 200w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/T-vs-date-150x93.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These are my total T numbers from blood tests dating back to 2012. The “free” testosterone number is actually even more important than total, but it usually correlates pretty closely under normal conditions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The next step was a prescription for a tiny daily dose of supplemental T, which arrived at my house the next week along with instructions for how to use it. And so began the journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now let’s jump forward seven months to the present day as I write this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And wow, what a great year it has been! I only wish I had known and tried this a few years earlier, because I’m getting a lot more out of my life. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not a night-and-day difference for me, but more like a 50% boost in overall youthfulness and energy. The biggest subjective change is that I just &lt;em&gt;don’t have sucky tired days anymore&lt;/em&gt;, which was the main problem with my life before: wasting too much of my precious freedom due to not having the energy to enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is why I’ve become somewhat of an evangelist for hormone replacement therapy for people from about age 45 onwards. It won’t work for everyone – if your levels are already pretty high, you don’t get the same boost. Two of my male friends tried TRT and quit because they didn’t notice any benefit. But these same two guys already had plenty of energy to begin with, which is usually a sign that the body has what it needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRT’s Sketchy Reputation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out I am very late to this party. Although Testosterone supplementation started out as a niche practice in the 1940s, from the 2010s onward it has been everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TRT is the reason you see every actor suddenly showing up buff overnight for their superhero roles and it’s also why so many of today’s CEOs don’t look anything like yesterday’s CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend-1024x444.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-19691" srcset="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend-1024x444.jpg 1024w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend-300x130.jpg 300w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend-200x87.jpg 200w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend-768x333.jpg 768w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend-150x65.jpg 150w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CEO-trend.jpg 1417w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;–&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt; In many cases, it has gone too far with young men using it just to gain muscle for the beach or the football field, and questionable online providers (aka “Prescription Mills”) handing out prescriptions to anyone with a valid credit card – with profit as their sole motive. It became overhyped in certain pockets of Bro Culture, where every Bro eventually receives the advice &lt;em&gt;“Bro! You need to get on the T!”&lt;/em&gt; from another Bro, and therefore does it. And some of this reputation surely contributed to my own skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But there’s a lot of valid science behind TRT, if you’re the right candidate and you take the right dosage. And because of that, I feel it is probably &lt;em&gt;under-&lt;/em&gt;hyped in my own demographic, the Nerdy Tech Worker Semi Retired Dad contingent. And that’s why I’m writing this blog post, because there are a lot of us out there. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of us just tend to work with what we were given, and accept that aging means slowing down. And for those of us already enjoying an early retirement, we have the option of unlimited rest and recuperation time, so who really cares if we get tired a bit more often? After all, what better way to flex one’s wealth than with a decadent Tuesday Afternoon Nap while everyone else is stuck in the office?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this seemingly healthy attitude has a lot of positive aspects, it can also mask a real problem which may be easily fixable. Because sometimes, the only thing that’s even better than an afternoon nap, is having the energy and motivation to go out for an afternoon hike, bike ride or adventure with friends. More energy is also pretty darned useful if you’re still raising kids or trying to do well in your career as a person over 45.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it Actually Works (and What Happened to Me)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Distilling all of the fluffy discussion above into the simplest possible answer: TRT means using a tiny needle to inject a few drops of clear liquid just below the surface of your skin. And you do this by yourself at home, ideally once every morning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mini-needle-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-19692" srcset="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mini-needle-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mini-needle-1-300x188.jpg 300w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mini-needle-1-200x125.jpg 200w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mini-needle-1-768x480.jpg 768w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/mini-needle-1-150x94.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;–&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s one of the baby needles I use for my daily dose.&lt;br&gt;The typical serving is less than one tenth of a milliliter, which is only a few drops.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And while the term “needle” sounds scary to some, this is very different from the monstrosities they use to draw blood from your veins. This one is so miniature that you don’t need special training to use it, and you usually don’t even feel it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So I began doing this to myself on May 1st of this year, while keeping a daily journal of my results along the way. The results seemed to be almost immediate in all the promised areas, but I know how powerful the Placebo Effect can be so I kept my skeptic’s hat on to see what would happen in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I was seeing increased energy and motivation as well as lean weight gain through the whole spring and summer, but I remember the first truly shocking observation happened during a mountain vacation in July. I was part of a multi-family trip with lively adults, chaotic kids, early mornings, late nights with a few drinks, very intense high altitude sunshine and nonstop physical activities. It was just the type of situation that would drain my energy pretty quickly in the past. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But on day three I went out on a solo mountain bike ride to explore the area, and as I was climbing a long ascent with the blazing sun cooking me from every angle I just somehow kept having plenty of energy to &lt;em&gt;keep climbing. &lt;/em&gt;Then I came down and joined the group for a few games of full-sun pickleball, biked back up the mountain to our cabin, and the story of unlimited energy went on from there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Hot Damn”&lt;/em&gt;, I thought to myself, &lt;em&gt;“I don’t know whose youthful and tireless body I have inherited here but I’d sure like to keep it!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August, the Bolt Health program scheduled a follow-up blood test for me and sure enough, my Testosterone levels had been boosted from 415 to 730ng/dL, bringing me from the low side of normal to the higher side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Many labs define “normal” as anywhere between 300 and 1000, which seems strange to me given the huge effect this hormone has on your wellbeing. It’s a bit like saying “Most cars have between 90 and 300 horsepower, so it doesn’t really matter what engine you have” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I mean yeah, either one will still get you down the road, but which one would you rather be driving?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since then, it has just been more of the same good results. My improvements ramped up and then just stayed there – so I’m operating at a new, much higher and more enjoyable level of functioning. Energy and motivation are no longer a problem, and I even find myself willing to make longer-term plans again (before this everything beyond same-day planning felt overwhelming). And my body seems to just &lt;em&gt;want &lt;/em&gt;to gain strength and size with any excuse. Heavy weights feel lighter and the hard manual labor I still like to spend my time on feels easier for longer. It’s nice to be young again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So Why Doesn’t Everyone Do This?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you dig into the details, hormone replacement is mired in a soup of both real and incorrect information about both its benefits and its risks. And then our well-meaning medical establishment locks this whole container of soup deep in the cabinet with a label that says, “Needs Further Study”. But if you summarize the findings on both sides of the issue, you’ll see this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuff you should do BEFORE trying TRT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern American Lifestyle is a Testosterone and Health Crusher. It’s a miracle that &lt;em&gt;anybody &lt;/em&gt;feels good &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; with the crap that people do to their bodies. So if you’re not already doing all the simple, natural, outdoor things that naturally boost your health, energy, and hormone levels, you’ll want to start with these first. You can find a pretty complete list on my oft-cited &lt;a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/badassity-tracker.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Badassity Tracker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since I was already doing all of these things pretty consistently, I felt ready to take the next step and at least consider hormone supplementation. But wait, there’s more!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks of TRT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decreased fertility for men hoping to conceive&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increased production of red blood cells, which may increase the risk of blood clots for people with certain risk factors (a good provider should screen you for these risks before prescribing)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Potential worsening of certain prostrate conditions if you already have them&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Mood fluctuations and acne, especially if the dosing is way off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Dosing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the problems above are more likely to appear when the body is flooded with too much testosterone. In the bad old days, TRT was administered by sticking a pellet beneath your skin or injecting a large amount into the butt which then gets used up over the next several weeks. One friend recounted a story of extreme moodiness when the pellet was first implanted, ramping down to tiredness by the time the hormone was all gone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More modern providers like Bolt have fixed this problem by breaking the dose into &lt;em&gt;much &lt;/em&gt;smaller servings which you administer each day. The idea is that your levels remain stable, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;you need a lot less overall which reduces side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For my part, I have not had any of the negative side effects because I was a pretty ideal candidate in the first place: 50 years old with depressed Testosterone levels but an otherwise healthy lifestyle and no risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Internet TRT Police&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My hope in sharing this article is to be transparent and hopefully take some of the stigma out of this subject of other people who might benefit. Because in our modern over-connected world, everybody has an opinion on your life, even when you didn’t ask them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1-1024x281.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-19694" srcset="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1-1024x281.jpg 1024w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1-300x82.jpg 300w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1-200x55.jpg 200w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1-768x211.jpg 768w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1-150x41.jpg 150w, https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TRT-police1.jpg 1482w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A member of the Internet TRT Police stepped in on Twitter as soon as I mentioned this idea there.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just men – many women in this same age group benefit from Estrogen replacement (and there are even interesting stories about female testosterone supplementation in certain situations as &lt;a href="https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/testosterone-gave-me-my-life-back"&gt;this author shares)&lt;/a&gt;. The point is that aging is normal, but in some cases there’s a pretty easy way to make it slower&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Much Does this Cost?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The great news is that Testosterone itself is a cheap and widely available substance, typically under $50 per month even for people like me without conventional insurance or drug coverage. The expensive part (here in the US) is just the doctor stuff – consultations, blood tests, ongoing analysis and prescription renewals and so on. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The company that I used is positioned as a premium provider, bundling these services along with a bunch of other men’s health perks and deliveries for a few hundred dollars, which is expensive relative to most other parts of my budget, but still cheap if I consider the life and financial benefits of being 20-50% more energetic and productive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want to be on this program, your final decision will hinge on your income, insurance coverage if applicable, whether your existing doctor can already help you, and how much service and advice you’re willing to pay for. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;I decided &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to become a Bolt health affiliate because I wanted to write this article without conflict of interest. And I can honestly say, Bolt’s product and service seem great to me because I know and trust the people who run it. But  it’s also the only one I’ve tried. So I don’t know much about the competition and there may be other good options out there. At the very minimum, you can always try one service and switch to another if you don’t like the first one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve got lots more to say on money and early retirement, and lots of interesting projects in the works now too. So I’m thankful to have stumbled upon this booster for &lt;em&gt;all &lt;/em&gt;aspects of life, so I can do more of everything else, for even more decades than I had expected. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I wish this same type of good fortune for you, however you create it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Comments:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Do you have questions about hormone replacement or anything else in this article? I’ll try to invite Kevin, Dr. Sean Bender and other knowledgeable people to contribute and answer questions as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Current medical screening techniques could be failing to catch nearly half of those who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-study-links-99-of-heart-attacks-and-strokes-with-four-risk-factors"&gt;experience a heart attack&lt;/a&gt;, according to new research, suggesting many of the millions of heart attacks that happen each year could be prevented with improved methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-is-vulnerable-these-4-things-will-help-you-protect-it"&gt;heart attack risk&lt;/a&gt; is typically assessed according to a set of criteria such as an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (&lt;a href="https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3398/ascvd-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease-2013-risk-calculator-aha-acc"&gt;ASCVD&lt;/a&gt;) score, which measures factors linked to the development of cardiovascular disease.

The data included details such as medical history, blood pressure, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-drug-lowers-bad-cholesterol-by-58-in-clinical-trial"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/is-melatonin-bad-for-your-heart-an-expert-explains-the-new-findings"&gt;Is Melatonin Bad For Your Heart?

It determines the risk of a heart attack &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/strokes-are-rising-among-under-55s-do-you-know-what-to-look-for"&gt;or stroke&lt;/a&gt; within the next 10 years based on contributing factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol, age, sex, and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those identified as being at intermediate or high risk of a heart attack – high risk being a 20 percent or higher chance of an incident over the next decade – are typically put on preventative measures &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/statins-could-reduce-dementia-risk-even-in-people-with-low-cholesterol"&gt;such as statins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that more needs to be done to better assess heart attack risk in groups without any symptoms – &lt;span&gt;people who wouldn't have been flagged &lt;/span&gt;by these current tools – perhaps by actually testing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;for signs of atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (the fatty plaques in the arteries that obstruct blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we look at heart attacks and trace them backwards, most heart attacks occur in patients in the low or intermediate risk groups," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/current-heart-attack-screening-tools-are-not-optimal-and-fail-to-identify-half-the-people-who-are-at-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Anna Mueller, an internal medicine resident at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights that a lower risk score, along with not having classic heart attack symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath, which is common, is no guarantee of safety on an individual level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research needs to be put in some context: the case histories of only a few hundred people were analyzed retrospectively, and PREVENT scores &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.123.067626"&gt;have shown promise&lt;/a&gt; in detecting heart attack risk in large groups of people, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, those scores also seem to miss people who don't present with typical symptoms or risk factors, according to the researchers. If better, more personalized approaches can be found, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; can be spotted and prevented earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study suggests that the current approach of relying on risk scores and symptoms as primary gatekeepers for prevention is not optimal," &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2025/current-heart-attack-screening-tools-are-not-optimal-and-fail-to-identify-half-the-people-who-are-at-risk"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Ahmadi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.102361"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coca-Cola has been a staple brand whenever the craving for a carbonated beverage hits for over a century, thanks to its delicious, sweet flavor. Now, the brand is offering a notable formula switch for the first time in nearly 40 years—and it has sparked some serious chatter among fans online. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coca-Cola has launched a new way for customers to enjoy its iconic beverage—an 8-ounce glass bottle made with &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/types-of-sugar/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cane sugar&lt;/a&gt; rather than high-fructose corn syrup, now available at retail locations nationwide. This marks the first widespread reintroduction of cane sugar in U.S. Coca-Cola products since the 1980s, when the company transitioned to high-fructose corn syrup.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The brand first introduced the cane-sugar formula this fall in a 12-ounce single-serve glass bottle served at select restaurants across the U.S. This launch followed &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/coca-cola-cane-sugar-soda-announcement-11776833" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;the company's announcement in July&lt;/a&gt; that it would begin replacing high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in certain products after fan demand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're worried about a change in flavor from what you know and love, don’t fret, the original taste of the beloved soda is still very present. Many people who have tried it compared it to &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/mexican-coca-cola-drinks-at-costco-11713335" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Coca-Cola sold in Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, which already uses cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup and comes in a glass bottle.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "To me, the Mexican version is more syrupy and sweet, while the U.S. version is more acidic and punchy," one person wrote.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another added, "This version is the best. I am kind of glad it is only 8 ounces because it forces you to be strategic when consuming."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re still skeptical of the change, rest assured that there’s plenty of room on shelves for &lt;a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/coca-cola-where-to-find-tab-11849214" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;all the sweet options&lt;/a&gt;. As a Coca-Cola spokesperson told Allrecipes, "This launch reflects our ongoing commitment to giving people more ways to enjoy the beverages they love," and that the cane-sugar Coke is an addition—not a replacement—to the existing lineup.&lt;br&gt;

It puts beyond doubt the dangers associated with using these devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists from Northwestern Medicine and the University of California, San Francisco wanted to better understand the relationship between indoor tanning and cancer development, particularly with these machines rising in popularity among younger generations. &lt;a class="Link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/1790352" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that there are more tanning salons in Florida than McDonald's outlets, and that up to 40% of teenage girls and 20% of 18- to 29-year-olds have used one of these devices in the previous 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at the medical records of 32,315 patients seen by the Dermatology service at Northwestern University, with 7,474 of these individuals having reported tanning bed usage. The extent of use was detailed in 2,932 patients, which formed the study's “epidemiological case” cohort. Then, for a control cohort, the researchers randomly selected 2,925 people from the 24,841 patients with no history of tanning bed usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that melanoma was diagnosed in 5.1% of indoor tanners compared with 2.1% of non-users. After adjusting for variables – age, sex, sunburn and family history – tanning bed use resulted in a 2.85-fold increase in melanoma risk. These users were also more likely to develop skin cancers on parts of their body that had rarely been exposed to sun, such as the lower back and buttocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In outdoor sun exposure, maybe 20% of your skin gets the most damage,” said study first author Dr. Pedram Gerami, professor of skin cancer research at Northwestern University. “In tanning bed users, we saw those same dangerous mutations across almost the entire skin surface.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delving further, the team conducted single-cell DNA sequencing on the pigment-producing skin cells where melanoma originates, known as melanocytes, from three donor groups. Group one featured 11 patients with a long history of using tanning beds. Group two included nine patients who had never used one but matched for age, sex and cancer risk. And group three featured skin from six cadavers as further controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is where it got really interesting – and somewhat frightening. With 182 individual melanocytes sequenced, the researchers quickly noticed that the cells of indoor tanners contained almost twice the number of mutations as the control samples, and these changes were more likely to be melanoma-linked ones. And the damage was more likely to be in those shielded-from-the-sun areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even in normal skin from indoor tanning patients, areas where there are no moles, we found DNA changes that are precursor mutations that predispose to melanoma,” said Dr Gerami. “That has never been shown before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the melanomas they develop are much like those seen in people who have inherited a genetic risk of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Young tanning bed users, without a family history of melanoma, periodically develop multiple melanomas on body sites that receive low cumulative sun damage," the team noted. "The presentation of tanning bed-induced melanomas is reminiscent of familial melanoma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanning beds first hit the US market in the 1970s, and by the mid-2010s, had grown into a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335516000048" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;US$3-billion-a-year industry&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2013, an estimated 7.8 million women and 1.9 million men in the US hit the "sunbed" each year, usually frequently. According to the World Health Organization, tanning beds are are a &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.compoundchem.com/2023/07/14/carcinogens/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;, meaning there is sufficient scientific evidence that they cause cancer in humans. (Smoking, alcohol and processed meats are also in this group.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you buy a pack of cigarettes, it says this may result in lung cancer,” he said. “We should have a similar campaign with tanning bed usage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enhancement" data-align-center&gt;
            &lt;div class="Enhancement-item"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

                
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, the FDA attempted to ban people under the age of 18 from using tanning beds and require all adults to sign a consent form acknowledging that they know the risks that come with this specific ultraviolet light exposure. But 10 years on the responsibility has fallen to state and local governments to restrict or ban the service. California was the first state to ban indoor tanning for minors in 2012, and since then, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.skincancer.org/blog/indoor-tanning-legislation-heres-stand/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;43 more states have banned or at least restricted tanning bed use&lt;/a&gt; for those under 18. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia, which has the highest rate of melanoma in the world, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://melanoma.org.au/about-melanoma/melanoma-facts/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;banned the use of tanning beds&lt;/a&gt; outright in 2015, but it wasn't the first country to do so. Brazil banned cosmetic indoor tanning in 2009, but allows it for some medical conditions. It's worth noting that the tanning bed industry lobby in these countries was relatively small at the time of the bans – however, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5710080/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;both Europe and the US have powerful lobby groups&lt;/a&gt; fighting more US restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the high levels of mutational damage in skin cells from tanning bed users, it is difficult to justify marketing claims that the spectra of UV radiation in tanning beds are safer than natural sunlight," the study's researchers concluded. "Another popular claim by tanning advocates is that a pre-vacation tan can photoadapt skin in anticipation of recreational sun exposure. However, we see that tanning bed usage raises the mutation burden and risk of melanoma particularly in skin cells that receive low cumulative sun damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tanning bed exposures are often thought of as a substitute for natural UV radiation despite differences in the maximum doses, UV content, body sites exposed, and patterns of melanoma that arise," they said. "Our work highlights unique ways in which tanning beds shape the mutational landscapes of skin cells, helping to explain the distinctive presentations of melanoma in this patient population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma – the deadliest type of skin cancer – kills an estimated 11,000 people in the US every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ady4878" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a class="Link" href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/12/tanning-beds-triple-melanoma-risk-potentially-causing-broad-dna-damage" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol. The boxed warning, FDA's most serious type, cautions that drinking while taking the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, have been limited. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval “reflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women’s sexual health is understood and prioritized.” The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The diagnosis is not universally accepted, and some psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug's modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women's rights issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

So, how to stay healthy for the next two weeks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="8198acdb-d59d-4a90-8324-fb0c6ee0fca4" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;1. Do we really need to wear a mask?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some hospitals have already reinstated masks for staff, patients and visitors and, while the guidance remains advisory rather than compulsory for people with flu symptoms, a glance around buses and trains confirms that some are taking it seriously. Asked whether people who are coughing and spluttering with a cold should wear a mask to the office, Elkeles said: “I think that would be very sensible to all their colleagues, or probably their colleagues would say, ‘Please go home.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Baumgardt says some research has shown protection against viruses is enhanced when masks are worn consistently, but, as we all remember from lockdown, it needs to be the right sort of mask, positioned in the right way on your face and coupled with other measures such as personal hygiene. “You see a lot more people pulling their scarf around their face or their coat collar up at the moment, which won’t really have much effect,” Baumgardt says. “The best way to prevent the spread of a virus is still by washing your hands or using antibacterial gel, but your body also needs rest, so it is wise to take it easy and stay at home.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/flu-hospitalisations-record-level-nhs-wes-streeting-0xrbkmcd5" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wes Streeting: NHS risks collapse from strikes threat and ‘superflu’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4bcc92a4-32e6-4cf7-862a-39fc39693965" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;2. It’s not too late to get a flu jab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A mutated version of the flu virus, dubbed H3N2 “subclade K”, is circulating, and experts are predicting the number of people catching it will only rise in the coming weeks. “There are still some flu vaccines available and the NHS has sent out a flu jab SOS,” Baumgardt says. “It is worth asking at your GP or pharmacy if you are eligible and haven’t had one yet.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If you are over 65, or have a weakened immune system, are pregnant or have underlying health issues you should have been invited for a flub jab on the NHS. Vaccines are available privately from high street chemists for about £20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Although not 100 per cent effective, what we have in terms of a vaccine this year offers the best protection available,” Baumgardt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ad2617e2-57df-4052-b466-2c97a3ac2b17" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;3. Using a nasal spray could keep colds, flu and chest infections at bay&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Last year a study led by Paul Little, professor in primary care research at the University of Southampton, found that using inexpensive over-the-counter nasal sprays could minimise the chances of getting colds, chest infections and flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a trial funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research and involving more than 13,000 patients around the UK, Little and colleagues from Southampton and the University of Bristol asked patients to use either Vicks First Defence gel-based nasal spray, a saline nasal spray — a mixture of salt and water — or to follow advice online promoting physical activity and stress management. Advice was to use the nasal spray six times a day from the earliest symptoms of a cold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Results published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine showed that while the exercise and stress advice produced a 5 per cent reduction in symptoms, both varieties of nasal spray — available without a prescription from £4.50 at pharmacies — resulted in a 20 per cent reduction in symptoms and cut the days the illness lasted by a similar percentage. “Given these results, our advice to people is, if possible, at the first sign of cough, sore throat, cold or flu-like symptoms, use a nasal spray to prevent it from developing,” Little says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="23db7f61-de40-41d2-9eb2-e3a532bec8e5" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;4. Suck a peppermint to clear a stuffy head&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This is the advice of Professor Andy Smith from Cardiff University’s School of Psychology, who recently published a study in the World Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences showing that peppermints increase alertness in people who feel sluggish with a cold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Smith says that vapours such as mint have been shown in previous research to have therapeutic benefits, and in tests he has conducted comparing the effects of sucking on peppermints with butterscotch or no sweets at all, peppermints were found to soothe the signals from the body to the brain. “Our results confirmed that mild upper respiratory tract illnesses — the common cold — are associated with slower psychomotor speed and reduced alertness,” Smith says. “But sucking on a peppermint, compared to a butterscotch or nothing, during a cold can increase your alertness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="b8c8d635-8fca-4706-af8d-1382bf2ff875" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;5. Take a zinc lozenge only when you get the sniffles or a sore throat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Zinc is needed for immune cells to function and is not stored in the body, so you need a regular supply from sources including meat, poultry, shellfish, nuts and seeds. But unless you are diagnosed with a deficiency, taking a daily zinc supplement long term is not recommended because it can cause an upset stomach and interfere with the absorption of other minerals in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It’s worth keeping some zinc lozenges on standby, though, because the body’s requirement for it increases when you have an infection such as a cold. “It might help to prevent a cold virus binding to the lining of the nose,” says Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex and author of &lt;i&gt;Immune to Age&lt;/i&gt;. “But small doses of 10-40mg at the first sign of an infection and for a few days are all that is needed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/guide-to-beans-r9jjlspt0" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why we should eat beans every day — and which are the healthiest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f5ca12db-3581-49e6-806c-da8dc2a39699" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;6. Have some chicken (or turkey) soup to reduce cold symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2025 review by scientists at the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) and the University of Adelaide may have proved your grandmother right by confirming that chicken-based soups made with vegetables and herbs “offer modest benefits for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) [such as a cold], particularly for symptom relief and inflammation”. Writing in the journal Nutrients, the lead author, Sandra Lucas, a senior lecturer in the School of Health Sciences at UWS, explains that “soup is thought to support recovery through hydration, warmth, nutritional content, and possible anti-inflammatory effects”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Macciochi says that, in addition to vitamins and minerals that could help to ease mucus and inflammation in the airways, there are beneficial substances in chicken or turkey soup that might further combat a cold. “These include carnosine, which supports immune cells, and properties released as poultry is cooked that resemble the drug acetylcysteine that is prescribed for respiratory ailments,” Macciochi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5e784be8-a09d-48b1-852f-ad23e2809083" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;7. Try bouillon for your hangover&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Drink more than your liver can metabolise and you cannot expect to avoid a hangover — however, there are strategies to reduce the symptoms of a dry mouth and thumping head. From probiotics and milk thistle extract to recovery patches, each festive season brings a new remedy promising to spare us from the suffering of overindulgence. Do any of them really work, though? It’s unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A 2022 review by the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London looked at 21 published trials of clove extract, red ginseng, Korean pear juice and other hangover cures and found that, while some did show statistically significant improvements in symptoms, all evidence was of very low quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.31"&gt;&lt;div id="01f83cb8-5ee0-48ed-ae38-bcbe98416f16"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Drinking bouillon soup, a good source of vitamins and minerals, may help with a hangover&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Obviously stopping after one glass of champagne instead of three is the best preventive measure, but if restraint hasn’t worked, rehydration is the next step. “One of the causes of a hangover is dehydration, due to the fact that alcohol has a diuretic effect,” Baumgardt says. “Drinking plenty of water or diluted juice before you go to bed and the next morning is the best way to combat it.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Eating something the next morning will also help — “a full English works for me,” Baumgardt says, “but a piece of toast is better than nothing” — as it will raise your blood sugar and help you to feel closer to normal. Taking an ibuprofen may ease your thumping head, but doing so is not free from risk, as it can irritate the stomach lining, increasing the risk of stomach bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Things should slowly improve as you rest, eat and drink more,” Baumgardt says. Consider some bouillon soup, a thin, vegetable-based broth, as a good source of vitamins and minerals including &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;alt and potassium, later on. The charity Drinkaware says that even the NHS recommends bouillon as a potential recovery aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="58d62152-6aee-4e69-9e53-9fe27b27c8cf" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;8. If you are going to take a preventive supplement, choose vitamin D over C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Unless you are deficient in the first place, taking mega-doses of vitamin C will do little to prevent the risk of catching a winter virus. “A lot of people are obsessed with vitamin C in winter, but a better option for fighting off winter ailments is vitamin D, which carries much more evidence and is one to consider,” Baumgardt says. “The NHS says we should all take a 10mcg supplement during the winter and it will help your immune health.” If you do catch a cold, taking 1-2g vitamin C daily from the first onset of symptoms might help to shorten the worst of it, according to a review of ten published trials by researchers from the Australian National University and the University of Helsinki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="15fbf4cd-fe1f-4514-8aca-7f14fffa1ad3" class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;9. Try turmeric for indigestion (but don’t expect miracles)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Most supplements commonly taken to offset the digestive impact of overindulgence won’t have much effect. “Milk thistle and artichoke extract have a big following,” but there’s not much evidence they really help with indigestion or with acid reflux,” says the nutritionist Rob Hobson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A study by researchers at Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Medicine in Bangkok in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine did show that turmeric could be as effective as medicine for reducing excess stomach acid and Baumgardt says simple over-the-counter medications such as Rennie are worth keeping in your cabinet. Others, such as Gaviscon, produce a layering effect on top of the stomach and coat the lining of the oesophagus, protecting it from acid and other components of stomach juice. “Of course, not overindulging on rich foods is the best way to avoid after-effects,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQMVU2ZDFoWmxxTHE2eWoxSTV4YkswOGthRElOTXI4Ql9EOXlEUFpjQW8yMzh2cFZaNkQ1QW5sb2lYLTB0U2ZYTzMteVcteHM0clhBRkNtUGtRNEhhRW1tRWlLdGZUZ0otSG4tWGxJV0VDd0xYTHFJQWxkVHdkdUJFYlhBSmZQM0VEZVN0c0Q3MERSYWsySTcyRkxPdXlEQTdwdUFWZk1VTzBoQQ</guid></item><item><title>我们请3位营养师为最健康的三明治面包命名，他们都同意-非常简单</title><link>https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-sandwich-bread-according-to-dietitians-11867088</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="realsimple-sc-page_1-0" class="comp realsimple-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-callout--summary realsimple-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians unanimously recommend this specific bread as the healthiest sandwich option thanks to its high fiber, protein, and nutrient content.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for simple ingredient lists and minimal added sugar and sodium—ideally under 200 mg per slice—to avoid hidden additives and support long-term health goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprouted breads not only offer a lower glycemic response and better digestibility, but they’re also widely available and versatile enough for both sandwiches and creative recipes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The bread aisle is more extensive than ever. With a wide range of options—many marketed as ‘healthy’—it can be tricky to know which loaf to choose, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/best-sandwich-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sandwiches&lt;/a&gt;. After all, while store-bought bread can be used in a variety of recipes, a classic sandwich is where many of those slices are ultimately headed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But not all sandwich breads are created equal in terms of health benefits. Some are full of whole food ingredients and packed with a variety of nutrients, while others may contain additives, preservatives, added sugar, and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-foods-high-in-sodium-7564072" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sky-high levels of sodium&lt;/a&gt;. “Ingredients and preparation methods make all the difference when choosing a bread,” says Brittany Brown, RD, IBCLC, CDE, registered dietitian and owner of Feeding Babies Nourishing Souls in Nova Scotia, Canada.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When it comes to labeling bread as healthy or not, calories don't tell the full story. To &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-bread-7570769" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pick healthier bread&lt;/a&gt;, my non-negotiables are &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-much-fiber-do-you-need-a-day-7564730" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; and low added sugar,” shares Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed, RDN, LD, CDCES, certified diabetes educator and dietitian in Cleveland, Ohio. She often chooses a loaf that has at least three grams of fiber to curb cravings and up satiety levels. Plus, this complex carbohydrate conveniently comes with built-in blood sugar regulation&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and digestive health benefits&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Hippley also shares that “less added sugar means fewer energy crashes, fewer cravings, and a lower risk of inflammation&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and weight gain.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile Brown prioritizes low-ingredient sandwich breads. “Remember, you really only need a grain, water, salt, and sometimes yeast to make bread; anything else may be an unnecessary addition,” she explains. Most mystery ingredients—like additives, preservatives, and dyes—also lack the evidence needed to understand their long-term health benefits&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The healthiest bread is the bread that helps you reach your overall health goals,” adds Alexis Law, RDN, registered dietitian at Top Nutrition Coaching, explaining that some people might require a lower calorie count, while others may look to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/fibermaxxing-nutrition-trend-is-it-good-for-you-11733806" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;maximize their fiber intake&lt;/a&gt; or minimize sodium consumption with their bread choice. Aiming for sodium levels of less than 200 milligrams per serving is a great rule of thumb to avoid going overboard with this mineral, which can increase blood pressure&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; when over-consumed over long periods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-healthiest-sandwich-bread"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; The Healthiest Sandwich Bread &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to picking a bread MVP, these three dietitians agree that 100 percent whole wheat sprouted bread is the best sandwich bread choice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “100 percent whole wheat bread is a great option, because it will offer a high amount of nutrients (like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/vitamin-b-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals like iron, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-zinc-7511268" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-potassium-than-bananas-11753287" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/foods-high-in-magnesium" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, selenium, and phosphorus) and fiber. It contains all three grain layers—germ, bran, and endosperm—to boost fiber content compared to white bread,” explains Law. Plus, it also has a lower glycemic response&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; than &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/signs-bread-is-unhealthy-8778162" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;white bread&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in less extreme spikes and dips in blood sugar (and energy) levels. Whole grain intake (including breads) is associated with lower chronic disease risk&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, too!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the sprouted front, Brown shares that, “sprouted grains are at their peak nutritionally&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, so these breads are higher in protein, fiber, and omega-3s than typical white or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/cooking-tips-techniques/whole-wheat-whole-grain-breads-0" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;whole wheat breads&lt;/a&gt;.” This results in a more filling, nourishing bread that also helps to mitigate inflammation&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, sprouted breads tend to have a lower gluten content&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for those sensitive to the wheat protein, and are also often lower in the anti-nutrients&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; found in wheat products that can inhibit the absorption of certain minerals like iron.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This type of bread is also usually accessible and found in most stores—often offered by store brands to make them more affordable,” Law adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, it’s important to not be deceived by certain ‘wheat’ bread brands. “Surprisingly, many ‘wheat breads’ that seem healthy lack fiber and sneak in more added sugar than you'd expect,” shares Hipley. To avoid this, look for ‘100 percent’ or ‘whole’ on wheat breads, and be sure to double check the ingredients list.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Once you have your sprouted whole grain bread home, there are plenty of ways to make a delicious sandwich—and other recipes—with it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Law's go-to sandwiches include &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/tuna-salad-tartines-8419800" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;tuna salad&lt;/a&gt; or turkey and cucumber. “I love adding &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cucumber-health-benefits-7371080" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cucumber&lt;/a&gt; to a sandwich along with raw spinach to get a nice crunch and easily add more veggies to a meal,” she shares.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Brown also loves tuna (tuna melt with pickled onions, specifically!), nut butter and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/how-to-store-bananas" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;banana&lt;/a&gt;, and an ‘egg in a hole’ sandwich—though she has some ingenious uses for stale store-bought sandwich bread, too. “Don’t overlook stale bread; toast the crumbled crusts in a pan with herbs for homemade croutons or salad toppers,” she says.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, Hipley, also often whips up a tuna salad sando or homemade PB and J—but has some other tried and true recipes she adores, too. “&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cottage-cheese-health-benefits-7109196" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Cottage cheese&lt;/a&gt; topped with fresh garden tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil and smashed avocado with an egg or hemp or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/chia-seeds-vs-flax-seeds-11709668" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are also some of my favorites,” she adds.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the end of the day, a healthy sandwich bread can turn a fairly healthy lunch into something particularly nutritious—not the other way around, as bread is often unfairly vilified. “Bread itself is not to be feared, unless there is an allergy or intolerance, and it can be a great way to add fiber easily to the diet,” Law encourages.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the very healthiest store-bought option, try a sprouted whole wheat loaf. “Sprouted grain breads like Dave’s Killer Bread or Silver Hills are two of my top picks for healthy sandwich breads,” Brown shares. These loaves offer fiber, protein, B vitamins, minerals, and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthy-fats-8740244" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, arguably qualifying them as bona fide superfoods.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus, also known as the “stomach flu” or “winter vomiting sickness,” is active in California and across the nation. But cleaning and disinfecting can help check its spread, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Precautions are crucial because the virus is &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html"&gt;highly infectious&lt;/a&gt; and there’s no real treatment for it, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Aug. 1 through Nov. 13, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/php/reporting/norostat-data.html#:~:text=About%20the%20current%20norovirus%20season%20*%20During,same%20period%20during%20the%202012%2D2025%20seasonal%20years"&gt;153 norovirus outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; were reported in 14 states.

The state health department reviews data collected by WastewaterSCAN to check “overall trends in the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;What is norovirus? Is it the same as the flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus is a &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/data-research/index.html"&gt;“very contagious” disease&lt;/a&gt; that causes vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps, according to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus inflicts acute gastroenteritis — inflammation of the stomach or intestines — on people of all ages in the United States, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it’s often called the “stomach flu,” norovirus is not related to the flu, which comes from the influenza virus, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, there are about 2,500 reported norovirus outbreaks across the country, with surges most common from November to April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average each year, the highly contagious virus causes 109,000 hospitalizations, 465,000 emergency department visits and 19 million to 21 million illnesses, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus is the “leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea” and causes 58% of foodborne illnesses in the nation, the federal public health agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="12" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;How does the stomach bug spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus spreads easily from person to person, while infected individuals are experiencing symptoms, according to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically last one to three days, though someone can still be contagious up to two days after they feel better, according to the public health department’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus disseminates from a person’s vomit and stool, spraying into the air or landing on nearby surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="16" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can survive for weeks on unwashed objects, such as countertops, phones and doorknobs, the public health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can get sick after touching or caring for someone who is sick,” the department said, “or after touching or eating something that is contaminated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can spread very quickly in closed and crowded environments, including schools, child care centers, hospitals, nursing homes, jails and cruise ships, according to the state Public Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="19" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the most common ways to catch norovirus, according to federal and state health officials:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching, caring for or sharing food with a person infected with norovirus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating or drinking something that has norovirus in it, including undercooked shellfish like oysters&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth before washing your hands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sharing the toilet or bathroom with someone who is sick with norovirus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swallowing water that has norovirus in it, including water in swimming pools or other recreational areas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cleaning up vomit or diarrhea without wearing protective gear, such as gloves and a face mask.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“​Anyone can get norovirus, even if they’ve had it before,” the California Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="22" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;Do you need to disinfect after norovirus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you or someone in your household is sick with norovirus, it’s important to &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Norovirus.aspx"&gt;clean and disinfect areas&lt;/a&gt; where someone has vomited or had diarrhea,” the California Department of Public Health advised. “Cleaning with soap and water removes germs from surfaces, while disinfecting kills any remaining germs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use store-bought disinfectants to clean up after the stomach flu, but check the label to be sure it lists norovirus as one of the microorganisms it kills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also can check the federal Environmental Protection Agency registration and search for the number in the &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/epas-registered-antimicrobial-products-effective-against-norovirus-feline"&gt;EPA’s List G – Registered Antimicrobial Products Effective Against Norovirus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-110" class="zone zone-el" index="26" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also can &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/sites/default/files/resource/Norovirus-Cleaning-Tips.pdf"&gt;mix your own bleach solution&lt;/a&gt; to disinfect after norovirus, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. “Mix 5 to 25 tablespoons of household bleach in a gallon of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply this solution only to hard or nonporous surfaces with a spray bottle or disposable mop, sponge or paper towel, the department said. Let it sit about five minutes before wiping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Give extra attention to disinfecting things that are commonly touched in the home, such as doorknobs, remote controls and handles,” the USDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-111" class="zone zone-el" index="29" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware that many disinfectant wipes are not completely effective at killing norovirus, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;How do you clean up after norovirus?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wear &lt;a target="_blank" rel="Follow" href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/prevention/index.html"&gt;rubber or disposable gloves&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said. Wipe the entire area with paper towels and throw them in a plastic trash bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health also suggests wearing a face mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-112" class="zone zone-el" index="33" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After disinfecting, clean the entire area again with soap and water, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be aware the virus may be aerosolized when someone vomits, meaning surfaces several feet away could be contaminated, the USDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw away your gloves and mask when you’re done, the California Department of Public Health said. Then, take out the trash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-113" class="zone zone-el" index="36" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2"&gt;What about laundry?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using disposable gloves and a face mask, remove and wash all clothes and linens that may have vomit or poop on them,” the California Department of Public Health said. “Be careful to handle items without shaking them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wash the items with detergent and hot water at the longest laundry cycle, then dry them on high heat, the CDC said. Wash your hands with soap and water after handling infected clothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="embed-infographic"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-114" class="zone zone-el" index="40" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 does not just affect the respiratory system, but also significantly alters the brain in people who have fully recovered from the infectious disease, highlighting the long-term neurological impact of the virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Griffith University’s National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Disease (NCNED) used advanced MRI techniques to ascertain the neurological implications of COVID-19 compared with those who had never been infected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research provided compelling evidence that even in the absence of ongoing symptoms, prior infection with the virus could leave a measurable imprint on the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Dr Kiran Thapaliya, said: “We used multimodal MRI techniques to examine both grey and white matter brain regions critical for memory, cognition and overall brain health and found clear differences across all participant groups.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The unique MRI approach identified significant alterations in brain neurochemicals, brain signal intensity, and tissue structure not only in individuals with Long COVID but also in those who considered themselves fully recovered,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The research also reported that altered brain tissue was associated with symptom severity in individuals with Long COVID, suggesting the virus may leave a silent, lasting effect on brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings offer vital insights into how COVID 19 affects the central nervous system and may help explain the cognitive problems, such as memory and concentration, reported both shortly after infection and months or even years later.&lt;/p&gt;

During vigorous exercise, levels of the hormone precursor POMC attaching to EVs increase fourfold, suggesting a newly uncovered mechanism for how stress, energy balance, and mood may shift after movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EV-bound POMC also crosses blood vessel barriers, including the blood–brain barrier, more efficiently than POMC alone, offering insight into how exercise may influence brain function. The findings open new possibilities for understanding metabolism, pain, mental health, immune responses, and drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise Boosts POMC Transport:&lt;/strong&gt; Vigorous exercise causes a fourfold increase in POMC molecules hitching onto EVs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient Barrier Crossing:&lt;/strong&gt; EV-bound POMC crosses blood vessel barriers—including the blood–brain barrier—better than POMC alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wide Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; This mechanism may influence pain relief, stress, metabolism, inflammation, mental health, and future therapeutic delivery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Touro University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at Touro University Nevada have discovered that tiny particles in the blood, called extracellular vesicles (EVs), are a major player in how a group of hormones are shuttled through the body.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical exercise can stimulate this process. The findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS),&lt;/em&gt; open the door to deeper understanding of hormone circulation and access to the brain, how exercise may trigger changes in energy balance, mental health, and immune function, and circulation of certain drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood and other body fluids are teeming with EVs—tiny particles that exist outside of cells. EVs transmit signals from cell-to-cell within tissues and long distance across organ systems by delivering biological cargo such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids into cells. They also remove cell waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have known that EVs play key roles, from the immune response to cancer progression, but much less is known about how they might interact with hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on a hormone precursor called proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which transforms into a range of hormones including endorphins (responsible for the runner’s high) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which manages the body’s stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because exercise has been previously associated with these hormones, the researchers used exercise to provoke changes to shed light on interactions between POMC and EVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that vigorous exercise causes four times more POMC to hitch a ride on the EVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study doesn’t just show an ‘exercise effect’ but it reveals a new biological mechanism where stress from exercise makes EVs temporarily act as hormone transport shuttles in the bloodstream,” explains  the study’s first author Mark Santos, Ph.D., assistant professor at Touro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that in the lab, EV-bound POMC can cross human blood vessel barriers, including the blood-brain barrier, more efficiently than POMC alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since POMC must be processed into so-called “mature” hormones to initiate a response in the notoriously difficult-to-access brain, more work is required to understand how the exercise-induced rise in POMC affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The observation that EVs can carry POMC has so many potential directions, says Aurelio Lorico, MD, PhD, professor of pathology at Touro and co-senior author on the study together with Cheryl Hightower. It may have wide-ranging implications, for pain management, metabolism and obesity, inflammation, and the stress response,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765835329347"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What did researchers discover about hormones and exercise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: They found that exercise causes EVs to act as transport shuttles, greatly increasing how much POMC they carry through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765835330979"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why does EV-bound POMC matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: When attached to EVs, POMC crosses biological barriers more efficiently, suggesting a potential pathway for influencing brain function and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1765835330363"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How might this impact future medicine or therapies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: EV-based hormone transport could inform new strategies for treating pain, metabolic disorders, stress-related conditions, and for designing drugs that better reach the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a8cdc4c1dbc0cddec986dbcbc0c4c9c5e8dcc7dddac786cdccdd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ellie Schlam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://touro.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Touro University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ellie Schlam – Touro University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 22:05:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE0xNlNqMm9NaVlKazF2cjhKbEFXeDE1WWI3enNLblJkV24zQ3hwVC1nVDFmLTdua0RSQU1hZUlpNUtHdzJvdkZtYm50d2JVeW8xa2tFUk5najRIbndEU3FKTnhVZEwxQnpQQWNHazJzaHFBY3k2</guid></item><item><title>关于爆红的 2-2-2 健身法，哪些是好哪些是坏？——Lifehacker</title><link>https://lifehacker.com/health/whats-good-and-overhyped-about-the-2-2-2-workout</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="editor-content" data-autopogo&gt;
        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; If I’ve learned anything about online fitness content in the years I've spent consuming and creating it, it’s this: Stack a bunch of numbers together, and you have a potentially viral workout, from &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/pros-and-cons-of-the-12-3-30-workout" target="_blank"&gt;12-3-30&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://zifftech.slack.com/archives/C04UF6QH54L/p1765836231728109?thread_ts=1765833568.765119&amp;amp;cid=C04UF6QH54L" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;4-2-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest is the 2-2-2 workout, which is supposed to reveal the big secret of effectively building muscle after you hit age 40. Unfortunately, after trying it out, I’m not so sure about that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-the-internet-says-about-the-2-2-2-workout"&gt;What the Internet says about the 2-2-2 workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been seeing the 2-2-2 workout pop up across the Internet, but all the sources point back to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7ma-hb9nHE" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from Alain Gonzalez that claims the “2-workout-2-set” method is “getting men over 40 jacked FAST.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s pretty much the whole pitch: The number 2 comes up twice (I felt like I was going mad trying to find out what the last 2 is for), and it’s aimed at middle-aged men. I’m not a man, but as a middle-aged woman with personal training and weightlifting coaching certifications, I’m in a pretty good positions to evaluate those claims. So let’s take a look at what’s actually in the workouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-2-2-2-stands-for"&gt;What 2-2-2 stands for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the PDF Gonzalez offers that describes the program, and in it he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; actually say what the many articles about his method did not: what the third “2” stands for. So, the 2-2-2 method is: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two full-body workouts per week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two working sets per exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two reps in reserve on each set&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a fine setup, I think, and probably a lot of people of any gender or age would get stronger using a workout like this. But it also relies on two often misunderstood concepts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-working-sets"&gt;What are “working sets”? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A working set is a set of an exercise that you think of as your “real” work for the day. This means that it &lt;em&gt;does not include&lt;/em&gt; warmup sets, or anything else you do to prepare for those working sets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you might end up doing more than two sets, depending on the exercise. For example, I may not need any warmup sets to do my cable lateral raises (one of the exercises Gonzalez recommends), so that’s just two actual sets. But if I’m supposed to do two hard sets of leg press, I’m not going to leg press a couple hundred pounds cold. I’d start with sets of lighter weights and work my way up—so maybe that will be five sets total for the day, but only the working sets count for the 2-2-2 program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that the PDF calls for seven exercises each day. That’s a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; of 14 sets you’ll do per workout, with most exercises likely requiring at least one or two warmup sets, and some even more. You’ll also rest two to five minutes between sets. Emphasizing “just two sets” makes the workout sound quick and simple, but in practice, it looks like you’ll probably be in the gym a good while. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-reps-in-reserve"&gt;What are “reps in reserve”?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reps in reserve, or RIR, is a great way to explain to &lt;em&gt;experienced&lt;/em&gt; lifters how hard they’ll be working in a given set. If you’ve never used RIR before, though, there is a definite learning curve. The idea is that you stop an exercise with two reps “in reserve”—that is, reps that you could have done but didn’t. If you’ve done 10 lat pulldowns and you feel like the eleventh would be really hard and the twelfth would be the last one you could possibly do in this set, then you stop at 10. You’ve left those last two reps “in reserve.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a common, useful way of talking about exercise intensity—see this explainer from the &lt;a href="https://blog.nasm.org/reps-in-reserve" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Academy of Sports Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But you have to have enough experience with that exercise, and with exercising in general, to recognize the signs your body gives you that you have exactly two reps left. Often, beginners will stop too early, and never get the benefits of going closer to failure before stopping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re used to using RIR (or RPE, which is a similar concept), this is a fine way of planning your workouts. If you tend to overestimate your abilities, you’ll probably hit RIR 0 (that is, failure) often enough to teach yourself what those last few reps feel like. But if you’re a person who tends to shy away from those harder reps, or if you’ve never &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; gone all the way to failure on an exercise, RIR is probably not a good tool for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-data="{

&lt;h2 id="whats-good-about-the-2-2-2-workout"&gt;What’s good about the 2-2-2 workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a lifter and a trainer, I like the idea of 2-2-2...for a specific kind of person. And yes, probably a lot of the “men over 40” in the target audience qualify as that person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, this is a good workout for people who are already experienced in the gym, but can’t reliably make time for more than two workouts per week. You can get a lot done in two workouts, if each workout covers all your major muscle groups, which it does in this plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The routine does have a plan for progression, which is nice—a lot of trendy workout routines do not. You’ll be doing “double progression,” which means you increase reps of an exercise until you feel ready to increase the weight. At that point you’ll be doing fewer reps, so you start adding reps again. That’s a solid approach that doesn’t take much thinking ahead. (It’s also a missed opportunity to add another “2” to the name.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-overhyped-or-misunderstood-about-the-2-2-2-workout"&gt;What’s overhyped (or misunderstood) about the 2-2-2 workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My biggest gripe about this workout is just that there’s nothing special about it. It’s basic to the point of being almost common sense: Hey you, do two full-body workouts a week! Make sure each exercise has a few hard sets! Really, no need to overthink it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s actually nothing special here for “men over 40,” except perhaps that men over 40 are more likely to have kids and other responsibilities taking up their time, and thus will find a twice-a-week schedule convenient. I also find the workout selection biased toward people who stick to machines. On the bright side, you could probably do this whole thing at a Planet Fitness, and that's going to be convenient for a lot of folks. But I find machines boring. (Maybe that's a "me" problem.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of Gonzalez’s actual workout materials, there are a few things that bug me. One is that he talks about the two-workouts-per-week schedule as if it were strongly supported by science as the best option. In reality, two workouts are &lt;em&gt;fine,&lt;/em&gt; but people tend to do better with more. No champion bodybuilder or weightlifter hits every muscle twice a week and chills on the couch the rest of the time. Even most recreational athletes with some kind of goal will do better with three or four workouts. Two is enough for most people’s goals, but it’s not necessarily &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promising more results for less work is a staple of the fitness industry, so I’m able to see through it—and of course &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; says their signature workout is the best option. But if you going in thinking the 2-2-2 really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the secret to getting jacked over 40, I beg you to consider that there is &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; one correct answer to fitness. You can pick any schedule that works each major muscle twice per week, and it will accomplish the same trick. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As long as this dangerous material remains available and is purchased and used in California, it’s inevitable that people will continue to be exposed and die,” Robert Blink, an occupational medicine doctor in San Francisco and former WOEMA president, told KQED. “There’s always resistance to change. But when you’ve got something this dangerous out there that’s literally killing people … we’ve got to stop this from going up. This is not a time for small measures, frankly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineered stone can contain more than 90% crystalline silica, much more than natural stones such as marble. The factory-made material’s popularity has skyrocketed because it is stain-resistant, produced in attractive colors and designs and is often cheaper than natural stones. But many consumers are unaware of the hazards that artificial stone dust poses to the workers who shape and install their countertops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing scientific evidence has shown that the silica dust released by the material is so toxic that small amounts of exposure are enough to make workers sick. The tiny airborne particles can penetrate filter masks and lodge in the lungs, causing progressive scarring and injury in workers, some as young as their 20s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of silicosis cases have also been reported by doctors in Illinois, Utah, Colorado, Massachusetts, as well as other states that are not tracking the disease as systematically as California’s public health authorities. Those figures are widely believed to be underreported. Israel, Spain and other countries have also seen a surge in silicosis tied to engineered stone. Medical experts in the UK are urging authorities to prohibit the use of the material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Nevin, an attorney at Brayton Purcell, a firm that represents hundreds of sick workers suing major manufacturers and distributors of artificial stone, said clients are located in 16 other states, including New York, Nevada, Florida, Kentucky and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

Inhaling fine particles can contribute to silicosis. &lt;cite&gt;(Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California currently bans the dry cutting of engineered stone and mandates the use of wet methods — machines that submerge or cover the material’s surface with water to suppress dust. Employers are also required to implement local exhaust ventilation, ensure employees wear powered air-purifying respirators and take other measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cal/OSHA inspectors have found most of the 120 shops they’ve visited in the last two years were violating the rules, which fabricators and doctors consider too expensive and challenging for many employers to follow. California has about 4,600 countertop fabrication workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major manufacturers, such as Israel-based Caesarstone, did not immediately return requests for comment on the California ban proposal, but publicly opposed a prohibition in Australia. A spokesperson for Cosentino, a company headquartered in Spain, also declined to comment, but told KQED last month that silicosis is preventable when proper safety and health measures are in place to protect workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both companies, which face hundreds of lawsuits by workers claiming silica-related injuries in the U.S. and other countries, have developed crystalline silica-free products for the Australian market but continue to sell high-silica engineered stone in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KQED</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 21:16:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxNcjZFN3RMbk5hTFVGUGJSb2tEdG02RDZmMDRJbm42dXg2VGtEX29TU0NQWVJHRnZJQ1dUWVB4elFaYms3d3VtdHh4SWpUNGRzdnhzYmxPTWxVb2ZaYWg2SnpwTDlFOFJVUE45aU9SbmljRUd2VUE2STlxcnhnb2NoWXoyM0lnLTg1Rzl4czlCUDVTZjBfN0JKa1JESXJ2czRpTnRvdm11VVl6YmdQZmZNQzJTUTE4T0E5cVprN2xIOEx5RzVKdHc</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，将血糖降低心脏病风险控制在一半-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/15/well/blood-sugar-heart-disease-risk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 20:41:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxQVHZ5c0swVjd3RGY1MjA4WXRQTHhOYkFqMkkwMm5nWTBUVHV5aFRuQ3ROcTJDeUFMZzM1Z3R6QmcwRS1NcXMySm9LT1JybXVwRl82dTUtclAxTGNyNXVubVIzUEhuN3ZoT1g4bEpjQjFKRHFXUW1Ja1hDaTlNMHBBVQ</guid></item><item><title>发现可控制胆固醇和心脏病风险的小RNA分子- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-12-small-rna-molecule-cholesterol-heart.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. health officials have expanded approval of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-industry-links-run-deep-in-field-of-sexual-medicine-2f6bd9d5ed5e4d26aa50d4dfe2cb25c6"&gt;a much-debated drug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; aimed at &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-3b04306fd1da48b2bb5d1c56db2ea175"&gt;boosting female libido&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug’s use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/general-news-7779b97e8bbc44e08827013e528dc1f9"&gt;Addyi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-industry-links-run-deep-in-field-of-sexual-medicine-2f6bd9d5ed5e4d26aa50d4dfe2cb25c6"&gt;low sex drive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addyi, marketed by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/drug-execs-behind-female-libido-pill-have-run-afoul-of-fda-c6bc3317da92422b967fa6ddb8ff73aa"&gt;Sprout Pharmaceuticals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women’s health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street’s initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval “reflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women’s sexual health is understood and prioritized.” The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis is not universally accepted, and some psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug’s modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women’s rights issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story has been updated to correct the age range of the FDA approval update. The agency approved the drug for postmenopausal women up to age 65, not older than 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hallmarks-of-aging-framework-has-a-major-problem-that-nobody-talked-about-until-now"&gt;The ‘Hallmarks of Aging’ Framework Has A Major Problem That Nobody Talked About Until Now&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-octonary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody dies of “old age”&lt;/strong&gt;: Autopsy studies across species reveal that specific diseases (heart disease in humans, cancer in mice, intestinal failure in flies) kill us, not some generalized aging process. Even healthy centenarians die from identifiable organ failures, never from aging alone.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “hallmarks of aging” may not slow aging&lt;/strong&gt;: Between 57-100% of studies supporting aging’s most influential framework only tested interventions in old animals. When studies included young animals, 72% of traits showed the same improvements in both age groups, suggesting these interventions boost general health rather than slow aging itself.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Longevity drugs might just delay specific diseases&lt;/strong&gt;: Rapamycin and intermittent fasting extend mouse lifespan primarily by postponing cancer deaths, not by fundamentally slowing aging. It’s more snooze button than reset button, and since humans die mainly from heart disease, mouse cancer-prevention strategies may not translate.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DNA age tests measure correlation, not causation&lt;/strong&gt;: Biological age clocks predict health outcomes well but don’t reveal what actually drives aging. A 2024 study found these clocks aren’t enriched for sites with causal roles in aging, they’re more like reading wrinkles to guess age than understanding why we age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next time a death certificate lists “natural causes” or a doctor mentions someone died of “old age,” keep in mind that may not be true after all. Autopsy studies reveal that even centenarians who seemed healthy days before death succumbed to specific, identifiable diseases, not some vague process called aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists Maryam Keshavarz and Dan Ehninger from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases argue in a new review that this fundamental misunderstanding has led aging research astray for decades. Their systematic analysis, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.61373/gp025i.0119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Genomic Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that much of what scientists thought they knew about measuring and manipulating aging may be built on flawed assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined 2,410 autopsies, cardiovascular disease emerged as the culprit in the vast majority of deaths, including myocardial infarction (heart attacks, 39%), cardiopulmonary failure (38%), and cerebrovascular lesions (&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/inflammatory-bowel-disease-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;strokes&lt;/a&gt;, 17.9%). A study of people over 85 who died unexpectedly outside hospitals found cardiovascular events responsible for 77% of deaths. Even among centenarians perceived as healthy, autopsies revealed that 68% died from cardiovascular causes, 25% from respiratory failure, and smaller percentages from other specific organ failures. Zero died from “old age.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Autopsy analyses are crucial for correcting misperceptions, the researchers write, noting that relatives and even physicians frequently misjudge &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/covid-spouse-deaths-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;causes of death &lt;/a&gt;without examining the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-each-species-dies-differently"&gt;Why Each Species Dies Differently&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pattern of disease-driven mortality extends across the animal kingdom, but with a crucial twist: each species has its own vulnerable spot. While &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cardiovascular-disease-2060/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; dominates in humans and nonhuman primates, causing over 60% of deaths in aging rhesus macaques, rodents tell an entirely different story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer killed between 84% and 89% of mice in one major study under normal feeding conditions. Dietary restriction reduced this to 64% in both sexes, while rapamycin treatment lowered it to 74%. Even with interventions widely considered to slow aging, cancer remained the primary cause of death in mice, just occurring at later ages. In rats, tumors accounted for roughly 63% of deaths. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/genetic-link-between-dogs-and-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dogs&lt;/a&gt; showed a similar pattern, with neoplasia causing nearly half of all deaths in older animals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Move further down the evolutionary tree and the causes shift again. Fruit flies die primarily from intestinal epithelial failure, a breakdown of the gut lining that leads to bacterial infections. Roundworms succumb to pharyngeal infections or throat muscle atrophy. Each species has a different &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/cancer-achilles-heel-discovered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Achilles’ heel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This creates a problem for aging research. When a drug extends mouse lifespan by preventing cancer, has it slowed aging or merely delayed one particular disease? And if &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/neandertthals-died-because-less-creative-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;humans die&lt;/a&gt; primarily from cardiovascular problems rather than cancer, why should we expect mouse cancer-prevention strategies to help us live longer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-influential-framework-built-on-questionable-evidence"&gt;The Influential Framework Built on Questionable Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concerns grow when Keshavarz and Ehninger turn their attention to one of aging research’s most influential concepts: the “hallmarks of aging.” Introduced in 2013 as nine hallmarks and expanded to 12 in a 2023 update, this framework identifies cellular and molecular changes (from genomic instability to cellular senescence to mitochondrial dysfunction) that supposedly drive the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The hallmarks papers have been cited thousands of times and shaped research priorities across the field. Yet when the researchers systematically examined the evidence supporting each hallmark’s causal role in aging, they uncovered a widespread methodological flaw.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 57% and 100% of the studies supporting different hallmarks tested interventions only in old animals. This design makes it impossible to tell whether treatments &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/can-vitamin-d-supplements-really-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genuinely slow aging &lt;/a&gt;or simply improve function at any age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The distinction is critical. Imagine a drug that enhances memory equally in both young and old mice. That’s valuable, but it’s not evidence the drug slows cognitive aging. It just means the drug&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/choir-singing-improves-brain-function-slows-cognitive-decline-older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; improves brain function&lt;/a&gt; generally. To claim an intervention slows aging, researchers need to show it changes the rate at which age-dependent decline occurs, not just shifts everyone’s performance upward.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Keshavarz and Ehninger identified studies that did include young animals, they analyzed 602 age-sensitive traits across those studies. They found that 436 of these traits (72%) showed effects in both young and old age groups. The interventions were producing what the researchers call baseline effects (age-independent physiological changes) rather than genuine alterations to aging trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/button&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Main causes of death in selected animals: highlighting the role of pathology in limiting lifespan. This figure illustrates leading causes of death across different species, emphasizing that lifespan is often limited by specific pathologies rather than a generalized decline in physiological function. In humans,&lt;br&gt;nonhuman primates, rodents, and dogs, age-related mortality is predominantly driven by identifiable diseases, most notably cardiovascular conditions and neoplasia, suggesting that lifespan is largely shaped by a limited set of age-related pathologies.

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-rapamycin-and-fasting-studies-actually-show"&gt;What Rapamycin and Fasting Studies Actually Show&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The issue extends even to aging research’s success stories. Rapamycin consistently extends lifespan in mice and has become one of the field’s most studied compounds. Intermittent fasting reliably prolongs life in rodents. Genetic manipulations that reduce growth hormone signaling add months to mouse lifespans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet deep phenotyping studies that measured dozens of age-sensitive traits revealed something unexpected. Most effects of these interventions appeared as baseline shifts rather than changes in aging rate. Mice showed similar improvements whether treated young (before age-related changes emerged) or old (after such changes had manifested).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2022 study by Xie and colleagues examined three major longevity interventions across 180 age-sensitive traits in mice. They found that 145 traits (roughly 81%) showed intervention effects in young animals equal to or greater than those in old animals. The interventions were altering physiology broadly, not specifically targeting the processes that drive age-dependent change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rapamycin-treated mice still died primarily from &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, just at older ages. Intermittent fasting didn’t eliminate the diseases of aging—it postponed them. The interventions worked more like hitting a snooze button on mortality than fundamentally rewinding the aging clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dna-age-tests-may-not-measure-what-you-think"&gt;DNA Age Tests May Not Measure What You Think&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problems extend to tools that have become wildly popular both in research and consumer markets: biological age clocks. These algorithms, particularly those based on DNA methylation patterns (chemical modifications to DNA), can predict chronological age with impressive accuracy and have spawned a cottage industry of longevity testing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Keshavarz and Ehninger argue these clocks share a fundamental limitation with much of aging research. They’re correlational tools that identify patterns associated with age without revealing causal mechanisms. The comparison to facial aging is apt: &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/wrinkles-heart-diseaes-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wrinkles predict age&lt;/a&gt; reliably, but treating wrinkles doesn’t make you biologically younger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/sprint-speed-declines-before-stamina/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt; clocks rely on a surprisingly small number of genomic sites. Studies show they maintain accuracy even when many sites are removed, suggesting the remaining sites capture redundant information rather than providing comprehensive biological insight. A 2024 study using Mendelian randomization (a technique that can help distinguish correlation from causation) found that traditional aging clocks aren’t significantly enriched for sites with causal roles in aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The clocks remain useful for predicting health outcomes and stratifying people by risk. But they may not tell researchers whether an intervention truly slows biological aging or just shifts biomarker values in age-independent ways.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-aging-research-needs-to-change"&gt;What Aging Research Needs to Change&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keshavarz and Ehninger don’t argue that aging research has been worthless. The field has identified numerous interventions that extend lifespan in model organisms and accumulated vast amounts of data about age-related changes. The problem is interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A drug that prevents cancer in mice is valuable even if it doesn’t slow aging per se. A biomarker that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/aging-clock-predicts-disease-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;predicts mortality risk &lt;/a&gt;helps even if it doesn’t reveal aging mechanisms. But claiming these as evidence of understanding or manipulating aging itself requires more rigorous proof.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers propose concrete refinements. Studies should measure diverse outcomes across multiple organ systems rather than relying on lifespan or a handful of favorite biomarkers. Interventions should be tested in both young and old subjects to distinguish rate effects from baseline effects. Researchers should explicitly acknowledge species-specific life-limiting pathologies rather than assuming mouse results translate directly to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most provocatively, they suggest the field needs to confront an uncomfortable possibility: despite decades of research and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thousands of papers on aging&lt;/a&gt;, scientists may still lack a deep mechanistic understanding of what drives age-dependent decline. They’ve catalogued correlates of aging, identified factors that extend lifespan by postponing specific diseases, and developed predictive biomarkers. But understanding the underlying process that makes organisms more vulnerable over time may remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This matters beyond academic debates. As longevity interventions move from mice to humans, the distinction between preventing specific diseases and genuinely slowing aging determines which treatments to pursue, how to test them, and what outcomes to measure. Getting it wrong &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/food-waste-problem-america/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;wastes resources&lt;/a&gt; and, more importantly, delays finding interventions that might actually work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aging research aims to identify the underlying drivers of biological changes across different levels, the authors write. But first, the field needs to ensure its tools and concepts actually measure what researchers think they’re measuring. Otherwise, aging science risks building an increasingly elaborate structure on a foundation that was never as solid as it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review acknowledges that implementing its proposed refinements would require substantially larger, more complex, and more expensive studies. Distinguishing rate effects from baseline effects demands careful experimental design including both young and old treatment groups, which many researchers may lack resources to include. The analysis of “hallmarks of aging” evidence is based on studies cited in the 2023 López-Otín et al. review, which may not capture all relevant research in the field. The authors also note that while they identify widespread methodological issues, correlation-based tools still provide value for risk stratification and longitudinal tracking, even if they don’t reveal underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

While he hasn’t officially retired from farmwork, he can’t do most of the day-to-day labor required to maintain the farm.

He could calculate large numbers in his head easily. But Parkinson’s has dulled his mental acuity.
