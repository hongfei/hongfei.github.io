  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp2os000o3b79gikeuv1x@published"&gt;Over the past year, I’ve purposefully lost a lot of weight. I did it mostly for health reasons (I was borderline diabetic, and have now reversed it, which is great), but I would be lying if there wasn’t some aesthetic desired mixed up in all of this as well. I love how I look now—except for one big problem.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjq0vvo000d3b79hy5aq81f@published"&gt;I have so much loose skin on my arms and my boobs! My boobs are completely deflated. So I like how I look in clothes but hate how I look naked—and am especially insecure now as I meet men for hookups and flings. I don’t think I need to warn them, but I feel like they must notice. I can’t help but think my body is a huge turnoff once the clothes come off. Where do I go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp2yp000s3b79dzj8mocw@published"&gt;Patience, combined with the kind of lifestyle that helps reduce the risk of diabetes, might help you more than you think. Your skin might become less loose over time (&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/loose-skin-after-weight-loss"&gt;putting on some muscle&lt;/a&gt; can help), and you may find you start to care less. If you’re still dissatisfied in another year, a dermatologist or plastic surgeon can offer you several options. But I suggest you give yourself some time to see what changes in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp30h000t3b796xjqfs5x@published"&gt;It’s important to know &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2500v087xo"&gt;that you aren’t alone&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure there’s something to be said for the power of knowing other people are having the same insecurities. But I bring this up to point out that because your experience isn’t super uncommon, the men you’re having flings with have probably encountered other naked women with similar skin. There absolutely are people in the world who will zero in on the physical details their partners are uncomfortable with, and some will even point those details out verbally, but those people are pretty rare. Anecdotally speaking, the men who are actually having a lot of hookups with multiple partners tend to be focused on the pleasure they’re experiencing and giving, or if anything, a bit concerned about their own characteristics they wish they could change. And, as strange as this may sound, straight men often appreciate or even fetishize certain appearance aspects that most women criticize about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp32g000u3b79e59kd72u@published"&gt;That said, I think it’s OK to lean on a band-aid style mitigation strategy, or at least have it as an option, and I’m an enthusiastic proponent of dressing for success. At all price points and in almost every imaginable aesthetic, there are bras that provide great support with sheer fabrics, bras that leave your nipples accessible, and bolero-style tops that cover only the shoulders and arms. Your best course of action will be to visit a few shops in person, as it’s infinitely more difficult to find the right fit for lingerie than it is for shirts or pants. If that’s not possible, lurking &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/16kygsb/good_bras_for_saggy_breasts_after_extensive/"&gt;the ABraThatFits subreddit&lt;/a&gt; can help you get an idea of what brands and styles might work for you, and the community is often happy to help posters who are willing to share their measurements. In the event that you get lucky and find a plethora of options that appeal to you, though, be choosy, as—to reiterate—your body might continue to change pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp34t000v3b798ielhdis@published"&gt;If you were looking for more of a long-term relationship, I’d be a bit more focused on encouraging you to look for people who feel supportive and accepting so you could be fully vulnerable with them. But hookup culture is accurately critiqued as being fairly superficial and usually too fast-paced for establishing that kind of trust. So, know that you can always leave the lights low, and—if a partner is having erectile difficulties—stay open to the likelihood that it has absolutely nothing to do with you, much less your body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjntand002g3b794wnrwqlx@published"&gt;I’m a 33-year-old man. I realized/admitted to myself that I was bi after I first started dating my now-wife (also 33) seven years ago. We took a break early in our relationship for about a year because of unrelated life events, but because of the circumstances, I wasn’t really able to explore my newly realized sexuality. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/02/cheating-grindr-messages-husband-advice.html"&gt;I only hooked up with one guy during that period and it wasn’t super great, honestly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dana Ellis Hunnes, a senior clinical dietitian at UCLA Health, says her local grocery store often stocks more non-dairy milk options than dairy ones. She’s tried various options, including a brief phase with coconut milk (“It was too creamy and too watery at the same time”). Now, she enjoys &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/19/oat-milk-rises-to-top-as-britains-preferred-plant-based-drink" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;oat milk&lt;/a&gt;, which adds the right amount of creaminess to her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The best choice depends on individual needs and preferences, says Hunnes. One person might want to add more protein to their diet, while another might be looking to increase their calcium intake. Flavor and mouthfeel are also important considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While dairy milk remains the most popular option in the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/402717/cow-milk-increase-america-dairy-plant-milks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/01/full-fat-milk-sales-rise-uk-shoppers-leave-low-calorie-options" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, alternatives are here to stay.

The study, which examined 219 plant-based milk alternatives from 21 brands, found that these alternatives were generally lower in protein and saturated fatty acids than dairy milk. Nutrients are often added to help alternative milks compete with dairy milk; 70% of the products were fortified with calcium and vitamin D, and other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows alternative milks are sometimes also fortified with vitamins A and B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3a239e7b-b6c6-43d9-b507-7a5723d9eba0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Checking the label is important when determining which product is right for you. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: SolStock/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adults likely don’t need to choose an alternative milk that matches dairy milk’s nutrient profile exactly, because they get those nutrients from other parts of their diet – unless they are especially concerned about their calcium intake, explains Dr Joan Sabate, a professor and executive director of the Center for Nutrition, Lifestyle and Disease Prevention at Loma Linda University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Checking the label is important when determining which product is right for you. The study found that the nutrient content of alternative milks varied. For instance, soy milk brands can contain different amounts of protein. “You can’t just pick a plant-based milk off the shelf and assume it’s going to meet your calcium needs,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hunnes does “strongly recommend that people try to go for the unsweetened varieties” to minimize their sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If someone is trying to get more protein, but with as minimal amount of sugar as possible, I might suggest they go for unsweetened pea protein milk or unsweetened soy milk,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For most people, alternative milks will only make up a small part of their overall diet, says Hunnes. With that in mind, these milks “won’t make or break someone’s healthfulness”, says Hunnes. “People should focus on what kind they like best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-alternative-milks-contain-seed-oils" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Do alternative milks contain seed oils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because many alternative milks lack fat, manufacturers may add seed oil to give the liquids a smooth taste and consistency. Seed oils may also be used as emulsifiers to prevent ingredient separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Experts say&lt;/a&gt; research does not support claims that seed oils are toxic or drive chronic disease. But claims like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/nx-s1-5453769/nutrition-canola-rfk-seed-oils-soybean" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Maha figurehead&lt;/a&gt; Robert F Kennedy Jr’s – that Americans are “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/13/robert-f-kennedy-jr-claims-seed-oils-are-poisoning-us-heres-why-hes-wrong" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unknowingly poisoned&lt;/a&gt;” by these products – have led some consumers to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fcb98fd8-99ee-48ba-b445-e7154eefa4cd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"RFK Jr says they are poisoning us, influencers call them unnatural – but what is the truth about seed oils?","elementId":"fcb98fd8-99ee-48ba-b445-e7154eefa4cd","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/29/rfk-jr-says-they-are-poisoning-us-influencers-call-them-unnatural-but-what-is-the-truth-about-seed-oils"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some seed oils can be pro-inflammatory if consumed in very high amounts, explains Hunnes, but the amount of seed oil in some alternative milks isn’t enough to warrant concern, since people are likely to consume only half to a full cup daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unless people are drinking a half a gallon of these non-dairy milks a day, it’s not something I would be concerned about,” says Hunnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research also suggests plant-derived oils may mitigate cardiovascular disease risk factors, says Johnson. “There’s not necessarily anything wrong with wanting to avoid seed oils and emulsifiers, but some perceived risks might not be accurate,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies generally show that these oils are associated with lower mortality than butter, and experts have &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-behind-seed-oils-health-effects" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that the purported adverse effects of seed oils have been conflated with the unhealthy foods they are sometimes used in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-each-alternative-milk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the pros and cons of each alternative milk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Johnson’s study found that soy-based products were most nutritionally similar to dairy milk. This is why Sabate recommends soy milk over other alternatives for children. It is also so similar to dairy milk in that it is the only alternative &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/milk-and-plant-based-milk-alternatives-know-nutrient-difference" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; in the dairy section of the US dietary guidelines for Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Soy also has various beneficial, naturally occurring &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772502222001068" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chemical compounds&lt;/a&gt;, says Sabate. These can support heart, kidney and liver health, she says. These include isoflavones, which are structurally similar to estrogen. This similarity may be why soy milk is linked to a lower &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/does-eating-soy-increase-estrogen-and-cause-breast" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2021/10000/the_women_s_study_for_the_alleviation_of_vasomotor.12.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reduced hot flashes&lt;/a&gt; (although the evidence is mixed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This similarity has led to a false assumption that drinking soy milk could have feminizing effects on men, despite &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20378106/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19524224/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showing that’s not true. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890623820302926" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; of 38 clinical studies found no adverse effects of soy on men. In one extremely &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9593161/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare case&lt;/a&gt;, in which a man’s breasts grew after drinking soy milk, he was consuming 1.2 liters of daily for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to a 2022 UC Davis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2025.2450263#abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, it is the most popular alternative after almond milk, and demand is growing. This may be because oat milk’s sensory qualities are similar to dairy milk; oat milk also often &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contains more sugar&lt;/a&gt; than almond, soy, pea and coconut milks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also contains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;phytates&lt;/a&gt;, compounds with antioxidant properties that can help prevent bone loss and kidney stone formation. Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128169384000033" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that oat milk may be an appropriate dairy substitute for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Oat milk also has &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more fiber&lt;/a&gt; than many alternative milks, except for rice milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Phytates can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534225/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;impair&lt;/a&gt; the absorption of iron, zinc and calcium; however, consuming oat milk along with a balanced, nutrient-rich diet should minimize any adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"7275ee59-782e-4b79-8ed8-715a8a11204f","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="7275ee59-782e-4b79-8ed8-715a8a11204f" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almond milk: &lt;/strong&gt;Those looking for something low-calorie or who are concerned about their blood sugar might want to try unsweetened almond milk, says Hunnes. It might also appeal to consumers who prioritize foods with fewer ingredients; there’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creqge8xgx4o" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising interest&lt;/a&gt; in simpler ingredient lists, so consumers can better understand the health impacts of a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That said, 2023 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that almond milk has less protein than cashew, hemp, pea and soy milk. It has more protein than coconut and rice milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Production of almond milk also involves more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;water use&lt;/a&gt; than other plant-based milks – though dairy production still uses significantly more water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut milk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Coconut milk has high levels of saturated fat, and is thus often marketed as having a mouthfeel similar to whole milk, explains Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="42941aca-a35c-44f5-b88e-a8e8e21fff10" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;There’s some evidence that coconut milk contains antioxidative compounds.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: jayk7/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critically, the American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; limiting saturated fats to less than 6 % of your total calories, so experts &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/the-great-milk-debate-of-2024-which-milk-is-healthier" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More research on coconut milk is needed to understand its health effects. But there is some evidence that it contains antioxidative &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7422486/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; that protect against DNA oxidative damage, which is linked to ageing-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Rice milk is made from milled rice and water, and is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/rice-milk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;often fortified&lt;/a&gt; with calcium and vitamin D. Because it is very low in protein – one &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;serving&lt;/a&gt; may contain 0.9 grams of protein, compared with 2.4 grams in oat milk and 1.7 grams in almond milk – experts recommend combining it with other protein-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rice milk may appeal to some because it’s low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996919308580" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;least allergenic&lt;/a&gt; of milk alternatives. It’s sometimes the choice of athletes and others with high energy needs because it contains &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/cow%E2%80%99s-milk-vs-the-alternatives-which-is-best" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All rice can &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.70008" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;potentially&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18385862/#:~:text=Abstract,food%20regulations%20in%20this%20respect." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contain arsenic&lt;/a&gt; because rice plants absorb the element from the soil. There are no dietary limits for arsenic in rice milk, but some reports &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2F1MDzyW55pg97Tdpp7gqLN/should-i-be-concerned-about-arsenic-in-my-rice" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advise caution&lt;/a&gt; around intake for children. Because young children eat three times more food for their size than adults do, they are more likely to take in higher amounts of inorganic arsenic from their diet. For instance, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/arsenic.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that infant rice cereals not contain more than 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s a need for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4779445/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more research&lt;/a&gt; to know the health effects of consuming arsenic via rice milk, though exposure is likely very low unless you’re drinking a lot of rice milk. People &lt;a href="https://hhs.iowa.gov/health-prevention/providers-professionals/center-acute-disease-epidemiology/epi-manual/environmental-disease/arsenic-poisoning" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consume&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 5 to 25 micrograms of arsenic daily as part of their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blended milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Blended milks are relatively new and need further study. One 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224423003837#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; suggests blended milks have a more similar mouthfeel to dairy milk than non-blended alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some alternative milk products combine various plant protein sources, and may be fortified with calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you want a product with a higher protein content, opt for soy or pea, which naturally contain protein, or blended products with those ingredients, says Johnson. Pea milk, for example, may have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;7 grams&lt;/a&gt; more protein per one-cup serving than almond milk, and also naturally contains vitamin A.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkryke3004t27nrb5uxbz42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People looking to lose weight and lower their blood sugar may someday be able to get a single injection that turns their cells into tiny factories churning out a protein that is essentially the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00033b6qtc0l6ze8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s the ambition of two biotech startups, New York-based RenBio and Fractyl Health in Massachusetts. Both companies have completed initial tests showing that their approaches work, at least in mice, and both have started tests in larger animals — pigs and monkeys — to see whether their gene therapies can work in larger animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00043b6qp5nbprgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With continued success and enough funding, they hope to bring the therapies to human patients — although it may take years more research to prove that their ideas work and are safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00053b6qcc4lb7o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer GLP-1 medications – available as injections and pills – have proven to be highly effective for weight loss, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00063b6qq5f058tc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone made by the body that helps signal to the brain and the gut that it’s full and doesn’t need to eat any more. The new weight loss drugs mimic the action of this hormone by increasing the secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar. They also slow the movement of food through the digestive tract, which helps people feel full more quickly and for longer, and they work in the brain to reduce appetite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00073b6qvw6dct54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In less than two years, the percentage of American adults using these meds for weight loss has roughly doubled, rising from 5.8% to 12%, according to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;a recent Gallup report&lt;/a&gt;. Their popularity may finally be making a dent in the nation’s obesity rate, which dropped from 39.9% in 2023 to 37% in 2025, according to Gallup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00083b6q1krx5qoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the medicines can be expensive, and up to half of users say they have side effects including nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Studies suggest that people need to continue using them to maintain their weight loss, but many people don’t love the idea of staying on them indefinitely. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly two-thirds of people without diabetes who started GLP-1 drugs stopped within a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00093b6qjibnhy3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next wave of research has sought to capitalize on the benefits of GLP-1s with fewer downsides. That’s where companies like Fractyl and RenBio come in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna000a3b6q4l0dg5nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fractyl is presenting &lt;a href="https://planion-client-files.s3.amazonaws.com/TOS/blobs/269179c7-14eb-4d25-8546-a221f38def74/1/HANDOUT_OW_2025_Seeley_et_al_PGTx.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the latest results&lt;/a&gt; from its trial of a gene therapy called Rejuva in mice at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society, called ObesityWeek, which is being held in Atlanta this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna000b3b6qgdll4hhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio shared its results from ongoing mouse studies as a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.30.656889v3" target="_blank"&gt;preprint paper&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it has not been peer reviewed or accepted into a medical journal, last month.  RenBio will also present updated findings at ObesityWeek.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrynfc00003b6qy9s3myh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio calls its technology “Make Your Own,” and it’s a relatively simple idea. They use a plasmid — a ring of naked DNA — in saline solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000j3b6q1etik32f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the instructions that the body uses to build and constantly refurbish itself. It lives in the nucleus, or brain, of every cell as a twisting, double-sided ladder. The ladder is made up of four individual nucleic acids, like the letters that make up words in a book, strung together in long chains that spell out the instructions for proteins.  The order of the letters tells the body how to make the proteins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000k3b6qjh7172g5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In RenBio’s case, the researchers spelled out the instructions to make a GLP-1 receptor agonist protein — essentially the same active ingredient in medicines like Ozempic and Mounjaro — and looped it into a small circle called a plasmid. They injected saline solution containing these plasmids into muscle tissue and used short electrical pulses — milliseconds long — to zap the muscle cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000l3b6qyultd0ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It works really efficiently. Basically, the electrical pulses transiently make little pores in the cell membrane that allow the DNA rings to slip into the cell,” said Dr. Rachel Liberatore, president and chief scientific officer at RenBio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000m3b6qpvn1tyd6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From there, the plasmids migrate to the nucleus, where they hang out in the jelly-like cytoplasm. When the cell gets ready to translate its own DNA, the plasmid DNA is read and translated right alongside it. When the cell reads the instructions, it builds the GLP-1 receptor agonist protein and releases it into the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000n3b6qcftrvrhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberatore said that although RenBio’s therapy uses a genetic technology, it’s not a traditional gene therapy: The researchers aren’t trying to fix a broken gene. Rather, they’re using the cell’s own machinery to turn it into a protein factory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000o3b6qwpsmy6om@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The DNA we’re injecting, the plasmid DNA, doesn’t interfere with your own DNA in any way. So it doesn’t interfere with your own chromosomes. It doesn’t integrate. It’s not something you’re going to pass on to your children,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000p3b6qx0ksenod@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio is also using this platform to make protein therapies that can be built in the same way, like antibodies to the Zika virus. The work is supported by the federal government’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA.  It’s also supported by the Wellcome Trust, a health research foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In RenBio’s most successful experiments, mice injected with the plasmids lost about 15% of their body weight, which was significantly more than mice in a placebo group. The loss was maintained for at least a year after they received the plasmid DNA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000r3b6qzlxvp0a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In each formulation tested, the weight loss leveled off in mice treated with the plasmids. In essence, they hit a plateau. But that’s a good thing if you’re using a long-acting therapy, Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000s3b6qo4retzt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were actually quite happy to see that, because you don’t necessarily want continued weight loss for a year, a year and a half,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000t3b6q1fwpxz25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Glucose tolerance tests show that blood sugar was better regulated, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000u3b6q72u7pkur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers aren’t sure how long the plasmids may remain active. The idea is that a doctor might give their patients a shot every year or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000v3b6qqk8ns438@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think what our take on it is, it’s really ideally suited for the sort of maintenance phase that people are starting to talk about with GLP-1s,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000w3b6qcqk5tlr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plasmid platform has also been tested on monkeys, and the researchers even used the device to inject themselves – albeit with pure saline, not with any plasmids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000x3b6qtuatzmjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio hopes to begin testing its plasma platform to deliver instructions for making antibodies against the Zika virus in people next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Targeting cells to help the body make more GLP-1
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0dvy000h3b6qqbsqpd6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another company called Fractyl Health is taking a slightly different approach. It uses a more traditional gene therapy technique in which the outer shell of a small virus — called an adeno-associated virus — slips DNA into cells and givens them the instructions to make GLP-1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00143b6q6pwhjabm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In rare cases, when viruses are used to deliver genes, they can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to potentially dangerous inflammation, allergic reactions or organ damage. In other cases, gene therapy vectors like viruses may wind up where they’re not supposed to be and can introduce errors into the genomes of cells, which &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cdnews/news/1778/Gene-Therapy-Causes-Cancer-in-Some-Children" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001i3b6q35y2j5wp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea is that a single treatment delivered directly to the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas would never need to be repeated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00153b6qwfnfqph3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because we are delivering it locally, we believe that we will need a very low dose of this virus, which helps gives us confidence in the potential safety in people,” said Dr. Harith Rajagopalan, co-founder and CEO of Fractyl Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00163b6qt7hr65jz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers have tried this in mice and pigs, and both tests were successful, Rajagopalan said. But mice and pigs aren’t humans, and many therapies that have succeeded in lab animals have gone on to fail in people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00173b6qqnjfiejg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is promise, but much more data would be needed to consider human clinical trials, as it likely would be irreversible,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, a distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics, at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at the University of California – Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00183b6qjkecfx0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The concern would be, the genetic change would be permanent so if there is over-expression … which may change with various states — weight loss, illness, aging, hormonal changes — it could cause problems from over-expression with no way to reverse, except remove the pancreas or treated muscle,” Kohn said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00193b6qhs823sdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kohn said there has long been a debate in gene therapy about whether it should be used for non-disease treatment, such as enhancement of height or muscle mass. In general, the feeling is that it should not be used for enhancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001a3b6qi1wz5iny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This certainly is near that line between Medicine and enhancement and so I think that’s another reason that needs to be considered whether this is something that should be gone into,” Kohn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001b3b6qr8kg9zng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fractyl says it has filed the regulatory paperwork in the US to start human trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001c3b6qit552yn4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We anticipate seeing human data in the next year, in 2026,” Rajagopalan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001d3b6qxuvm1mvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viruses are experts at infecting cells, so scientists use that capability to slip DNA into a cell, so the cell can start building the proteins the researchers want it to build – in this case, GLP-1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001e3b6q50cp7zbl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gene therapy like this can be risky, however, so in order to minimize the risk, the researchers designed their DNA to recognize the promoter sequence for insulin. Promoter sequences are short stretches of DNA that tell the cell’s copying machinery where a new protein starts. It acts like an on/off switch in the DNA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001f3b6q0rbd0kco@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By having the DNA sequence for GLP-1 recognize the insulin promoter, the researchers tied the function of their sequence to the production of insulin, another hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001g3b6qq8m9x63t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means only cells that make insulin will also make GLP-1, limiting the dose that’s delivered to the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001h3b6qj08c9qho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also creates a way to dial up or down the volume of extra GLP-1. When a mouse eats a high-fat, high-calorie meal, its body will make more insulin but also more GLP-1, to guard against weight gain. When it eats a more moderate serving of its normal chow, it won’t make as much GLP-1, so it won’t lose weight when it doesn’t need to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001j3b6q0z1jkfnx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In mice, the results have been encouraging, said Dr. Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies hormone signaling as it relates to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Fractyl hired Seeley to test the gene therapy, and he owns stock options in the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001k3b6qurx2gwh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Obese mice that were treated with the gene therapy, which Fractyl calls Rejuva, lost about 20% of their body weight within three weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001l3b6qlruvbgcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It outperformed semaglutide,” the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, Rajagopalan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001m3b6qz07rvbdf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When researchers treated normal-weight mice with the gene therapy and then fed them a high-fat diet, the mice did not gain weight. Their blood sugar also stayed normal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001n3b6q8ovs41mk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they gave the gene therapy to lean mice who ate their normal diet, the lean mice didn’t lose excessive amounts of weight. They also didn’t seem to develop dangerously low blood sugar, suggesting that it might be safe to use to prevent obesity as well as treat and maintain it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001o3b6q75oeppqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It might also be a way to prevent diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001p3b6qyudmfz1z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rajagopalan envisions a day when it might be possible to identify people at risk of obesity, because of a family history or other factors, and give them gene therapy to prevent that fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001q3b6qj4gl9gqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a food environment where processed foods have been engineered to trick the brain into eating unhealthy amounts, he sees this gene therapy as potentially helping people regain control over their appetite and health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001r3b6q2hlf1i9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Food is cheaper per calorie and more widely available than at any point in human history,” Rajagopalan said. “We’re just not built to make enough GLP-1 for the world around us.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001s3b6qdcqrfqpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The solution, he said, may be helping the body make more of its own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001t3b6qde3osk6r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a long way to go before you get there, and we can’t minimize the work involved. I mean, that’s equivalent to saying we’re going to colonize Mars, in terms of the magnitude of effort involved to get there,” Rajagopalan said. “But why not aspire to aspire to that?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3e93a3c9-94b8-4fc1-952b-2c6e11f9bb57"&gt;Can we change bad memories? In this adapted excerpt from "How to Change a Memory" (Princeton University Press, 2025), author and neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Steve Ramirez&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recounts the events that led him and his colleagues to discover memories could be artificially controlled in rodents, by tapping directly into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="078937a2-fe8a-4c02-8291-f0e714027515"&gt;&lt;p id="ad4660bd-5c49-4f3b-b60d-82dee64909d4" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Feelings like anxiety are hard to understand because they're often invisible to everyone else. But they're part of everyday life. We all regularly experience bouts of stress and anxiety. What if the job interviewer doesn't like me? Should I cram tonight for my exam tomorrow? What should I say on my first date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ad4660bd-5c49-4f3b-b60d-82dee64909d4-1"&gt;Our biology often forces us to be prepared for multiple outcomes in the midst of uncertainty. It's healthy to care about these multiple outcomes because it encourages us to put in the work, to adequately prep for a given stressful event. And yet, sometimes the scales of stress become tilted to such an extreme that pathologies of the brain begin to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tremendous variation in how any individual arrives at a state of anxiety, for example, highlights that our brain contains many winding roads that can ultimately converge on the same feeling. We all have our triggers in life, but what those triggers are depends on experience — on memory. When these differences impair our mood, thinking, behavior and overall daily functioning, then they get lumped into a category. What's more, if observed impairments share similar features, then this category itself falls within a broader classification — that of a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="35543d0f-56ff-4e96-9f29-3ca1a42fa8af"&gt;As I was entering my last year of graduate school, I was just beginning to understand how omnipresent an anxious feeling can truly be. Just as my own stressors in life began accumulating — finishing my thesis, writing grants and job applications, continuing the seemingly never-ending search for purpose as a scientist and person — my mom too had a sudden resurgence of anxious moments that ultimately culminated in frequent panic attacks. Once I learned about her lifelong experience with the erratic thing that anxiety was for her, I started to appreciate the on-again, off-again and on-again nature of these feelings. I couldn’t stop thinking about her panic attacks and how frustrating it was to not be able to press "&lt;em&gt;off" &lt;/em&gt;on some of the most debilitating moments one can endure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1bdcf3da-c9c8-4153-839d-6d30921a8ac6"&gt;My last project in graduate school would attempt to artificially activate positive memories to suppress the symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. It would be my most personal scientific endeavor, a very direct way for me to join the fight at my mom's side and to thank her for being my superhero. If my research could somehow inspire new therapeutic strategies that might be useful for alleviating these kinds of debilitating conditions, then my work will have gained an even deeper, more personally meaningful purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lab partner Xu Liu and I wanted to take a brain-centric approach to our newest project. Could memory itself be artificially controlled in rodents, by tapping directly into the brain to restore neuronal and behavioral balance in a therapeutic name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-u39R7hRxDfKpmnR8cZS6wm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-u39R7hRxDfKpmnR8cZS6wm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, our project had a scientific precedent in humans — in an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3128334/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3128334/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influential paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by psychologist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/barbara-fredrickson/" target="_blank" data-url="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/barbara-fredrickson/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Barbara Fredrickson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues called "The undoing effect of positive emotions." This study highlighted the capacity of positive emotions to undo the physiological effects that negative emotions have on the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undoing hypothesis proposes that positive emotions can be used for more than just feeling good. They can be used to help us get out of bed in the morning; pursue happiness; change how we think about and interact with ourselves and others; and counteract, or at least regulate, negative emotions. When human subjects were stressed and then watched movie clips that elicited contentment and amusement, their bodies rebounded in beneficial ways: their stress-induced increases in cardiovascular activity, for instance, returned to baseline faster than when they watched neutral or sad movie clips. Excitingly, this reveals a very real physical connection between feelings of positivity and their direct effects on our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xu and I wanted to further this work by testing for a potential therapeutic capacity of positive memories by jump-starting their biology from within&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the brain. We placed our animals in a box that had two small valves on separate ends: one that delivered sugar water when the animals licked it and another that delivered regular water. This is known as the sucrose preference test. Rodents normally prefer sugar water over regular water, the same way humans will typically find sugary liquids preferable to a bland liquid. On the other hand, rodents with depression-and anxiety-related behaviors tend to show a 50:50 preference. They show no preference at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the animals displaying anxiety-and depression-related behavior licked at each of the valves randomly over the course of 15 minutes. As with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://behavioralscientist.org/manipulating-memory-through-optogenetics-qa-with-neuroscientists-xu-liu-and-steve-ramirez/" target="_blank" data-url="https://behavioralscientist.org/manipulating-memory-through-optogenetics-qa-with-neuroscientists-xu-liu-and-steve-ramirez/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — our first successful attempt at MIT to artificially control memories in the rodent brain — all we had to do was hit a button that would turn our lasers on and optogenetically awaken a memory from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep-blue laser flickered throughout the mouse’s hippocampus, waking up — activating&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— cells that held onto a positive memory. I remember thinking that our optogenetic stimulation was a fancy, high-tech Proustian madeleine, one capable of triggering the rich remembrance of things past. If you'll entertain my romanticization of the moment: the mouse perked up immediately, as if a shudder ran from its brain to its body, and it began scanning the environment to decide which valve to visit first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary thing was happening. I imagine that the mouse felt the memory invade all its senses, strangely detached and with no suggestion of an origin, since the essence of these sensations was &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;the mouse as much as it &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;the mouse. And once the positive memory fully revealed itself within seconds, the now-motivated mouse inspected each valve with some sniffing, followed by a taste test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f31f1ee4-25fd-437a-a4be-34016c009bf8"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to reversing abnormal behavior was embedded within their positive memories all along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="316ea602-7387-4367-984c-5634c5157a9e"&gt;When it found the valve with the sugar water, the mouse started licking vigorously, so much so that it consumed as much sugar water as our control animals. In under an hour, Xu and I saw that reactivating positive memories restored our mice's behavior to a healthy baseline. Just as exciting, reactivating positive memories also turned on many areas of the brain involved in rewarding experiences and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to reversing abnormal behavior was embedded within their positive memories all along. For as long as the laser was shining its sapphire radiance in their brains, the mice were motivated to keep consuming their sugar water reward. All this from stimulating cells in the hippocampus. Or to say this with less novelistic flare: the mice got a sugary treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following weeks, one of my gifted undergraduates &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/briana-chen" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/briana-chen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Briana Chen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; collected a large empirical dataset for the project, and it came with an exciting plot twist: when she artificially reactivated positive memories twice a day, or "chronically," for about a week, not only did this permanently ameliorate symptoms we believed were associated with depression and anxiety, but it also promoted&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the growth of new cells in the brain. Positive memories had both short- and long-term benefits, all the way from cells to behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;neuro-centric Research Domain Criteria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (RDoC) approach to treating the brain, our hope was that the biological potency of positive memories — like medications — could inform cognitive-behavioral approaches to treating disorders of the brain. This project was meaningful to me on a personal level: I thought of my mom's panic attacks and the idea that she might never have to experience the kind of crippling anxiety that robs someone of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive memories are some of the most powerful biological tools available in our brains. At home, my mom and I shared a treasure trove of them — one that we both remember is from the time when I was a teenager, and we were visiting her parents in El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning, my cousins, parents and grandparents all walked down a hill behind the house my mom grew up in to go swimming in the village pond. My cousins kept egging me on to jump from a cliff into the pond, and my mom kept telling me I didn't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like her, I was the opposite of an adrenaline-seeker because, oh I don't know, maybe my innate biology was onto something, as "please do not free-fall to Earth" kept repeating in my mind. She could see that I was scared, and after a few minutes she suggested, much to my surprise, that we jump together. We held hands and tiptoed to the edge — &lt;em&gt;uno&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tres &lt;/em&gt;— we were in the air! Moments later, we emerged from the water laughing in delightful disbelief at our newfound courage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b080303f-477d-4385-9c00-161cb1364dd7"&gt;Neuroscience tells us that this memory has all the ingredients of life's dessert that make us feel good. From an RDoC perspective, my cognitive and valence systems are all interacting to produce the riches from this experience: the cognitive system enables the memory of jumping off of a cliff, which at first generated feelings of fear via the negative valence systems, which are now almost immediately counteracted by feelings of reward via the positive valence systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once a moment of fear is now a memory of triumph with my mom. It's the only time I can remember when we both took a literal leap of faith, so we cherish the memory as an example of what our brains can achieve together. A million little life moments like these, packaged neatly into a million memories that we hold onto constitute the good stuff in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="442bfef3-8420-4720-8bcd-ef948a521e15"&gt;&lt;p id="dda2c8cc-94c4-4bc2-b874-e2c0b49c5ff8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from &lt;/em&gt;"How To Change a Memory: One Neuroscientist's Quest To Alter The Past"&lt;em&gt;.

(WITN) - The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission is looking into a possible case of a contagious disease among deer in Edgecombe County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;N.C. Wildlife is reporting a potential case of Chronic Wasting Disease, or CWD, after a preliminary test result from a three-and-a-half-year-old male white-tailed deer came back positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say the deer was harvested by a hunter in the eastern corner of the county, a few miles from the Pitt-Martin County line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;If confirmed as positive, the deer would be the 35th CWD-positive deer found in North Carolina since the initial detection of the disease in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The sample is currently being tested by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory to verify the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The closest confirmed location from this new suspected site is in Cumberland County, nearly 100 miles away, according to officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;CWD is transmissible to other deer and spreads through infected body fluids, like saliva, urine, feces and the movement of infected deer carcasses and carcass parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Because deer may appear healthy during the early stages of infection, officials are stressing to hunters the importance of taking precautions when moving or disposing of deer carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;N.C. Wildlife asks hunters to submit deer harvested in Edgecombe County and the surrounding areas for testing. They’re also asked to keep the deer and its high-risk carcass parts in the county of origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;All hunters are encouraged to follow these disposal methods for non-edible portions of carcasses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bury deer remains where you harvest the animal when possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Double-bag deer remains for disposal in a landfill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave the deer remains on the ground where the animal was harvested&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Low-risk carcass parts, like boned-out meat, caped hides, antlers, cleaned jawbones, skulls and teeth, as well as finished taxidermy products, are safe to transport outside of Edgecombe County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control have not reported any cases of CWD infection in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;N.C. Wildlife says, though there is no scientific evidence that CWD can infect humans, some animal studies have suggested that it poses a risk to certain types of non-human primates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;More information and updates regarding CWD in North Carolina can be found on N.C.

			&lt;p&gt;Usually, the chemical mist released when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-the-real-reason-cutting-onions-make-you-cry-according-to-science"&gt;onions are chopped&lt;/a&gt; – propanethial S-oxide – makes our eyes water. Now scientists have found a simple way to keep those tears to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments by researchers from Cornell University in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-stone-technologies-suggest-early-humans-were-social-across-long-distances"&gt;sharper blades&lt;/a&gt; and slower cuts significantly reduced the amount of onion mist given off during preparation, keeping eyes drier and kitchen surfaces safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomechanist Zixuan Wu and team used a mini guillotine, a high-resolution camera, and sensors to carefully track the droplets expelled as onions were cut, comparing mist characteristics against knife sharpness, chopping speed, and cutting force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-absolute-worst-thickness-for-a-paper-cut"&gt;Scientists Reveal The Absolute Worst Thickness For a Paper Cut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found out the speed of the mist coming out is much higher compared to the speed of the blade cutting through," &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/10/mist-opportunity-reveals-how-onions-make-cooks-cry"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physicist Sunghwan Jung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179666" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DropletAnalysis.jpg" alt="Onion mist analysis" class="wp-image-179666 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DropletAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DropletAnalysis-600x265.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179666" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used high-resolution imagery to track droplet travel. (Wu et al., &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every layer in an onion has a top and bottom skin, and as those layers are breached, the analysis showed there are two resulting effects: an instantaneous explosion of mist, and then a slower seep of fluids through the layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blunter knives created substantially more droplets and faster sprays, the researchers found. Because they require more force to break the skins, pressure builds in the onion's juices. Quicker, forceful cuts with a dull blade propelled droplets even farther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial ejection of the droplets can be at very high speeds, the observations showed, and can get up to 40 meters per second – that's 144 kilometers (89 miles) per hour. It's these droplets that pose the greatest threats to eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to debunk the common theory that chilled onions give off less mist and are better at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-your-body-may-need-to-shed-some-tears-even-if-you-don-t-feel-sad"&gt;reducing tears&lt;/a&gt; related to chopping. The starting temperature of the onions didn't appear to make any real difference; if anything, chilling them made things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These observations were supported by theoretical models that accurately capture independently measured fracture forces," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2512779122"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of onions in the kitchen stretches back some 5,000 years, and there's even a mention of the tears that live in an onion in Shakespeare's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra"&gt;Antony and Cleopatra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a much better idea of how the aerosols that cause those tears are created and released, and what can be done about it. Using sharp blades and gentle cuts keeps the droplet mist below eye level, the team found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery has implications for food safety, too. If bacteria are present, cutting style influences how they spread. As we saw with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-ingredient-behind-deadly-mcdonalds-outbreak-identified"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; outbreak at McDonald's in the US&lt;/a&gt; just last year, many people can get sick very quickly through pathogens spread by onions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Suppose you have pathogens on the very top layer on the onion," &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/10/mist-opportunity-reveals-how-onions-make-cooks-cry"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jung.

We don’t have a complete picture of virus circulation of the variants that are out there,” says Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of the department of epidemic and pandemic management at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. “I think there’s a collective amnesia right now about COVID-19,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if people do test positive after using a home antibody test, there is no way to report a positive result in the community, says Antonia Ho, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without high-quality surveillance data, Ho warns that health organizations are not well-prepared to recommend corresponding vaccine formulations and time their roll-out. “Surveillance is critical to really understand what’s circulating,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is COVID-19 being tracked?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although surveillance data that are used to track the absolute number of SARS-CoV-2 infections are less robust than during the pandemic, researchers are tracking information about the number of people with severe COVID-19 who require hospitalization. “Hospital-based surveillance is what we’re mostly doing. But we also have wastewater surveillance, which is quite a useful indicator of what’s happening in the community,” Ho says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic analysis of samples containing the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus shows that the most common variants currently circulating globally are XFG, also known as Stratus or the 'Frankenstein variant', and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. Stratus accounts for 76% of reported cases and is dominant in Europe and the Americas, whereas Nimbus is dominant in the Western Pacific region, accounting for 15% of cases, says Van Kerkhove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00459-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03412-x/d41586-025-03412-x_50648964.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratus and Nimbus have similar symptoms to previous variants including a fever, cough and runny nose, but the Nimbus variant has one distinct symptom: a ‘razor blade’ sore throat. These two variants are currently on the WHO’s list of ‘currently circulating COVID-19 variants under monitoring’ as of 4 September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Kerkhove says the latest information about SARS‑CoV‑2 strains is far from the complete picture of viral circulation. Even hospitalization data aren’t as complete as they were during the pandemic — &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track="click" data-label="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;fewer than 35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track="click" data-label="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track-category="body text link"&gt; countries still report COVID-19 data&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s why we’re trying to make sure that countries are still doing sequencing,” says Van Kerkhove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she adds that the surveillance data currently available are sufficient to “provide information to governments related to the effectiveness of vaccines”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is COVID-19 seasonal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01326-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01326-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Vaccination campaigns&lt;/a&gt; are focused on people over the age of 65 in the US, or 75 in the UK and parts of Europe, and those with a weakened immune system who are older than 6 months. Michael Head, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, UK, says he would prefer a wider vaccine roll-out for younger populations as well. “It’s still not a pleasant infection, and vaccines do still have a significant public-health benefit, so they are a vital tool in addressing the threat posed by COVID-19”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                                                    &lt;h2 class="first-paragraph"&gt;By examining decades of research, we found that for most people who think they react to gluten, gluten itself is rarely the cause.&lt;/h2&gt;
                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Social media and lifestyle magazines have turned gluten – a protein in wheat, rye and barley – into a dietary villain. &lt;a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/novak-djokovic-gluten-free-diet"&gt;Athletes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/food/pictures/celebrities-who-follow-gluten-free-diets/"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; have promoted gluten-free eating as the secret to better health and performance. But our recent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;review in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; challenges that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms but not coeliac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease is when the body’s immune system attacks itself when someone eats gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the gut. But people with gut or other symptoms after eating foods containing gluten can test &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; for coeliac disease or wheat allergy. They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were “gluten sensitive” reacted equally – or more strongly – to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn’t have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests most people who feel unwell after eating gluten are sensitive to something else. This could be FODMAPs such as fructans, or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="in-article-action-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people’s symptoms. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo. This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations. These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn’t mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our wellbeing. People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential. But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there’s no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimise the quality of someone’s overall diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured re-introduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn’t explain someone’s symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That’s because expectation, stress and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic “gluten is bad” narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care. &lt;strong&gt;DM&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Mental sharpness after 70 has less to do with genetics and more to do with how you use your brain daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother is 76 and runs intellectual circles around people decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She remembers details from conversations months ago. She learns new technology faster than my teenage cousins. She reads complex books and discusses them with nuance and insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she's not exceptional because of genetics or luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's sharp because of how she lives. The habits she's maintained for decades. The ways she challenges her brain consistently without making it feel like work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 share these habits. They're not doing elaborate brain training programs or expensive interventions. They're living in ways that naturally maintain and even improve cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are seven things that people over 70 who are sharper than most 40-year-olds consistently do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They read daily and discuss what they've read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 read regularly. Not just scanning headlines or social media, but actual sustained reading. Books, long articles, material that requires focus and comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading alone doesn't create the sharpness. It's the discussion afterward that matters. They talk about what they've read with friends, family, or book clubs. They process the information actively by articulating thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination exercises multiple cognitive skills. Focus and concentration during reading. Memory recall when discussing it later. Critical thinking when forming opinions. Verbal articulation when explaining ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who read but never discuss what they've read get fewer cognitive benefits. The active processing through conversation is where much of the mental exercise happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They maintain meaningful social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation is terrible for cognitive health. The sharpest people over 70 maintain active social lives with regular, substantive interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't surface-level connections. They're friendships where real conversations happen. Where ideas are exchanged. Where people challenge each other intellectually while maintaining warmth and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social interaction exercises your brain in ways that solo activities can't. You're reading social cues, responding appropriately, following conversation threads, remembering context about people's lives. All of this keeps cognitive pathways active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who isolate after retirement often show faster cognitive decline. The brain needs social stimulation to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They keep learning new skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 don't stop learning. They take classes, learn instruments, pick up new hobbies, master new technologies. They challenge their brains with genuinely new information and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from doing the same crossword puzzle every day. Novel learning creates new neural pathways. It forces your brain to work in unfamiliar ways. That struggle is what maintains cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother learned Spanish at 68. She takes online courses on topics that interest her. She learned to use a smartphone and tablet without help. Each new skill challenges her brain and proves to herself that she's still capable of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific skill matters less than the act of learning something genuinely new. The discomfort of being a beginner is actually beneficial. It signals to your brain that it needs to stay plastic and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They stay physically active in consistent ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical movement affects cognitive function more than most people realize. Sharp people over 70 move their bodies regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily intense exercise. Just consistent movement. Walking, swimming, yoga, gardening. Activities that get blood flowing and keep the body functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain. It supports the growth of new brain cells. It helps manage the inflammation that can contribute to cognitive decline. And it maintains the body-brain connection that's crucial for overall function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People over 70 who become sedentary often show faster mental decline. The body and brain are connected. Taking care of one supports the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They challenge themselves with complex mental tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 don't avoid difficult thinking. They seek it out. They do things that require concentration, problem-solving, and mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be strategy games, complex puzzles, learning new recipes, planning trips, managing finances, writing. Whatever requires genuine cognitive effort rather than passive consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that these tasks stretch their abilities without becoming so frustrating they give up. They find the sweet spot where the challenge is real but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother does the New York Times crossword puzzle, but she also plans elaborate meals from scratch, manages her investments, and writes long letters to friends. All of these require focus, memory, planning, and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who default to passive activities like watching TV exclusively miss this cognitive stimulation. Your brain needs to be challenged regularly to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain curiosity about the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 haven't lost their curiosity. They still want to understand how things work, why things happen, what's new and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask questions. They look things up. They explore ideas. They stay engaged with current events and new developments. Their minds remain active and interested rather than settling into fixed patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curiosity drives many of the other habits. It's why they read. Why they take classes. Why they have substantive conversations. The curiosity itself is what keeps them mentally engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who lose curiosity often lose mental sharpness. When you stop caring about understanding new things, your brain has less reason to stay engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They get quality sleep consistently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This habit is less obvious but critically important. Sharp people over 70 prioritize sleep and have consistent sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is when your brain consolidates memories, clears waste products, and repairs itself. Chronic poor sleep accelerates cognitive decline. Quality sleep protects against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go to bed and wake at consistent times. They've created sleep environments that support rest. They don't sacrifice sleep for entertainment or out of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people let sleep habits deteriorate as they age. They stay up late watching TV because they have no schedule to keep. They nap irregularly, disrupting nighttime sleep. Poor sleep patterns contribute significantly to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why these habits compound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seven habits work together. Physical activity supports better sleep. Social connections drive curiosity. Learning new things provides conversation topics. Reading fuels discussion. It's all interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the effects compound over time. Someone who's done these things for decades has protected and strengthened their cognitive function in ways that become obvious by 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is it's never too late to start. While maintaining these habits from midlife forward is ideal, adopting them at any age provides benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother didn't always do all these things. She developed many of these habits after retirement when she realized she needed structure and purpose. But decades of consistency has kept her mind remarkably sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 aren't just lucky with genetics. They're people who've lived in ways that support cognitive health. They've stayed engaged, curious, social, and active. They've challenged their brains regularly. They've taken care of their bodies and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these habits require money or special circumstances. They're accessible to anyone willing to prioritize them. The challenge is consistency. Doing them not occasionally but as regular parts of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 70 and still doing these seven things, your mind is likely sharper than most people decades younger. Not because you're exceptional, but because you've maintained habits that support cognitive function while many others have let those habits slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're not over 70 yet, these habits are worth adopting now. The earlier you start, the more you benefit. But even starting later provides protection and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental sharpness after 70 is largely within your control. It's the result of how you live, how you use your brain, and what you prioritize. These seven habits are the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Ever worried that skipping breakfast might leave you foggy at work? Or that intermittent fasting would make you irritable, distracted and less productive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack food ads warn us that "you're not you when you're hungry", reinforcing a common belief that eating is essential to keep our brains sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This message is deeply woven into our culture. We're told constant fuelling is the secret to staying alert and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/43/2/405/6371193"&gt;time-restricted eating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMra1905136"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; have become hugely popular wellness practices over the past decade. Millions do it for long-term benefits, from weight management to improved metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-junk-foods-are-worst-for-brain-health"&gt;The Junk Foods That Harm Your Brain Most, Ranked by New Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises a pressing question: can we reap the health rewards of fasting without sacrificing our mental edge? To find out, we conducted the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000492"&gt;most comprehensive review to date&lt;/a&gt; of how fasting affects cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why fast in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting isn't just a trendy diet hack. It taps into a biological system honed over millennia to help humans cope with scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we eat regularly, the brain runs mostly on glucose, stored in the body as glycogen. But after about 12 hours without food, those glycogen stores dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, the body performs a clever &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01254-5"&gt;metabolic switch&lt;/a&gt;: it begins breaking down fat into ketone bodies (for example, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate), which provide an alternative fuel source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This metabolic flexibility, once crucial for our ancestors' survival, is now being linked to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5783752/"&gt;host of health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180035" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock-.jpg" alt="Vegetables on one quarter of a plate, with a clock on the opposite quarter" class="size-full wp-image-180035" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock-.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock--600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180035" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting have become hugely popular wellness practices over the past decade. (IvanSpasic/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most promising effects of fasting come from the way it reshapes processes inside the body. For instance, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy"&gt;fasting activates autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, a kind of cellular "cleanup crew" that clears away damaged components and recycles them, a process thought to support healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also improves &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the body to manage blood sugar more effectively and lowering the risk of conditions such as type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="180027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the metabolic shifts triggered by fasting appear to offer broader protection, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-020-00013-3"&gt;helping reduce the likelihood&lt;/a&gt; of developing chronic diseases often associated with overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the data showed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These physiological benefits have made fasting attractive. But many hesitate to adopt it out of fear their mental performance will plummet without a steady supply of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we conducted a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="180027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a "study of studies", looking at all the available experimental research that compared people's cognitive performance when they were fasting versus when they were fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our search identified 63 scientific articles, representing 71 independent studies, with a combined sample of 3,484 participants tested on 222 different measures of cognition. The research spanned nearly seven decades, from 1958 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pooling the data, our conclusion was clear: there was no meaningful difference in cognitive performance between fasted and satiated healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People performed just as well on cognitive tests measuring attention, memory and executive function whether they had eaten recently or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When fasting does matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis did reveal three important factors that can change how fasting affects your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, age is key. Adults showed no measurable decline in mental performance when fasting. But children and adolescents did worse on tests when they skipped meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their developing brains seem more sensitive to fluctuations in energy supply. This reinforces longstanding advice: kids should go to school with a proper breakfast to support learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing also seems to make a difference. We found longer fasts were associated with a smaller performance gap between fasted and fed states. This might be due to the metabolic switch to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25177-ketones"&gt;ketones&lt;/a&gt;, which can restore a steady supply of energy to the brain as glucose runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance in fasted individuals tended to be worse when tests were conducted later in the day, suggesting fasting might amplify the natural dips in our circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of test also mattered. When cognitive tasks involved neutral symbols or shapes, fasting participants performed just as well, or sometimes even slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when tasks included food-related cues, fasted participants slipped. Hunger doesn't create universal brain fog, but it does make us more easily distracted when food is on our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, the findings offer reassurance: you can explore intermittent fasting or other fasting protocols without worrying that your mental sharpness will vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, fasting isn't a one-size-fits-all practice. Caution is warranted with children and teens, whose brains are still developing and who appear to need regular meals to perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if your job requires peak alertness late in the day, or if you're frequently exposed to tempting food cues, fasting might feel harder to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, for certain groups, such as those with medical conditions or special dietary needs, fasting may not be advisable without professional guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, fasting is best seen as a personal tool rather than a universal prescription. And its benefits and challenges will look different from person to person.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264019/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

I've heard that the results that essentially stopped HRT for decades were flawed in their interpretation. Is this correct? If so, are there new recommendations for women to start HRT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I am a 63-year-old female in excellent health and am trying to research the topic before my next doctor's appointment in a couple of months. I am also concerned that my own doctor may not have the appropriate training to prescribe HRT, as I've heard there is a whole generation of doctors who have not been trained in prescribing hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— B.H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear B.H.:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn't say the studies (primarily the Women's Health Initiative but several others) were flawed so much; their interpretation needs to include the age of subjects in the study and the intervention given, particularly the choice and dose of both the estrogen and progestin. (In women with a uterus, a progestin must be given to reduce the risk of uterine cancer that is associated with estrogen therapy alone.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I do agree with you that HRT is probably underused as the most effective treatment of many symptoms of menopause. The mean age of women starting HRT in the WHI was 63, exactly your age as it turns out. In this group, there was a significant increase in the risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A careful reinterpretation of the data suggested that younger women (aged 50-59 or those within 10 years of stopping their periods) probably had no excess risk of heart disease and may have had a reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Estrogen has beneficial effects on cholesterol and on the lining of the blood vessels, but it also increases blood-clotting risk (when given by mouth). So, estrogen may prevent blockages but also make an existing blockage develop a clot, which is the essential step in a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The current estrogen that is most commonly used by experts (estradiol, the bioidentical major human estrogen) and the current most frequently used progestin (micronized progesterone, also a bioidentical hormone) have less risk of causing cancer than the types used in most studies (conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone). Some studies have shown a reduced risk of breast cancer in estrogen-only regimens, while others have still shown an increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The blood-clotting risk is a significant consideration, with all oral estrogens increasing risk. Women who used an estrogen patch had no significant increase in clotting risk. In my opinion, the benefits of HRT in symptomatic women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause may outweigh the risks, but the decision still needs to be made after a careful discussion of risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I do not recommend initiating HRT in women who are both over 60 and are more than 10 years postmenopausal due to the increased risk of heart disease and stroke. I do not start HRT in asymptomatic women just to prevent disease. Further studies are required before I would change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are still other considerations (benefits in reducing colon cancer and fractures with HRT; a possible small harm in other cancers; no clear benefit in preventing dementia; and a reduction in the rate of new diabetes cases) that are appropriate in some women who have particular health concerns or family histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;All general gynecologists as well as many primary care doctors in family and internal medicine are trained in HRT and should know the latest data.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:03:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNbF9yMDdrM3QydzVFdnJYMlBiU1piajZQVVlwYWRucGZKUjA3cmFtZUJaQnplNWZYa010SzlOT3JlMWM1TUNWQkluaWxXVjNmSkZlN1EyYkpJX3k0enFjZkwwWFFIWmlQRVZrZFZhMDNjejRjVFFhblp1MWxZc2ZLSU1fTnBZRS15RTI0Yk5EbG1obHhXUGIySF9ldlhGeHd3c3d0d1VEcU9meG4xdVFKWUY0T0VZT3BMZkRxUkI4TGZCWUxQZks2RFBJYWNXTWc</guid></item><item><title>醒来尿尿是否正常？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/well/nocturia-bathroom-night-sleep.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:00:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5VaUJRYmJSNXhwQUtUSkprdW8xNE4xU2pTV1BCa21aUlZzb1ptdUhMeDdtM01PbGs1NHZWUXB5ZEllS0FydnpXWFd4SEp4anpQSDgzRFZIa2tuVUk1V2dQUGJtWWhYNnJpZnp5em0zdExXVTFrcmhIel85QUVPSjg</guid></item><item><title>这种鲜为人知的饮食实际上可以降低胆固醇-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/well/eat/health-benefits-portfolio-diet-cholesterol.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOR1R2aDZ0eGdEakRIMVpsU00zSmpDbldGU3laelM1V2pmdjlYOFJVZXEzVy1PTVJVbUZLX2VXMWxuZkc1Q2wxaWU1OVEtblNDTGVWMzc3TzlOVE8tY205UXBMYnNuNkhXbXpHak1zYUJ6QXJjR2ZFbGZ0Qy1sNVJHc0RrbkhHVUNXVU5EWkJUMkdlRmkyOXc</guid></item><item><title>婴儿的第一次大便可以告诉你他们未来的健康状况- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251103-what-a-babys-first-poo-can-tell-you-about-their-future-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By day seven, vaginally-born babies tended to have either &lt;i id="b.longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.longum&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i id="b.brevae" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.brevae&lt;/i&gt; in their digestive tracts, while babies born via C-section were more likely to be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1560-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;colonised by &lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The gut microbiome of vaginally born babies tended to match that of their mothers, confirming that bacteria are passed mostly from the mother's gut, not her vagina. Meanwhile, babies born via C-section had more bacteria associated with hospital environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"&lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; is a bacteria that's associated with opportunistic infection. So if your immune system is not working very well, it can cause disease," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers found the differences in gut bacteria between vaginally-born and caesarean-delivered babies largely evened out by the time the infant turned one. However, there were signs that having good bacteria from day one gave babies a health advantage. The team tracked over 1,000 of the babies to see if any were admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We were able to see that babies whose guts were dominated by &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; were about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00340-9/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;half as likely&lt;/a&gt; to be admitted for a respiratory tract infection within the first two years of life, when compared to the &lt;i id="b.-brevae" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. brevae&lt;/i&gt; babies and the &lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; babies," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In other words, having &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; seemed to protect some vaginally-born infants from respiratory conditions. It's possible that the absence of beneficial gut bacteria like &lt;i id="b.longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.longum&lt;/i&gt; could explain why babies born via C-section have a slightly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00645-7/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;elevated risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing certain inflammatory conditions such as asthma, allergies, autoimmune disorders and obesity, although more work is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:58:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQYm5BWS1rbUo3OXR5SnVNd2FWZ2ZPZzBfUUk4Y0l1U3hnd0tBSDRDbTVkbm00Y0g2bEJNSEJOOTZndmdmVzFzQUtNVkhuRnhtVko1bVR1M0JGcHE2WjZLdjI2a1E3WG1xZlVEdG5SRUtrcEdIMFZDMndRMl9tWndvN1JkSDJLWE1TbjQtMFRtbV9PUmdlRlRJVVVRZFpBU2JLa0dFRUFhQVo</guid></item><item><title>我是一名研究记忆操纵的神经科学家。我的工作帮助我从成瘾中恢复过来- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/addiction-brain-healing-choice-neuroscience/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When philosophers imagined the &lt;a href="https://open.library.okstate.edu/introphilosophy/chapter/ship-of-theseus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ship of Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, they asked: Can a vessel that has all its planks replaced one by one over time as it sails uncharted waters still be considered the same ship?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience offers a fascinating answer to this conundrum: yes — and not quite. The brain is rebuilt in much the same way, plank by plank, neuron by neuron. Cells are born and die, synapses rewire, and entire populations of neurons drift in and out of activity, even as our sense of self seems to sail on undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For me, this isn’t just an abstract metaphor for how the brain works. It’s the reality I’ve lived through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I study memory at Boston University, where my lab investigates how specific networks of brain cells encode, store, and even rewrite memories. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14514" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, that artificially activating positive memories in mice can buffer against stress and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But my most personal experiment came when alcohol rewired my brain from within and quietly began rotting its most important planks. For about a decade, I spiraled, until I made the decision to channel my brain’s innate changeability not toward oblivion, but toward health, healing, and the possibility of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In biology, change isn’t optional — it’s the default setting. Nearly every cell in the body eventually turns over, and every memory we revisit reshapes its own neural circuitry. Memory is not a static recording; it’s a living reconstruction. That same plasticity that allows us to learn and adapt also leaves us vulnerable to patterns that hijack the system. Down to our DNA, biology is always in motion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, the intersection of adversity and genetic predisposition creates the illusion of stasis. We become stuck and live inside the moments we’re trying to escape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addiction, at its core, is memory’s dark side: an overlearned association between relief and a substance, rehearsed until it becomes automatic. I learned this the hard way. After the sudden death of my dear friend and lab partner, Xu Liu, I pressed forward in the lab, driven by a need to preserve his legacy through the science we loved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But underneath the progress, grief and exhaustion began to carve new paths in my brain. What started as a nightly drink to soften the edges turned into a ritual of escape. Then, it turned into something I couldn’t live without. I’d wake up at 3 a.m. and &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to take double shots of liquor, for instance, just to fend off the physical and mental torment that withdrawals bring with them. The same scientist who studied memory manipulation found himself manipulated by memory — seeking oblivion to avoid reliving loss, and refusing to face the full weight of the finality inherent to death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my oldest friends and my wife staged an informal intervention. The ship that was me, creaking under the weight of silence and grief, wasn’t going to capsize on their watch. Their message was simple and unshakable: connection, not control, is what saves you. I joined the Recovery Elevator Café RE community, which is an alternative to AA without any presumed religious affiliation, and it was there that I first internalized a phrase that now anchors both my work and my life: &lt;em&gt;The opposite of addiction is connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just an emotional breakthrough. It was a neurobiological one. Positive social interaction floods the brain with chemicals like oxytocin and dopamine, which aren’t just feel-good modulators in the brain; they’re molecular glue that helps form new neural links. Healing, like memory, is a relational act: Neurons that fire together wire together — and people who are present for one another become presents for one another. In recovery, connection became my new experiment. I began retraining my brain to extract reward from conversation, from movement, from simply being here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sobriety didn’t restore the old version of me; it allowed me to build a new one from the driftwood of the past. Just like the ship of Theseus, recovery is an iterative reconstruction. I suspect that the neurons that once fired when I reached for a drink now activate when I reach for conversation, exercise, or moments of gratitude. In this sense, biology doesn’t erase. It repurposes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Some of the hardest memories I carry have become the most instructive. The darkest among them center on the handful of nights where I nearly drank myself to death. Yet today, I no longer feel shame. Those memories have changed — from raw grief to a deep, sustaining gratitude that the same neuroplasticity that once fueled my addiction also powered my recovery. In scientific terms, the physical underpinnings of memory, the &lt;em&gt;engram,&lt;/em&gt; has been updated. In human terms, it’s through updating what these memories mean to me that I’ve found a sort of internal redemption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This personal shift parallels what we observe in the lab. When we activate positive memories in mice, their stress responses &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5583720/pdf/nihms898575.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diminish&lt;/a&gt;; their brains literally &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13725" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;re-route emotional traffic&lt;/a&gt;. In humans, therapy and mindfulness work similarly by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31482135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;re-contextualizing painful memories&lt;/a&gt; until they begin to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26906-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;soften their emotional sting&lt;/a&gt;. Neural ensembles that once encoded fear are gradually replaced or quieted by those representing the present. Biology calls this representational drift. I’ve come to believe life calls it healing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That principle — using good memories as antidotes — guides both my research and my recovery. Every week, I ask students, fellow people in recovery, or readers to recall moments that remind them of who they are at their best. Each recollection lays down a new plank on the ship of Theseus. Over time, the vessel becomes strong enough to carry grief without capsizing under it. I do this because addiction isolates, but recovery reconnects. At Café RE, sharing stories of relapse and redemption helped rewire my shame into empathy. &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=MzOpDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PT9&amp;amp;dq=opposite+of+addiction+is+connection&amp;amp;ots=PBWIW8lp_x&amp;amp;sig=QOAcZKyUDQWLep_4N12nH1lkiLw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=opposite%20of%20addiction%20is%20connection&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social connection&lt;/a&gt; here isn’t just therapeutic — it’s literally chemical. It boosts serotonin, steadies cortisol, and restores activity in areas of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33177112/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; like prefrontal cortex, the brain’s control center. The very systems that addiction hijacks can, with community, be recruited for resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to think of recovery as a single turning point, a before-and-after moment. But the brain reminds us it’s a continual process. Sobriety isn’t a finish line. It’s an ongoing act of remembering differently, of choosing, again and again, which version of ourselves we want to reinforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When people hear that my lab can “create and delete” memories in rodents, they picture some sci-fi mind wipe. But the reality is subtler and more hopeful. Memory manipulation isn’t about erasure. It’s about reshaping emotional tone and what experiences mean to us. We can quiet the fear tied to a traumatic memory without deleting the event itself. Therapy works the same way: reframing a painful story while honoring its truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s what I did with my own past. Xu’s death, once too painful to bear, now feels like a lesson plan for love, loyalty, and purpose. The nights I nearly died drinking have become a reference point for gratitude. My memories didn’t vanish. They evolved. And in changing them, I changed myself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience has a name for this: post-traumatic growth. It’s the measurable increase in empathy, gratitude, and meaning that can follow crisis. Brains that survive trauma often emerge more connected, more flexible. It’s not inevitable, but it’s possible — and biology shows us how. Change at the synaptic level supports change at the personal one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That truth is humbling — and empowering. The same brain that built addiction also built my recovery. The same plasticity that encoded fear also encodes courage. We are all, quite literally, wired for renewal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m still learning to live with change. But now, I embrace it. The question isn’t whether we change — it’s &lt;em&gt;what we change for.&lt;/em&gt; Nature changes by default. But progress? That takes direction. For me, the direction is clear: connection, discovery, service. Mentoring young scientists. Supporting others in recovery. Turning grief into fuel for compassion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ship of Theseus isn’t a philosophical puzzle. It’s a permission slip that says we are allowed to be rebuilt. Whether we’re recovering from trauma, loss, or addiction, every new plank is a testament to our resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biology gave us a mutable brain. Memory gives us the ability to steer it. Change is the cost of staying alive — and the gift that lets us become something better.&lt;/p&gt;

It transformed the lives of millions of people. People who could barely rise from a chair could stand, walk, and work again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The late Robin Williams famously &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1885331/#:~:text=Sacks's%20book%20Awakenings%20is%20a,and%20spread%20across%20the%20world." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brought the drug’s promise into public view&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990 movie “Awakenings.” For more than half a century, levodopa has been the gold standard for treating Parkinson’s disease, and the treatment is taught to medical students worldwide. Yet in 2025, most of the world’s 11.8 million people with Parkinson’s cannot reliably get it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in. A generic, off-patent medication that costs pennies a dose — one that can restore dignity, mobility, and independence — is out of reach for many people who need it. This is not because we lack the science. It’s because we lack the will, the systems, and the plan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve solved harder problems. Two decades ago, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the developing world. Lifesaving antiretroviral drugs existed but were locked behind high prices and weak global distribution. Through international coordination, policy changes, and sustained advocacy, we made those drugs available worldwide. Today, more than 29 million people are receiving treatment for HIV, turning what was once a death sentence into a livable and manageable condition. The hope is that the already implemented global systems and policies will sustain this success even with a decrease in funding from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why can’t we do the same for Parkinson’s disease? &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The barriers are depressingly familiar. In many low- and middle-income countries, levodopa is not on the shelves, or when it is, the supply is unreliable. Patients travel hours to reach a pharmacy, only to be told it’s out of stock. Counterfeit or substandard pills flood unregulated markets, leaving desperate families with medicines that don’t work. And when the drug is available, the cost can be crushing, forcing patients to choose between food and movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a supply chain problem. It’s a political and a moral failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease in the world. Its prevalence &lt;a href="https://pdplan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has doubled in the past 25 years and is set to double again&lt;/a&gt;. Yet unlike HIV or malaria, there is no coordinated global response. No multinational funding mechanism. No U.N. target. No accountability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we lay out exactly what such a response should look like: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make levodopa universally available and affordable.&lt;/strong&gt; Every country should add the drug to its essential medicines list, procure it in bulk at negotiated prices, and ensure consistent supply to all regions, rural and urban alike.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen distribution systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Governments and nongovernmental organizations must work with private suppliers to create reliable pipelines. That means better forecasting, secure storage, and safeguards against stockouts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure quality and safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Regulatory agencies must test and certify medications to block counterfeits and substandard batches. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate health workers and communities.&lt;/strong&gt; Many patients with Parkinson’s go untreated simply because no one recognizes their symptoms or knows levodopa can help. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor progress and hold leaders accountable.&lt;/strong&gt; We need transparent data on access, coverage, and outcomes, and the political will to act when targets aren’t met, just as we did with HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The global HIV response showed what’s possible when science, policy, and activism align. We built systems to deliver daily pills to tens of millions, across every continent, and have done so for decades. If we can do that for complex HIV drug cocktails, surely we can do it for a shelf-stable, safe, and well-tolerated oral tablet like levodopa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost is trivial when compared to the benefit. The return is enormous: People who can walk to work, care for their families, and live without the indignity of an untreated disease. In purely economic terms, keeping people mobile reduces disability costs, caregiver burden, and lost productivity. In human terms, it restores lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are unnecessarily letting millions slip into disability. Imagine telling someone with HIV in the early 2000s that the drugs existed but it wasn’t worth it for society to deliver the medication to them. That is exactly the message we are sending to people with Parkinson’s today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a solvable problem, but solutions don’t happen by accident. We must demand them. We must push for levodopa access as a basic human right and add it to the global health agenda. We need to start now, before the wave of cases overwhelms strained health systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world once rallied to turn the tide of HIV. We can and must do the same for Parkinson’s disease. A pill that costs pennies should not be a luxury. And a life that can be restored should never be left to wither.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael S. Okun and Ray Dorsey are authors of the new book, “The Parkinson’s Plan.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dorsey has worked as a consultant to companies that market levodopa formulations, but not on projects related to the drug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;

These treatments attack both cancer cells and healthy cells, exposing patients to serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A team of scientists from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Porto in Portugal have just brought an alternative one step closer. They’ve developed materials capable of converting near-infrared light, or NIR, efficiently and safely into heat that can be highly targeted against cancer cells. Their materials are tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoflakes, tiny particles that have a thickness of less than 20 nanometers (a nanometer is one-thousand-millionth of a meter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The team’s findings, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03135"&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/a&gt;, offer new hope for the design of photothermal therapies, the name given to these types of light-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A photothermal therapy is a noninvasive procedure that heats up cancer cells in order to destroy them. It works by infiltrating cancer cells with materials that absorb light and turn it into heat—in this case, the SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflakes—which can be designed so that they accumulate specifically in tumor tissues. They are then targeted with light at a wavelength that gives these materials the energy they need to produce cancer-killing heat but which doesn’t damage healthy tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers propose that their SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflakes could improve these types of treatments by offering greater thermal efficiency, biocompatibility, and affordability than other materials that are used in such processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible,” said Jean Anne Incorvia, a UT professor of engineering and one of the project leaders, in a &lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2025/10/09/led-light-blasts-cancer-cells-and-spares-healthy-ones/"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “With the combination of LED light and SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflakes, we’ve developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To evaluate the thermal efficiency of their new material, the team developed a proprietary system based on near-infrared LEDs (NIR-LEDs) that emit light at a wavelength of 810 nanometers, which is safe for biological tissues. Unlike traditional laser systems, NIR-LEDs provide more homogeneous and stable illumination, reduce the risk of overheating, and require minimal investment. The entire experimental set-up, capable of irradiating up to 24 samples at the same time, cost approximately $530, making it an affordable and versatile tool for biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Results from beaming NIR onto SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-treated cancer cells have been encouraging. UT reported that in as little as 30 minutes of exposure, the method killed up to 92 percent of skin cancer cells and 50 percent of colorectal cancer cells. This was achieved without any harmful effects to healthy skin cells, demonstrating the safety and selectivity of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQTFVqcjBVUW9LcEtWODdyTUxSWU54U1p5RFZZcEJoUVY0LVJLVmxSVVVDVFBvSzdYNTA1NzBTMTZGUFp4NHBTZnpBZGc5VmhLTk1lRWxBekJBcng4Y0ZFZUdiYzRwMWxoZ0JvTUd0QUxRLVhoajA1N044ZWlJVHlUeTRwcjhLYlBhUk5IZWQ0MzUxdG4xeTRUYm83M211ckQ2QzZnbXh5Z1k</guid></item><item><title>顶级神经科学家建议进行3次锻炼，以自然“生长”新的脑细胞-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/top-neuroscientist-recommends-3-workouts-to-naturally-grow-new-brain-cells/articleshow/125082021.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping our brains young and healthy is just as important as keeping the body in shape. The good news: the brain does not need to be fixed; it can grow new cells and adapt throughout our lives, a process called neurogenesis. Neuroscientist Robert Lowe, who specializes in Alzheimer's treatment, explains that certain physical and mental exercises can stimulate the growth of new brain cells, helping to improve memory and overall cognitive function. Some of the most effective and science-backed workout options are resistance training, dual-task exercises and leg exercises. Let us look at each one by one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resistance Training: Improves strength and brain power&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training includes various forms of exercises where muscles work against an external force, such as free weights, resistance bands, or body weight. Neuroscientific studies show that resistance training can boost BDNF levels, thus stimulating the birth of new neurons in critical brain areas, including the hippocampus hub of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical resistance exercises include weight lifting, squats, lunges, push-ups, and resistance band workouts. With this form of exercise done consistently, muscles are not the only things being developed; cognitive function is also enhanced through increased neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to adapt and make new neural pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that even moderate resistance training, done two to three times a week, can produce remarkable positive effects in the brain's health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, resistance training combats age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) and supports mobility, therefore minimizing the risk of falls and brain injury that could impair cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dual-task exercises: Challenges mind and body simultaneously&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exercises that combine two of our senses: Physical and mental, both, meaning training the body and brain at the same time. These workouts require both concentration and coordination, which makes them particularly effective for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of multitasking specifically activates brain networks responsible for attention, coordination, and executive functions uniquely. Neuroscience research showed that these trainings, since they require an active involvement of multiple brain regions simultaneously, are more effective in enhancing neurogenesis compared to physical or cognitive training alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mental challenge with physical movement thus results in higher production of BDNF, stimulating synaptic plasticity and enhancing the development of strong neural networks that are necessary to enable advanced thinking and memory. Dual-task training is particularly effective in older adults in terms of delaying cognitive decline and enhancing functional independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leg Exercises: Big on brain benefits &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workouts that focus on legs such as squats, lunges, climbing stairs etc, are powerful for our brains. That is because they engage some of the most largest muscles of our body, when these muscles contract, they send strong biochemical signals to our brain, helping boost NDNF production and support the growth of new brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking or jogging, while famous for its cardiovascular benefits, also serves to increase blood flow to the brain, carrying oxygen and nutrients critical for the growth and repair of brain cells. Dr. Robert Lowe identifies leg exercises as a key component of his recommendations on brain wellness because they maximize systemic effects that are beneficial for brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides promoting brain development, exercises of the leg improve balance, coordination, and endurance-all of which indirectly contribute to brain health because they reduce injury risk and foster an active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to incorporate these exercises into our routines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists recommend the regular inclusion of all three types of exercises to maximize the growth of brain cells and cognitive benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance is recommended at least twice or thrice a week. These exercises include: squats, deadlifts, lunges etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice dual-task exercises daily or several times a week: Examples of those are balance poses, Rober Lowe personally recommends a fun way, like walking and talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leg-focused exercises daily, including brisk walking, stair climbing, or squats that engage both muscular and cardiovascular activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such exercises do more than just build muscle and aid in strength. They also create an environment that allows the brain to grow new cells, enhance neural connections and maintain plasticity of the brain. Even in some cases, it protects us from diseases such as Alzheimer's or any injury to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo

class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Specialists from the University of Nottingham's school of pharmacy and department of chemical and environmental engineering have been working with researchers across the world to strengthen enamel and prevent tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The protein-based substance "works by mimicking key features" used to make enamel develop in infants, the university said, acting "as a scaffold" for calcium and phosphate ions in saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Full findings from the research have been published in the

with enamel degradation a major factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Problems that can occur as a result of enamel decay include infections, increased sensitivity and tooth loss, which can be linked to more serious conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Though current treatments such as fluoride varnishes can relieve symptoms, enamel does not naturally regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Alvaro Mata, chair in biomedical engineering and biomaterials who led the study, said the new substance "can be easily and rapidly applied".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We are very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"[We] hope to have a first product out next year [and] this innovation could soon be helping patients worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A new gel that can help repair and regenerate tooth enamel could create "new possibilities" for treatment, scientists behind its development have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Specialists from the University of Nottingham's school of pharmacy and department of chemical and environmental engineering have been working with researchers across the world to strengthen enamel and prevent tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The protein-based substance "works by mimicking key features" used to make enamel develop in infants, the university said, acting "as a scaffold" for calcium and phosphate ions in saliva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Full findings from the research have been published in the scientific journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to the World Health Organisation, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oral-health" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;about 3.7 billion people suffer from oral diseases&lt;/a&gt;, with enamel degradation a major factor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Problems that can occur as a result of enamel decay include infections, increased sensitivity and tooth loss, which can be linked to more serious conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Though current treatments such as fluoride varnishes can relieve symptoms, enamel does not naturally regenerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Alvaro Mata, chair in biomedical engineering and biomaterials who led the study, said the new substance "can be easily and rapidly applied".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We are very excited because the technology has been designed with the clinician and patient in mind," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"[We] hope to have a first product out next year [and] this innovation could soon be helping patients worldwide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Paul Hatton, a professor of biomaterials science at the school of clinical dentistry in Sheffield and member of the British Dental Association's health and science committee, said: "Recreating natural enamel to repair teeth has been something of a 'Holy Grail' for dental materials scientists for many years, where this paper suggests an exciting breakthrough has been made."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 06:05:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, Type-2 diabetes was seen as a slow, inevitable progression, a lifelong condition that could only be managed, never reversed. But emerging evidence is turning that assumption on its head. Scientists are discovering that the key to controlling blood sugar may not lie in endless cardio or strict diets alone, but in something far more accessible and empowering: lifting weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type-2 diabetes, which affects over 460 million people worldwide, results from the body’s inability to use insulin efficiently, leading to chronic high blood sugar levels. Traditionally, treatment centred around medication and dietary restriction. Now, a surge of new research reveals that resistance training, from lifting barbells to simple bodyweight exercises, can drastically improve glucose regulation, increase insulin sensitivity, and even induce remission in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured resistance training can be as effective as aerobic exercise for improving glycaemic control, with added benefits for metabolism and muscle strength. The concept is simple yet revolutionary: the more muscle you build, the more efficiently your body manages sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why muscles matter in diabetes management&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle tissue acts as the body’s largest reservoir for glucose. When you engage in strength training, your muscles absorb sugar from the bloodstream and use it as fuel, lowering blood glucose naturally without relying solely on insulin. Over time, this process enhances insulin sensitivity, meaning your cells respond better to insulin’s signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the advantages go far beyond temporary sugar control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12175443/#Sec15" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research from Diabetology and Metabolic Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows that resistance training triggers biochemical changes in muscle cells, increasing the number of glucose transporter proteins (GLUT4) that move sugar into cells. This means that even at rest, well-trained muscles become metabolic powerhouses, helping stabilise glucose levels long after a workout ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists call this metabolic flexibility, the ability of the body to switch between burning carbohydrates and fats for energy. In Type-2 diabetes, this flexibility is lost. Weight training restores it, resetting the body’s metabolic rhythm and reducing dependency on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How lifting weights transforms the diabetic body&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physiological ripple effects of strength training are profound and measurable. Researchers found that just 12 weeks of moderate resistance exercise improved insulin sensitivity by 30 percent in diabetic adults. Another &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37493759/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;clinical trial published in Diabetologia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reported that participants who combined weight training with controlled nutrition achieved twice the improvement in glucose tolerance compared with those doing aerobic exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how weight training exerts its multi-layered influence on the diabetic body:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Improved glucose uptake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each repetition in a resistance workout stimulates muscle fibres to draw glucose from the blood. The process is insulin-independent, providing immediate benefits even before insulin sensitivity improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Enhanced mitochondrial efficiency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training boosts the number and activity of mitochondria, the energy-producing units inside cells. Efficient mitochondria mean better fuel use and reduced oxidative stress, both critical in preventing diabetic complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Hormonal balance and fat loss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance workouts elevate anabolic hormones such as growth hormone and testosterone, which help regulate fat metabolism and preserve lean mass. Lower body fat reduces inflammation and improves insulin function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Increased resting metabolism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscle is metabolically active tissue. Gaining even a small amount increases daily energy expenditure, helping maintain a healthy weight and reducing visceral fat, a major risk factor in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Better cardiovascular health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, lifting weights benefits the heart. It reduces blood pressure, enhances vascular function, and mitigates arterial stiffness, which often accompanies diabetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weight lifting versus cardio: What’s better for diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While aerobic activity like walking and cycling remains vital for cardiovascular fitness, studies increasingly show that relying on cardio alone may not be enough for those with insulin resistance. Participants who engaged in both aerobic and resistance exercise experienced the greatest improvements in blood sugar control, compared with those who did either form of exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination creates a synergistic effect: cardio helps burn stored glucose during activity, while weight training builds the muscular machinery that keeps sugar levels stable in the long run. Experts now recommend that individuals with or at risk for diabetes include at least two to three sessions of strength training per week, focusing on large muscle groups through compound movements such as squats, deadlifts, push-ups, and rows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For beginners or older adults, bodyweight exercises or light resistance bands can be equally effective. The goal is progressive overload, gradually increasing resistance to stimulate muscular and metabolic adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How strength training rewires the body’s metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a cellular level, resistance training acts almost like a metabolic reprogrammer. Every lift, press, and pull sends a cascade of biochemical signals through the muscles that alter gene expression linked to glucose regulation, fat metabolism, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was uncovered that contracting muscles release myokines, hormone-like proteins that communicate with the liver, pancreas, and brain to improve insulin signalling and suppress chronic inflammation. These myokines even influence the gut microbiome, fostering bacterial strains associated with better metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In essence, every training session becomes a full-body biochemical recalibration. It’s not simply burning calories, it’s rewriting how your body processes energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strength training as prevention and therapy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most promising finding from recent studies is that resistance training not only helps manage diabetes but can prevent it altogether. A 16-year longitudinal study published in PLoS Medicine involving over 35,000 women found that those who regularly engaged in muscle-strengthening activities had a 30 percent lower risk of developing Type-2 diabetes, independent of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This preventive power lies in how muscle mass buffers against age-related insulin resistance. As people age, they naturally lose muscle, which weakens glucose control. Lifting weights reverses this decline, making it one of the most effective anti-ageing interventions for metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health programmes are beginning to take notice. In the UK and Japan, diabetic prevention schemes now integrate community-based strength training sessions alongside nutritional counselling. These initiatives show that metabolic resilience can be built, not prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bigger picture: Redefining diabetes care through strength&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science is clear: Type-2 diabetes is not solely a disease of excess sugar, but of weakened muscle metabolism. The surprising path to remission doesn’t always start with medication; sometimes, it begins with a barbell or resistance band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;By rebuilding muscle, individuals reclaim control over their body’s most powerful glucose-regulating organ. For millions living with or at risk of diabetes, this discovery represents more than just exercise, it’s empowerment through strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

It’s not just a “smoker’s disease” non-smokers are increasingly being diagnosed too, thanks to air pollution, passive smoke, and genetic factors. The scary part? Early symptoms often feel harmless, a lingering cough, breathlessness, or fatigue that most people brush off. But catching it early makes all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month is about spreading awareness, encouraging regular screenings like low-dose CT scans for those at risk, and reminding everyone that quitting smoking really does save lives. Even better, lung health can bounce back with time, good nutrition, and clean air habits. So if you’ve been ignoring that cough or skipping your health checks, maybe November’s the perfect time to start paying attention,because your lungs are literally your life’s breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;8 yoga poses to improve lung capacity and strengthen respiratory muscles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We at TOI spoke to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Associate Director &amp;amp; Unit Head, Surgical Oncology, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Shalimar Bagh and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Chairman, Surgical Oncology, Andromeda Cancer Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the early warning signs and symptoms of lung cancer that people often overlook?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people dismiss the early signs of lung cancer because they resemble common chest or seasonal issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cough that lingers for weeks, mild chest discomfort, hoarseness, or breathlessness on routine activities can all be early indicators. Some may notice fatigue or recurrent chest infections. Even small traces of blood in sputum should never be ignored and need medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early stages, lung cancer is often hard to detect as the symptoms are considered to be minor. The symptoms include a cough which persists for more than three weeks, blood in sputum, shortness of breath without explanation, frequent chest infections, pain in the chest or back, changes in the voice, loss of weight, or tiredness. These symptoms should always be taken seriously, particularly by smokers or those living in polluted areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does smoking increase the risk of lung cancer, and are non-smokers equally vulnerable?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Both the experts say:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cigarette smoke contains thousands of harmful chemicals — many of which are carcinogens that damage DNA in lung cells. The longer and heavier a person smokes, the greater their chance of developing lung cancer. But non-smokers aren’t completely safe — prolonged exposure to air pollution, secondhand smoke, or genetic factors can also trigger cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the most effective ways to reduce the risk of developing lung cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most powerful step to prevent lung cancer is to quit smoking completely—there’s no safe limit. Avoid secondhand smoke, reduce exposure to air pollution and workplace chemicals, and keep your home well-ventilated. Use air purifiers, clean-burning fuels, and wear protective masks on high-pollution days. People with a history of heavy smoking should discuss annual low-dose CT scans with their doctor for early detection. Regular health checkups and vaccinations for flu and pneumonia further support long-term lung health. Striking out smoking and improving air quality together create a strong defense against lung damage and cancer," advise the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does diet, exercise, and overall lifestyle influence lung health and cancer prevention?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr Anadi Pachaury: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good nutrition and regular exercise make a real difference. Foods rich in antioxidants—like leafy greens, fruits, and nuts—help protect cells from damage. Physical activity keeps the lungs strong and supports better oxygen flow. Avoiding processed foods, alcohol, and polluted environments also goes a long way in preserving lung health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Arun Kumar Goel: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life that is well-balanced is the main factor to lung immunity. Include antioxidant-rich food such as fruits, green leafy vegetables, turmeric, and nuts in your diet and at the same time cut down on fried or processed foods. Dedicate 30 to 45 minutes for daily exercise which will increase your lung capacity. If you are at a healthy weight, restrict alcohol intake, and practice relaxation methods and deep-breathing exercises such as pranayama, then your lungs will be stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should ex-smokers do to lower their long-term lung cancer risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do not start smoking again and have yearly lung check-ups. People between 50-80 years old with a history of heavy smoking may consider getting low-dose CT scans. Along with this, eating healthy, staying active, and avoiding exposure to pollutants and smoke from others are some of the measures that can be taken. These actions will bring down the risk of lung cancer in ex-smokers and promote good respiratory health," recommends Dr Goel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even after quitting, it’s important to stay committed to a healthy lifestyle. Eat well, exercise regularly, and go for periodic health checks. Discuss lung screening with your doctor, especially if you smoked for several years. The body continues to heal over time—lung function and risk both improve steadily after quitting," advises Dr Pachaury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the biggest myths or misconceptions about lung cancer that you’d like to correct?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common myth is that lung cancer only affects smokers, but anyone can develop it — though smoking remains the leading cause. Non-smokers face risks from air pollution, secondhand smoke, and genetic factors. Another misconception is that quitting smoking doesn’t help once damage is done, which is completely false. The benefits of quitting begin within weeks, and the risk keeps dropping every year. Early detection offers the best chance of cure, and newer therapies continue to improve survival. Persistent cough or breathlessness should never be ignored, and no herbal remedy can reverse the DNA damage caused by smoking, say the experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 03:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwJBVV95cUxNY2RQVFd1ZVlzdHRSQTQ4TEJjbGQzLW5QWUd2TFNLSWh1Tm5sUzloVllLUmFKTUFpeEF3RkVSVkM1WWZ0THBKOTdNNWNoOGZySDREejBpVXdYV1ZKUkNMeWpGZ2NsWHJxWng4QnJBWWpsbXg5cFdfZzlxUzlfdVVQMFNfbVQ1Q01kaDFHZk5ITG5OYl94UHI3Z0g0c2ZlNkNTVzVHWEFtcHBnZVYxQ3htVnd3YWhDdjgyclRLLTEyUWJBbERWWEZRMnJic2kwdWZaNC1DNFZsam41TmdURHNTM2RpSG5tbWhGb01yeGwyR2M3NlhfZVFDTmxSeG5FRGROanNqdzhTbTdicHdlblp2WFFlUkxsVmxDNERhcnczT0FEZEFQZmtF</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，分区可能是您大脑的冲洗周期- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/zoning-out-may-be-your-brains-rinse-cycle-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;We're all familiar with the feeling of zoning out, especially when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-dangers-of-sleep-deprivation-are-very-real-expert-warns"&gt;we're sleep-deprived&lt;/a&gt;. A new study suggests these brief wanderings of attention are our brain's attempts to catch up on maintenance that usually happens while we snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), used brain measurements taken by both electroencephalogram (EEG) caps and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scanners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Periods of zoning out – or "attentional failures", in the words of the study – were accompanied by a wave of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-vital-fluid-protects-your-most-important-organ-what-happens-if-it-fails"&gt;cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; (CSF) flowing out of the brain, before it returned a second or two later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;Fragments of Bacteria in Our Gut May Lull Our Brains to Sleep at Night&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patterns matched the waves of CSF that usually happen during &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;. The thinking is that this nightly fluid flow helps wash away waste products that build up during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn't see them," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Laura Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, they come with an attentional trade-off, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179946" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CerebralSpinalFluidFlowWhenAwake-642x314.png" alt="A graph with two lines, one red and the other blue, charting fluid flows in the sleep-derived versus well-rested brain.

(Yang et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study participants were each tested twice: after a night of restful sleep and after a night in the lab with no sleep at all. Unsurprisingly, their &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superager-brains-defy-cognitive-decline-we-finally-know-their-secret"&gt;cognitive performance&lt;/a&gt; during the study tests was generally worse when they hadn't gotten any shut-eye the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While zoning out occasionally happened &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;after a full night's slumber&lt;/a&gt;, it was much more common after the participants had stayed awake all night. It's almost as if the brain is trying to catch up with a burst of microsleep, at the temporary cost of your mind's focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179832" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179832" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow.jpg" alt="Brain scan charts" class="wp-image-179832 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CSFFlow-600x493.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179832" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at CSF flow and periods of zoning out ("omissions") after a full night of sleep and after a night of no sleep. Higher flows were recorded when reaction times slowed down (C; data from one test run is shown). (Yang et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Neurosci.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Zinong Yang, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your brain's fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that sleep is absolutely essential to our health and well-being. Missing out on these periods of rest increases &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sleep-deprivation-can-be-deadly-here-s-what-sleeping-less-than-7-hours-per-night-does-to-your-body-and-brain"&gt;our risk of disease&lt;/a&gt;, causes impairments in certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-found-an-alarming-pattern-in-the-brains-of-sleep-deprived-kids"&gt;parts of the brain&lt;/a&gt;, and changes our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/being-sleep-deprived-actually-changes-the-way-we-see-other-people"&gt;perspective on the world&lt;/a&gt;. And this study shows some of the ways the brain tries to catch up with missed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the outflow and influx of CSF was the most notable physiological change accompanying attentional failures, the researchers also found that breathing and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-hidden-pattern-in-your-pulse-could-signal-future-cognitive-decline"&gt;heart rate slowed&lt;/a&gt;, and pupil size got smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn't investigate these findings in much detail, but have a hypothesis that periods of zoning out may affect the body as a whole, possibly managed by a single control system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest to us," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/your-brain-without-sleep-1029"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Lewis, "that there's a unified circuit that's governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain – our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world – and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02098-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though individual needs may vary, chronic sleep deprivation, while sounding harmless, can over a period of time, lead to a host of health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, depression, high blood pressure, stroke, and heart disease. Dr Kunal Sood, Double Board Certified MD, in a video spoke about how even one night of poor sleep can play havoc with your immune system and how can one restore it…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How less is too less&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Amit Sood in the video, underscores that sleep serves as the cornerstone of a healthy system. Nabbing four hours or less of shut‑eye in a night, does more than leave one groggy; it gnaws at the system’s ability to fend off pathogens. The cells responsible for fighting viruses and bacteria become less active, making the body more vulnerable to illness. As we sleep, the body manufactures proteins and cells, so a deficit in rest, translates into a noticeable dip in those natural defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Easy home remedies to get rid of headaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What goes on in the body when you don’t sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even one night of poor sleep changes the way immune cells behave, according to Dr. Sood and supporting research. According to Dr Sood, Killer (NK) cells, who destroy infected or malignant cells, appear to lose a sizable portion of their effectiveness after only four hours of rest, and the data consistently show a dip in NK cell activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, sleep loss fuels a rise in messengers called cytokines; when these linger at elevated levels, they can set the stage for long‑term hazards such as heart disease. Together, these findings underscore how sleep and immune balance are intertwined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How sleep boosts memory&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep also gives the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3256323/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; system a chance to ‘remember’ viruses and bacteria it has already fought-a phenomenon known as immune memory. Think of it like children getting high fever over and over again, while growing up. Eventually, the number of instances of getting a fever go down, since your body has built up immunity over them, and most of the times, you won’t even realise that you have had a low grade fever, since the body has already fought that for you. This occurs because while the body rests, immune cells tighten those ‘records’, much like the brain consolidates memories during sleep. This sharpening lets the body mount a response the next time the same germs try to break in. The result is also a boost in vaccine effectiveness, which helps protect health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The good news? Your immune system can bounce back&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sood however, makes it known that a single night of sleep isn’t going to cause lasting damage. When you get back into a regular sleep routine, your immune system can rebound. The data show that after you make up lost rest, immune cells function better and inflammatory markers drop. In short, consistently prioritising sleep, lets your body repair, defend itself more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The far‑reaching health repercussions of &lt;keyword id="30224863" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="chronic-sleep-loss" source="keywords"&gt;chronic sleep loss&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/307334" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;deprivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; does more than merely sap the system; it rattles facets of both physical and mental health. When sleep is scarce, the brain operates at a poor capacity- because of this, concentration wanes, learning becomes laborious, and emotional regulation falters. The shortage also throws hormone production off balance, upsetting the signals that govern appetite, stress and growth, which can set the stage for weight gain, heightened diabetes risk, and cardiovascular disease. Persistent lack of sleep fuels inflammation across the body, sowing the seeds for a host of health problems. Hence, solid sleep is a cornerstone of health, and not a boost for immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="23766149" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="sleep-hacks" source="keywords"&gt;Sleep hacks&lt;/keyword&gt; that give your immune system a boost&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sood says that putting sleep at the top of the priority list, is a way to give your system a boost. To lift the quality of your sleep, try these suggestions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;li&gt;• Seek seven to eight hours of restorative sleep, per night.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;• Keep a sleep timetable-heading to bed and waking at the same hour each day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;• Leave bright lights off before hitting the sack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;• Cut back on caffeine, for at least 6 hours prior to sleeping. Avoid meals after dark, or at least 3 hours before sleeping. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;• Dim the lights, and switch off the sounds. Keep the room cool for sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 02:27:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgJBVV95cUxNZHJxMnR5Z1lteTZ6cmUtc29sZng5dklGdVhpNXhjS19fZzR0VTNrcnV3R3hhR2owZEY4OV92dlhZbm00bkQ0VENBalFQc2ItSGNJZmwwWGE0S3pBMUlrOTVDMW1uMWlwa256anFTNTJFY1c0SFJJR0ZfdWw0MFpQR3FQcEJaRXp6ZXBtaEd1S1BSUEVPZzdTQ3dnekFTUzVLZ29rZkp6eXVpRjJ4OTJyQm5wR0pkYm5qazE0NUFBZFBiQTZuS2l2TjZfUU5TWmVYcGt3S3dUVFd5bXVzUkx3UWdGUUZmRDJabTk0X0drZFJzczZGdG9zTHI5YS1VS3FsS1V0bWZuMnhtQVRQQnNxeWM2TWlBVklDQ3dnQ2N6X0hLcEhxZDA4aGk5U3oyeGl3RkE</guid></item><item><title>亚利桑那州12岁的孩子在捣蛋时昏倒，后来死亡。他的家人正在将悲剧变成希望。- 12News</title><link>https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/valley/arizona-12-year-old-collapses-while-trick-or-treating-later-dies-but-his-north-phoenix-family-is-turning-tragedy-into-hope-organ-donor/75-c6f3a8b1-8239-45cd-8232-6a87966f53c3</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;While trick-or-treating with friends, Dylan Skalina suffered an aneurysm and later died.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX — A North Phoenix family is mourning the loss of 12-year-old Dylan Skalina, who &lt;a href="/video/news/local/valley/valley-12-year-old-collapses-during-trick-or-treating-later-dies-of-brain-bleed/75-fd921cf3-20fd-494c-9311-2b555d807723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;died after suffering a fatal brain aneurysm on Halloween&lt;/a&gt; night—but even in their grief, they are finding ways to give others hope.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan had just finished trick-or-treating with friends on Friday when he suddenly collapsed. He was rushed to Phoenix Children’s Hospital, where doctors discovered a devastating brain bleed. Despite their efforts, Dylan died on Nov. 1.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was so loved,” his mother, Megan, said. “I knew we were loved, but I didn’t realize how strong of a bond he had with all of his friends.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends and classmates visited Dylan’s bedside in his final hours to say goodbye to the boy many describe as kind, selfless, and full of joy.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan lived with Type 1 diabetes and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that also affects his sisters, Alexis and Kaylie. The family believes the condition caused Dylan’s muscles to hyperextend inside his brain, triggering the fatal aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My legs hurt because of Ehlers-Danlos, like my muscles hyperextend. If my muscles hyperextend, I can't move my leg for like a minute until they go back," Alexis said. "It's a thing that you have to live with every day."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though their loss is unimaginable, the Skalina family is finding strength in knowing that Dylan’s life will continue to make a difference. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His pancreas will be used for diabetes research, a cause he cared deeply about, and his organs and tissues will be donated to help others. Doctors estimate his gift could save or improve the lives of more than 300 people.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He used to joke that he had a ‘bum pancreas,’” his mother recalled. “But now they can use it to help find a cure for Type 1 diabetes—one of his biggest goals in life.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday morning at Phoenix Children’s Hospital, staff and family members will hold an Honor Walk for Dylan: a solemn tribute to organ donors who give the gift of life to others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s so important to him,” Megan said. “I know he’s watching and realizes how many people he’s going to help.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Dylan’s selflessness, his family hopes others will learn about Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, organ donation, and the power of one young life to change so many others.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The Virginia Department of Health is also reporting significant increases in emergency department and urgent care visits for hand, foot and mouth disease. Compared with previous years, in Virginia and West Virginia, there has been a notable increase in reported outbreaks, with schools and day care centers accounting for the majority of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;SEE ALSO:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/150-unvaccinated-students-south-carolina-quarantining-measles-exposure/17998234/"&gt; Over 150 unvaccinated students in South Carolina quarantining after measles exposure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease, and what causes it? How is it spread? What are the symptoms, and how long do they last? Can adults also get it? How is it diagnosed and treated? Should parents keep children home from school or day care when they have it? What steps can families take to help prevent infection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University, previously served as Baltimore's health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;What is hand, foot and mouth disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious viral illness that primarily affects infants and young children. It's caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, most commonly coxsackievirus A16. It is not the same as foot-and-mouth disease, which affects farm animals like cattle, sheep, pigs and goats and does not infect humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease gets its name from the small blister-like sores it causes on the hands and feet and inside the mouth. While the illness can be uncomfortable, it is generally mild and resolves on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;How is it spread, and who is most at risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease spreads very easily through close personal contact and contaminated surfaces. A person can become infected after being exposed to droplets released when someone with the illness coughs, sneezes or talks. It can also spread through touching an infected person, such as during hugging, kissing, or sharing cups and utensils.&lt;br class=" "&gt;The virus is present in stool as well, so changing diapers or helping a sick child in the bathroom can lead to infection if hands aren't washed thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It can also spread when someone touches objects or surfaces like toys or doorknobs that have the virus on them, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth. Rarely, people can become infected by swallowing contaminated recreational water, such as from a pool that hasn't been properly treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Young children are most at risk because their immune systems are still developing, and they are more likely to struggle with personal hygiene and share toys and have close contact with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; What are the symptoms, and how long do they last?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;The first sign of the disease is usually a fever, followed by a sore throat and a general feeling of being unwell. These flu-like symptoms typically start three to five days after catching the virus. A day or two later, small painful spots can develop inside the mouth, often on the tongue, gums or inner cheeks. These spots can turn into tiny blisters or ulcers, making it uncomfortable for children to eat or drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Around the same time, a rash can appear on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the buttocks, legs or arms. The rash may look like flat red spots or small bumps that can form blisters, but it typically doesn't itch.&lt;br class=" "&gt;Some children have the mouth sores without the rash, while others have the rash without any sores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Most cases are mild and clear up on their own in about a week to 10 days. During that time, it's important to keep children well hydrated, since mouth pain can make them less willing to drink fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Can adults also get it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, although it's much more common in young children. Because most people are first exposed during childhood, adults often have some immunity. Still, anyone who hasn't been infected before or whose immune system is weakened can catch it through close contact with someone who is sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;When teenagers or adults do get hand, foot and mouth disease, symptoms are usually mild or may not appear at all. Some adults may have only a sore throat or mild rash without the typical mouth sores or blisters. However, they can still spread the virus to others, including young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; How is hand, foot and mouth disease diagnosed and treated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Health care providers usually diagnose the disease based on the characteristic symptoms and recent exposure to other sick children. A physical exam is typically enough to confirm the diagnosis. In rare cases, if the illness looks unusual or severe, the clinician may collect a throat swab or stool sample to test for the specific virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There is no specific medicine that cures hand, foot and mouth disease. Because it's caused by a virus, antibiotics do not help. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can reduce fever and mouth pain, and cool, soft foods or cold drinks can make eating and drinking more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Staying hydrated is the most important part of care, since mouth sores can make swallowing painful and dehydration can develop quickly in young children. Most cases clear up on their own without complications, but parents should contact a doctor if a child cannot keep fluids down, has a high fever lasting more than a few days or seems unusually drowsy or irritable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;Should parents keep children home from school or day care?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Because hand, foot and mouth disease tends to be mild, children don't need to stay home for the entire illness. The guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is that they can return to school or day care once they no longer have a fever, feel well enough to take part in normal activities, and can manage any mouth sores without excessive drooling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Parents should also check with their school or day care, since specific policies may vary. The CDC cautions that in some situations, such as during an outbreak, the local health department may ask families to keep affected children home temporarily to help limit further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; Are there steps families can take to help prevent infection?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Regular and thorough handwashing is one of the most effective protective measures. Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or changing a diaper, before preparing or eating food, and after blowing the nose or coughing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Covering coughs and sneezes, ideally using a disposable tissue or the crook of the elbow, can help stop the spread of virus-laden droplets. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces and objects. And people should also avoid close personal contact with infected individuals. This means no sharing of drinks, utensils, toothbrushes or towels, and keeping hugs or kisses to a minimum if someone is ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;The-CNN-Wire &amp;amp; 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

"One of my gym friends is on [weight loss] jabs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Baxi says he refused, asking him what he would do after losing 10kg on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Stop, and the weight comes back. Keep going, and without exercise you'll start losing muscle instead. These medicines aren't a substitute for a proper diet or lifestyle change," he told him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Such conversations are becoming increasingly common as demand for weight-loss drugs explodes in urban India - a country with the world's second-largest number of overweight adults and more than 77 million people with Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Originally developed to treat diabetes, these drugs are now being hailed as game changers for weight loss, offering results that few previous treatments could match. Yet their growing popularity has also raised difficult questions - about the need for medical supervision, the risks of misuse and the blurred line between treatment and lifestyle enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"These are the most powerful weight-loss drugs we've ever seen. Many such drugs have come and gone, but nothing compares to these," says Anoop Misra, who heads Delhi's Fortis-C-DOC Centre of Excellence for Diabetes, Metabolic Diseases and Endocrinology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Two new drugs dominate India's fast-growing weight-loss market. One is semaglutide, sold by Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk as Rybelsus (oral) and Wegovy (injectable) - while Ozempic (injectable) has been approved for diabetes in India but is not yet available for obesity. The other is tirzepatide, marketed by American drugmaker Eli Lilly as Mounjaro, primarily for diabetes but increasingly used for weight loss in India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Both belong to a class known as GLP-1 drugs, which mimic a natural hormone that regulates hunger. By slowing digestion and acting on the brain's appetite centres, they make people feel full faster and stay full longer. Taken once a week, most of these drugs are self-injected in the arm, thigh or stomach. They curb cravings - and in Mounjaro's case, also boost metabolism and energy balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/24a7/live/e2c24190-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Close up of a woman's hands holding a weight loss injection pen.

Prolonged use without exercise or strength training can also strip away muscle along with fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Also, not everyone responds to GLP-1 drugs, and most plateau after losing about 15% of their body weight. Side effects range from nausea and diarrhoea to rarer risks such as gallstones, pancreatitis and muscle loss. India's high-carb, low-protein diet already fuels sarcopenic obesity - the loss of muscle alongside fat gain - and weight loss without adequate protein or exercise can make it worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"With all the media hype and social media buzz, these drugs have become something of a craze among affluent Indians eager to shed a few kilos," says Dr Baxi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The frenzy, a Delhi-based physician recalls, was evident even at a recent medical conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Three months after the launch of a new drug, I'd treated about a hundred patients. A colleague said he'd done over a thousand - most using imported jabs bought on the black market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;India's anti-obesity drug market has surged from $16m in 2021 to nearly $100m today - a more than sixfold jump in five years, according to Pharmarack, a research firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Novo Nordisk leads the market with its semaglutide brands, with Rybelsus alone accounting for nearly two-thirds of the market since its 2022 launch, according to the firm. Eli Lilly's tirzepatide (marketed as Mounjaro), launched earlier this year, had become India's second-bestselling branded drug by September, according to Pharmarack. Each monthly injectable pen - four weekly doses - of these drugs costs between 14,000-27,000 rupees ($157–300), steep for most Indians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d401/live/c2552b70-b617-11f0-b309-2979cd77f516.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg via Getty Images A Public Health Foundation of India worker conducts a blood glucose test for a patient during a free door-to-door screening program funded by Eli Lilly &amp;amp; Co. at a home in the farming village of Thana kalan, Haryana, India, on Thursday, July 13, 2017.

Come March, the patent for semaglutide - the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy - expires here, potentially unleashing a flood of cheaper generics and making them more accessible. Jefferies, an investment bank, calls it a "magic pill moment" for India, predicting the semaglutide market could reach $1bn with the right pricing, uptake, and government incentives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"What we have heard is that nearly a dozen companies are already ready with generic versions of Rybelsus, the oral drug," says Sheetal Sapale, vice-president at Pharmarack. "But as affordability improves, the risk of misuse rises too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors tell stories of patients being put on high dosage of weight-loss drugs by gym trainers, dieticians and beauty clinics with no authority to prescribe them. Some online pharmacies are delivering drugs after a cursory phone consultation in the absence of a prescription. Beauticians offer "bridal packages" promising rapid slimming before the big day. There are fears of spurious medicines flooding the market. Federal minister Jitendra Singh has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2157298" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;"advised caution"&lt;/a&gt; on the new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"One patient asked me if these new medicines could help his daughter lose seven kilos before her wedding - in three months," recalls Dr Bhaumik Kamdar, a Mumbai-based chest physician. "He wanted to know if they really work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One challenge in India, doctors say, is the way people perceive obesity - and how that shapes attitudes toward weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Most don't realise that obesity is a chronic, relapsing disease," says Dr Muffazal Lakhdawala, a Mumbai-based bariatric surgeon.  "Many people with chronic obesity try crash diets, lose some weight, then regain even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Here, if you're overweight, people assume you're well-fed and affluent. We've gone so far in avoiding the elephant in the room that we've normalised it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Obesity, doctors warn, is a gateway to a host of diseases. "It's linked to at least 20 cancers, infertility, osteoarthritis and fatty liver - now one of the leading causes of cirrhosis," says Dr Lakhdawala. Yet, despite it affecting nearly one in eight people globally, there's still no universal consensus on how to define or classify obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The arrival of these drugs has changed the conversation - obesity is now being treated as a disease, not just a lifestyle issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Doctors across specialities are now turning to weight-loss drugs for more than just obesity or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5e/live/db052330-b88a-11f0-bff7-1f4f269bf265.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Two men performing squats with dumbbells in an open outdoor environment.

From just 200 procedures in 2004, the number soared to 40,000 in 2022 - a 200-fold rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Surgeons like Dr Lakdawala now run multidisciplinary programmes where patients on weight-loss drugs are first guided by endocrinologists, nutritionists, and psychologists for three to six months. "We don't hand out drugs casually," he says. "Those who don't respond to the drugs or have severe obesity are then considered for surgery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;His message to the growing number of urban Indians seeking quick fixes is blunt: "Don't use the drugs for cosmetic weight loss - use it for life-threatening weight gain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And for those chasing quick fixes to shed just five or 10kg?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He has simpler advice: "Cut out sugar - it's the biggest evil.

			&lt;p&gt;Specially engineered 'young' immune cells could help to reverse the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-critical-age-when-your-thinking-begins-to-decline"&gt;effects of aging&lt;/a&gt; and the damage to brain cells caused by diseases such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="179027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their natural state, these immune cells are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononuclear_phagocyte_system"&gt;mononuclear phagocytes&lt;/a&gt;, and they flow around the body, cleaning up waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we get older, however, these immune-cell cleaners &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imlet.2020.12.003"&gt;get a bit sloppy&lt;/a&gt;, clearing away less cellular debris and triggering more inflammation than before. Inflammation and protein aggregation are features of many age-related diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-in-the-brain-may-reveal-alzheimers-years-in-advance"&gt;including Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in the US produced replacement squads of mononuclear phagocytes, using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell"&gt;human induced pluripotent stem cells&lt;/a&gt; – starter cells that can be reprogrammed into many different cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-and-cancer-may-soon-be-treated-with-sounds-we-cant-hear"&gt;Alzheimer's And Cancer May Soon Be Treated With Sounds We Can't Hear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous studies have shown that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mice-hippocampus-enzyme-discovery-anti-aging-therapy"&gt;transfusions of blood&lt;/a&gt; or plasma from young mice improved cognitive decline in older mice, but that is difficult to translate into a therapy," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biomedical scientist Clive Svendsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our approach was to use young immune cells that we can manufacture in the lab – and we found that they have beneficial effects in both aging mice and mouse models of Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg" alt="Immune cells graph" class="wp-image-179030 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/LearningTask-600x608.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Older mice injected with 'young' immune cells (Aging iMP) performed as well as younger animals (injected with saline as a control) on novel object location tasks.

They help reduce damage and waste in the brain, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54779-w"&gt;become depleted&lt;/a&gt; in older brains and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-autopsies-revealed-a-potential-culprit-behind-alzheimers"&gt;those of people with Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another observed benefit was an increase in the number of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossy_fiber_(hippocampus)"&gt;mossy cells&lt;/a&gt; that help the brain's memory control center, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, function properly. Like microglia, these mossy cells can be hit by old age and Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The numbers of mossy cells decline with aging and Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist and lead author Alexandra Moser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did not see that decline in mice receiving young mononuclear phagocytes, and we believe this may be responsible for some of the memory improvements that we observed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers originally hypothesized that mononuclear phagocytes could be part of the reason that blood plasma and bone marrow transfusions have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.3569"&gt;the rejuvenating effects&lt;/a&gt; they do, and that idea was supported by the results here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the engineered immune cells that Moser and colleagues injected into mice didn't appear to reach the animals' brains, so the researchers figured the observed effects must be down to something produced by fitter, stronger mononuclear phagocytes circulating in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'young' cells may have released anti-aging proteins or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracellular_vesicle"&gt;tiny parcels involved in cell-cell communication&lt;/a&gt;, called extracellular vesicles, that made their way to the brain, reducing inflammation and boosting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques From Brains of Mice Within Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that most of the benefits observed here were in the older mice, not the mice engineered to display signs of Alzheimer's disease. There was also plenty of Alzheimer's-related brain damage, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;amyloid-beta protein&lt;/a&gt; buildup, that wasn't repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/human-brains-develop-in-unique-ways-that-explain-some-mysteries-left-by-mice-models"&gt;no guarantee we'll see the same effects&lt;/a&gt; in human brains either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those limitations, the early signs of this approach are promising. If derived from a patient's own cells, engineered mononuclear phagocytes could alleviate some of the drawbacks of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-new-blood-group-after-a-50-year-mystery"&gt;blood plasma&lt;/a&gt; transfusions and bone marrow transplants, so there's plenty of potential for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings show that short-term treatment improved cognition and brain health, making them a promising candidate to address age- and Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive decline," &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/young-immune-cells-could-treat-alzheimers-aging-symptoms/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Cedars-Sinai Medical Center neuropathologist Jeffrey Golden, who wasn't directly involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202417848"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

They just told me I have stage 4 pancreatic cancer.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three short weeks later, Mark lost a very short battle with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silent killer shows very few symptoms before diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say maybe 2-3 weeks prior to diagnosis.  His acid reflux had gotten tremendously more aggressive," Lynita said.   "He was belching more.  He had fatigue.  Then, like a week or two prior, we noticed bloating in his stomach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had no clue it would literally be three weeks from the time he was diagnosed to the time that he passed," Lynita said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO: &lt;a href="https://wset.com/news/local/mark-spain-beloved-abc13-anchor-and-community-figure-dies-after-battle-with-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Spain, beloved ABC13 anchor and community figure, dies after battle with cancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pancreatic cancer is rare; just 1.6% of us are at risk of being diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you don’t often see symptoms early on, according to Centra oncologist Dr. Susannah Cooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger." class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media2/16x9/1920/986/0x316/90/60c63b2f-9f81-4ffa-bf2b-db149c68e756-thumbnail_IMG_2085.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Mark Spain with his longtime anchor partners, Danner Evans and George Flickinger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think something that's really important to remember for pancreatic cancer or anything is that you really have to listen to your body," Cooper said. "I wouldn't ignore any symptoms.  Especially symptoms that persist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to symptoms like sudden weight loss, abdominal pain, clay-colored bowels or chronic diarrhea, jaundice, or yellowing of the skin or eyes, fatigue and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a family history of pancreatic cancer, genetic counseling can be a tool for early detection and treatment, according to Kelsey Newell, a genetic counselor with Centra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ideally, genetic testing would be offered to those patients very shortly after their diagnosis so we can try to get a better understanding of any genetic mutations they carry that can help us be better informed of their treatment plan," Newell said.  "And identify targeted options for their therapy.  Also, provide that risk information to their family members."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgery to remove the cancer and chemotherapy can help survival rates, but only 15-20% of cases are diagnosed at an early enough stage to be treated before it's too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even when I started in oncology, we had very little treatments for pancreatic cancer," said Dr. Cooper ."Over the last 5-10 years, we've gotten better and better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper said they've come a long way in developing innovative ways to help survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We actually have medications that can block those mutations and work specifically to attack your tumor," Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Kunk, an oncologist at UVA's cancer center, said cancer vaccines are also in clinical trials right now to help cure more patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having those patients undergo the same chemotherapy and then injecting a personalized cancer vaccine as well as an immune therapy medication to help rev up one’s immune system  to recognize those cancer proteins and mount a response to them and go after and kill all of them," Kunk explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also risk factors for developing pancreatic cancer you should consider: cigarette smoking, obesity, physical inactivity and chronic pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor about potentially being screened if you are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)" class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media/e72c0a07-da0d-430a-b2ed-bb0cb87f15ff-large16x9_AnchorMarkSpain2.png?1652040520167"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;Anchor Mark Spain with his family (Credit: Mark Spain, ABC13)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lynita doesn't know when Mark's cancer started--just that his symptoms presented too late in the game to offer any chance of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was one of the most aggressive cases they had seen in a while," Spain said.

Reporting in the journal Neurology Open Access, the team also warned that people with&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;both gum disease and cavities are at an 86 per cent greater risk of a stroke compared with those who have good dental habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/flossing-your-teeth-once-a-week-cuts-risk-of-stroke-by-one-fifth-d8lcqbb3q" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flossing your teeth once a week ‘cuts risk of stroke by one fifth’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The latest study monitored 5,986 adults in their fifties and sixties, none of whom had suffered a stroke when the investigation started, over 20 years. After accounting for variables such as age, body mass index and smoking, which all affect oral health, they found that those who visited their dentist regularly were 81 per cent less likely to have the gum disease and cavities tied to serious cardiovascular events, such as fatal heart disease and stroke, which cuts blood supply to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This study reinforces the idea that taking care of your teeth and gums isn’t just about your smile; it could help protect your brain,” said Souvik Sen, a professor of neurology and lead author of the paper. “People with signs of gum disease or cavities should seek treatment not just to preserve their teeth, but potentially to reduce stroke risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Taking good care of your teeth could even reduce your risk of dementia. A study in Neurology found gum disease and tooth loss were tied to shrinkage in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that plays a role in memory and Alzheimer’s disease. There’s evidence, too, that the delicate bacterial balance in the mouth, known as the oral microbiome, may be implicated in memory loss and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a study of 115 midlifers published this year&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Anne Corbett, a professor of dementia research at the University of Exeter, found that certain types of bacteria in the mouth are associated with better memory, focus and attention, while others are linked to poor brain health and dementia. In future, she says, it could lead to the development of DIY tests to detect early signs that someone is at elevated risk of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/the-foods-to-eat-and-avoid-for-maintaining-healthy-teeth-mpbsw2jq8" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The foods to eat and the ones to avoid for healthy teeth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“The potential for profiling dementia risk through at-home sampling is exciting,” Corbett says. “It is possible that the [oral] microbiome could form part of a battery of tests that would be used for this purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Oral hygiene — brushing twice a day and using floss or interdental brushes — remains the most important step, but thinking beyond that with steps that can improve our teeth and gums is increasingly considered a powerful way to protect against disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“People see their general health as separate from their oral health,” Sikka says. “They don’t see the mouth as connected to the body, yet the mouth-body connection is extremely strong.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Here’s how you can improve the health of your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Make sure you get plenty of omega-3 fats in your diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.13"&gt;&lt;div id="30c4c9d4-a187-47cf-ba51-f1240d283fb5"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon have anti-inflammatory effects on the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;We are all encouraged to eat more fatty fish for general health, but many of us don’t realise that the benefits of the essential healthy omega-3 oils they contain extend to improvements in our oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Omega-3 fats found in oily fish such as salmon, sardines and mackerel have anti-inflammatory effects on the body,” Shahid says. “Some studies show that when people with gum disease take omega-3s alongside dental treatment, their gums heal a little better.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;One recent investigation in the journal Scientific Reports suggested that combining omega-3 supplementation with regular exercise had a potent effect on lowering inflammation and helping the immune system to fight off chronic tooth root infections. It also helped to protect teeth from bone loss. The NHS recommends we eat at least one portion of oily fish a week. “Other good sources of omega-3 fats include flaxseed and walnuts,” Shahid says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Take a daily beetroot shot and eat your leafy greens&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some beneficial oral bacteria are known to play a key role in turning nitrate to nitric oxide, which has been shown in numerous studies to relax and widen blood vessels and improve blood flow around the body, including to the brain. Research by Anni Vanhatalo, professor in the faculty of health and life sciences at the University of Exeter, and Corbett has shown that eating plenty of nitrate-rich foods, including beetroot, can help with that process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In ongoing studies looking at the effects on oral health of taking a daily beetroot shot for 12 weeks Vanhatalo and Corbett have found that nitrate supplementation causes changes in mouth bacteria that are associated with healthier blood vessels and brain function as we age. They have also seen that levels of many harmful species of bacteria linked to inflammation decrease when beetroot shots are consumed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“We have shown that chronic nitrate supplementation [with beetroot shots] increases the proportion of nitrite-producing oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says. “This change is particularly beneficial in older people because as we age, our ability to produce nitric oxide via alternative pathways decreases.” Beetroot shots are one option, but leafy greens such as spinach, rocket and other salad leaves are also good sources of dietary nitrate. “We know that a nitrate-rich diet such as the Mediterranean diet or Dash diet is an effective intervention to reduce the proportion of potentially harmful oral bacteria,” Vanhatalo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Regularly exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Staying fit has benefits for your oral health, as a recent review in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care demonstrated. Dental researchers looked at the effects of regular intense physical exercise — running, cycling, swimming and competitive sports — and found that the physically active “have lower levels of inflammatory biological markers, which is linked to better oral health”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;They also revealed that regular exercise has a positive effect on salivary antigens, substances in saliva that can trigger a positive immune response, as well as improved oral muscle strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Exercise improves blood flow, lowers levels of inflammation in the body that exacerbate gum disease, and helps control conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure that can make gum problems worse,” Shahid says. “While a workout in the gym won’t clean your teeth, staying active supports the gums and tissues that keep them in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more expert advice on healthy living, fitness and wellbeing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Get plenty of fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Few of us get the recommended 30g of fibre a day that the NHS says we need for good health. We tend to think of fibre as improving our gut health and digestion, but its effects are far-reaching and by increasing our intake with more wholegrains, fruit and vegetables, we may inadvertently boost the health of our teeth and gums. A review by dental experts from Australia, New Zealand and India found that people who consumed 22-30g of fibre daily had less swelling of the gums, less plaque build-up and stronger tissues surrounding the teeth. It suggests “a fibre-rich daily diet may offer promise as a complementary approach for the prevention and management of periodontal diseases”, the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Crunchy foods such as celery, raw carrots and peppers promote oral health not just because of the immune enhancing antioxidants they contain, but because they physically scrub the teeth as you chew them. Think of them as nature’s own interdental brushes, Sikka says. “All high-fibre foods act a bit like a natural cleanser as they rub against your teeth when you chew,” he says. “In addition, the chewing they require stimulates saliva production, which, in conjunction with good brushing and flossing habits, helps to remove plaque from the teeth.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Eat cheese after a meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="3.33"&gt;&lt;div id="f2f1573e-c34a-417a-b1f3-38a2d47f51b0"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Cheese helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Cheese is good news for your oral health. “It is not only rich in calcium and phosphorus, which strengthen your tooth enamel, but cheese also helps to neutralise acid levels in the mouth,” Sikka says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Consuming a small piece of cheese after eating acidic foods or drinks — ultra-processed foods and fizzy drinks — can help to raise pH levels in the mouth, reducing levels of bacteria that over a long term can lead to decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In a small trial at Western Kentucky University researchers gave participants 28g of mild cheddar 60 seconds after they had sipped some cola. Tests showed that the cheese helped to “provide a protective shield around the teeth that fights the release of acids”, the researchers wrote. Cheese also increases the flow of saliva, preventing bacteria from sticking to tooth surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;Consider a deep-cleaning treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Data from the latest Adult Oral Health Survey commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care suggests that in England 19 per cent of adults and up to 28 per cent of those aged 55-64 said they had been told they had gum disease. Gum disease can be treated on the NHS — national guidelines include deep cleaning under local anaesthesia as part of the programme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Dr Marco Orlandi, honorary associate professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, recently published findings of a two-year clinical trial in the&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;European Heart Journal that found that this type of deep cleaning can reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease by 10 per cent each year compared with those who underwent a routine scale and polish. By reducing the amount of gum inflammation and bacteria entering the bloodstream, the deep cleaning helped to slow the thickening of the carotid arteries, the blood vessels supplying oxygen to the brain, face and neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Our trial did not include measures of cognitive function,” Orlandi says. “But it is plausible that arterial changes could support a modulation of the risk of neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

officials are warning residents to be cautious after confirming the county’s 15th case of rabies so far this year - a sharp increase after more than a decade without a single reported case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the Suffolk County Department of Health, 14 of the rabies cases have been found in raccoons and one in a feral cat. Prior to 2025, the county had not recorded any cases since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;For dog owner Tracy Sledge, of Amityville, the news hits close to home. She says she’s taking extra precautions when spending time outdoors with her 14-year-old dog, Agape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“It’s scary. I don’t want my dog getting anything. He’s old,” Sledge said. “I don’t want him catching it or getting anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Veterinarians say rabies is a serious threat to both animals and humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Dr. Michel Selmer, of Long Island Veterinary Specialists, stressed the importance of keeping pets’ vaccinations current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“It is super important for everyone to make sure their pet is vaccinated for rabies,” Selmer said. “It’s the only way we can control the disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Selmer also advised residents to stay alert for raccoons behaving abnormally — especially those seen wandering in daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;To combat the spread, county officials have been placing rabies vaccine bait pouches in communities. Most of the recent cases have been concentrated in Amityville, with others reported in Deer Park, Lindenhurst and Wyandanch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;If a pet happens to eat one of the vaccine bait pouches, officials say it’s typically not harmful - but owners should notify their veterinarian and watch for signs of stomach upset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health authorities continue to remind residents that rabies is preventable through vaccination and awareness. Anyone who encounters a wild animal acting strangely should report it to local animal control immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2025 22:47:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMEJ3TG5NQWFRb19QLTAwejNjazRObUJUU2VCNXJGSFFTcV9ReFVLVW5PTlh2dnFhTmVXWmQxTEEzN19NdzdvU0N1eEFJR2w0bHZFbjVaN3pkdDBaTjRBdjBvU2dVbDBUT0ZyR05lV1hQVWVrZlhxWE14QVJMRjBISmRJWjlxLXMydjZpRHVNWQ</guid></item><item><title>你的饮食让你闻起来性感或恶心你吃的一切都会影响你对他人的气味，结果很疯狂。最大的惊喜？大蒜让你的呼吸恶心，但你的腋窝汗水无法抗拒。研究人员让42名男性穿着- X</title><link>https://x.com/MarioNawfal/status/1985477085943505305</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-175oi2r r-1awozwy r-q4m81j"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-1qd0xha r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;Something went wrong, but don’t fret — let’s give it another shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;input name="failedScript" type="hidden" value=""&gt;&lt;button type="submit"&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0 r-1qd0xha r-q4m81j r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-b88u0q"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt;Try again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;div dir="ltr" class="css-146c3p1 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-1qd0xha r-a023e6 r-rjixqe r-16dba41 r-1oifz5y r-z2wwpe r-jwli3a r-6koalj r-1gs4q39 r-1ez5h0i r-11c0sde r-iphfwy r-o59np7 r-qjj4hq r-1h8ys4a"&gt;&lt;img alt="⚠️" draggable="false" src="https://abs-0.twimg.com/emoji/v2/svg/26a0.svg" class="r-4qtqp9 r-dflpy8 r-k4bwe5 r-1kpi4qh r-pp5qcn r-h9hxbl"&gt;&lt;span class="css-1jxf684 r-bcqeeo r-1ttztb7 r-qvutc0 r-poiln3"&gt; Some privacy related extensions may cause issues on x.com.

In severe cases, it can lead to abscesses, perforation, or bowel obstruction, which could require surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age for developing diverticulitis is over 50, with studies showing mean ages of around 52 to 64 for diagnosed cases. But trends could be shifting, the new study shows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From looking at more &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx"&gt;than 5.2 million&lt;/a&gt; hospitalizations included in the National Inpatient Sample, the researchers found a troubling surge in severe diverticulitis cases among Americans younger than 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that the proportion of younger patients admitted with complicated diverticulitis rose from 18.5 percent to 28.2 percent, a 52 percent relative increase over the 15-year period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, roughly 16 percent of the 5.2 million patients hospitalized for diverticulitis in that timeframe were under 50, classifying them as early-onset cases. Past research suggests the Western diet, with processed foods and a high red meat consumption, could be to blame for the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Diverticulitis is the inflammation or infection of small pouches called diverticula that form in the wall of the colon. It typically causes abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel habits (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the researchers in the new study noted that the reasons behind the rise in early-onset diverticulitis remain unclear, other studies have made the link to certain lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A large‑scale lifestyle and genetics study by Mass General Brigham in 2025 found that individuals with a healthier lifestyle (non‑smoking, a BMI less than 25, higher physical activity, higher fiber intake, lower red meat consumption) had substantially lower risk of diverticulitis, even if they had a high genetic predisposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile several studies, particularly a large-scale twin 2012 study conducted in Sweden, have linked diverticulitis to genetics, with estimates suggesting that 40 to 53 percent of the risk is heritable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study further highlighted differences between younger and older patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset patients generally had lower mortality rates, shorter hospital stays - about a quarter of a day less on average - and lower hospital costs, roughly $1,900 less per admission. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, younger patients were more likely to need invasive interventions, with 29 percent higher odds of a colectomy (a surgery to remove part or all of the colon) and 58 percent higher odds of needing the area to be drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colectomy is a surgical solution for severe, complicated, or recurrent diverticulitis, not a solution for all cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For milder cases, treatment typically involves antibiotics and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the proportion of younger patients undergoing colectomy decreased from 34.7 percent to 20.3 percent, suggesting that more cases are being managed successfully earlier on without surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author and fourth-year medical student at UCLA Shineui Kim said of this finding: 'While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they're paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Actor Josh Gad, 44, said using a GLP-1 drug for weight loss caused him to get diverticulitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that further research is 'urgently needed' to explore exactly what is behind the boom in early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study appears in the journal Diseases in the Colon &amp;amp; Rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend, the researchers said, mirrors similar increases in colorectal cancer among younger Americans, raising public health concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An investigation by the American Cancer Society (ACS) found that after a stable 15-year trend, diagnoses of local-stage colorectal cancer (CRC) rose dramatically in adults aged 45 to 49 years old between 2019 and 2022 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among this age group, cases were increasing one percent annually from 2004 to 2019, but that increase accelerated to 12 percent per year from 2019 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people 20 to 39 years old, CRC incidence has increased steadily by 1.6 percent annually since 2004 and by two percent and 2.6 percent annually since 2012 among adults 40 to 44 and 50 to 54 years old, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, from 2021 to 2022, there was a 50 percent relative increase in diagnoses, rising from 11.7 per 100,000 people to 17.5 cases per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This steep increase was driven by the detection of early, local-stage tumors, which increased from 2019 to 2022 by 19 percent per year for colon cancer and by 25 percent per year for rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Monica - who does not give her last name - found it difficult to get doctors to listen to her health concerns. The Australian, who is currently living in Croatia, was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last year when she was 31 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study's lead author Elizabeth Schafer attributed the rise in colon cancer diagnoses to new recommendations that lowered the screening age for the disease. A second ACS report found CRC screening among US adults 45 to 49 years of age increased by 62 percent from 2019 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended age to begin CRC screening was lowered from 50 to 45 by the ACS in 2018 and the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) followed suit in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early onset colorectal cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for men under 50 and the second-leading cause for women under 50 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 50,000 Americans are expected to die from colorectal cancer this year, while 150,000 are predicted to be diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
