                &lt;p&gt;Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman says one &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/daily-routines-successful-business-people-share-power-hours-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;morning habit&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in his overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.gq.com/story/andrew-huberman-diet-advice" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;with GQ&lt;/a&gt; published on Monday, the host of the popular "Huberman Lab" podcast shared the routines he's relying on to stay healthy in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Getting your physical health right — which puts your mental health in the best possible place — is all about intentionally high cortisol in the morning and intentionally low cortisol at night," Huberman told GQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cortisol has a bad reputation as a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/how-to-lower-cortisol" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;stress hormone&lt;/a&gt;, Huberman says it plays an important role in how the body transitions from sleep to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You want a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don't spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening, and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;One way to keep that rhythm on track would be to send the body a signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kate-hudson-morning-routine-phone-free-sunlight-outdoors-meditation-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;get bright light&lt;/a&gt; — ideally from sunlight — in your eyes in the first hour after waking. If you can't do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light," Huberman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that's not possible, he suggests flipping on "as many artificial lights as you can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've made a mistake in the past — a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake — by calling it sunlight&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; People say, 'It's overcast.' What we should say is, 'Get daylight in your eyes,'" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having dim mornings and bright nights is "the worst way to go," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Light exposure isn't the only thing Huberman says matters in the morning. He also encourages people to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/helen-mirren-aging-wellness-fitness-routine-exercise-military-workout-longevity-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fit in a workout&lt;/a&gt; if they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you don't have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to winding down at night, people should take the opposite approach, Huberman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you're going to exercise, don't make it terribly intense," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of getting light in the mornings are supported by broader research in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariana Figueiro, professor and director of the Light and Health Research Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, told Business Insider in 2023 that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-huberman-swears-by-morning-sunlight-healthy-circadian-clock-2023-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;getting daylight&lt;/a&gt; is "just as important as diet and exercise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Light in the built environment is not always strong enough to synchronize the biological clock," Figueiro said. "The beauty of daylight is that daylight is the right amount, it's the right color, it's on at the right time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, getting enough darkness at night is just as crucial, since circadian disruption has been linked to poor cognitive performance and a weakened immune system, Figueiro said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 2025 drew to a close, you were no doubt flooded with social media posts from your family, friends, work colleagues, and those randoms that somehow show up in your feed ‘cause the algorithm said so’. They were probably full of reflections on the year just gone, and full of hope for the year ahead. This time, they said, things will be different. A fresh start. A new them (funnily enough, that’s what last year’s posts said too). You may have made a similar post yourself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common of all new year’s resolutions is a commitment to improving physical and mental health. Working less. Sleeping more. Getting out on the bike more often. And of course, eating better. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the thing with new year’s resolutions, like most overly optimistic plans, is that they rarely survive contact with the real world. Those couple of weeks of blue-sky thinking in late December quickly make way for the sad realities of February; realities that were so obvious in hindsight yet completely overlooked at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this piece, we’re going to take a different look at nutrition-related new year’s resolutions, and leave you with some ideas that might help make dietary changes that survive to see the start of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"&gt;&lt;img src="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://escapecollective.com/content/images/2026/01/carson-arias-7zZLoemCauo-unsplash.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span&gt;New year, new you? Best to make sure your goals are realistic, and worthwhile. (Image: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/@carsonarias?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Carson Arias&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; / Unsplash)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-the-goal"&gt;What’s the goal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often where new year’s resolutions go to die. We’ve all set lofty, overly ambitious goals for our eating (or other lifestyle) habits, that in hindsight we never had a chance in hell of achieving. But it’s bigger than that. The number-one nutrition-related new year’s resolution that most people have, cyclist or not, is weight loss. Some people set modest, realistic expectations for what they might achieve. Others have goals of being leaner than they were in high school (20+ years ago, before kids and that sedentary desk job).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the level of ambition, I’m going to suggest that setting a weight loss goal is not the smartest approach to making dietary changes, for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being leaner, and becoming leaner, are two very different things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are those who are naturally on the leaner side, seemingly no matter what they do. Then there’s everyone else. And the concern here is not necessarily about being leaner, but about the process required for many of us to get there and stay there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in a caloric deficit can have many physiological and psychological consequences and the more aggressive and prolonged the deficit, the more significant these become. They can range from poor performance on the bike due to inadequate fueling for the training you’re doing, through to health effects, in both male and female athletes, summarised by the term &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/17/1073?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (REDs)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This can include loss of bone density, loss of menstrual cycle in females, suppressed testosterone in males, and much more. There’s been plenty written on REDs and cyclists in recent years so I won’t rehash it all here, but if you’re not so familiar with the term then &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/goodweekendmag/reel/DQ8tgiziXua/?hl=id&amp;amp;ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;this short reel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; featuring &lt;em&gt;Escape Collective’s&lt;/em&gt; own Georgie Howe provides a bit of insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note though that this is not an issue unique to elite or professional athletes. Any large mismatch between training load and calorie intake can potentially have these consequences, and I’ve seen variations of this in riders of all ages, sexes, and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

By comparison, the statewide average is 6.5 percent, and Hamilton County itself is at 6.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness can cause symptoms like fever, body aches, coughing and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Harrison, a Hamilton County resident, told us those are the same symptoms he felt when he says he was diagnosed with the flu in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I began to lose my ability to focus and continue engaged in the conversation," Harrison said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The fact that I got it at all, makes it seem worse than usual."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;State and federal health experts say the surge comes as influenza A(H3N2) continues to circulate widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chirag Patel, a pharmacist at Max Discount Pharmacy on Highway 58, told us local pharmacies and clinics are witnessing a surge in cases firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"We did not see that many flu cases last year and the previous year," said Patel. "This year, we already started early, around October, November, and now it's still going on. That's little bit red flag right there."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patel says detecting symptoms of the flu early can make a big difference in recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The first 48 hours after you having a first symptoms is really critical, Patel said."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC reports at least 11 million flu illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths nationwide so far this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One pediatric death was reported this week in Tennessee, bringing the season total to nine nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"&gt;&lt;img alt="File photo: Getty Images." class="ImageEmbed_image__qZBo_" src="/resources/media2/16x9/612/986/0x32/90/07914280-83d3-4e02-8d02-9ee7be6c56ef-flushots2.jpg"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_caption__gAtoE"&gt;&lt;p&gt;File photo: Getty Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia officials are also reporting higher-than-average flu activity, signaling that the region is experiencing a particularly active season. Health authorities encourage residents six months and older to get vaccinated if they have not already and to take precautions such as frequent handwashing and staying home when sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu activity is expected to remain elevated in Tennessee and across the U.S. for several more weeks, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local hospitals and clinics are urging families to monitor symptoms and seek care early, especially for children, older adults, and those with chronic health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest guidance on influenza vaccination and antiviral treatments, visit the Tennessee Department of Health or the CDC at cdc.gov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depend on us to keep you informed as we learn

class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS has selected nine different conditions in total for the service which will be available through the NHS app in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0

will have its own dedicated team of doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The aim is to carry out 8.5 million appointments in the first three years – four times more than the average NHS trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But experts have questioned how it will be staffed and paid for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The nine conditions that will be prioritised initially are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0

endometriosis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The expectation is more conditions will be added to this list in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;No patient will be forced down this route though, NHS England said, as they can still choose face-to-face appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients will have the option of using NHS Online when a GP makes a referral for specialist care. Instead of having a physical site, patients will be able to receive care from doctors around the country, directly through the NHS App.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Tests, scans or procedures that are needed will take place at healthcare sites close to patients' homes, while doctors review and assess their notes remotely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The government and NHS England believe the service will provide quicker access to care for patients and help relieve the pressure on in-person appointments, helping to cut waiting lists in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Health Secretary Wes Streeting insisted that "everyone will benefit" from using the online service, even if not using it directly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He told BBC Breakfast that those choosing to go online may be seen more quickly, freeing up space for those who want a face-to-face appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Professor Stella Vig, head of elective care at NHS England, said: "The NHS's new online hospital will see a huge shift in the way we deliver care, giving patients the option to have an online appointment with a specialist anywhere in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Regarding the nine conditions being prioritised, she said: "We know that these conditions can be painful and difficult to cope with so providing faster, more convenient access to diagnosis and treatments will have a real and positive impact on people's lives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Questions remain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Patients can already get test results on the NHS app and have online appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But this service builds on that by essentially offering a start-to-finish service digitally, building on some initiatives that have already been piloted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For example, University Hospital Southampton developed a virtual follow-up service for low-risk inflammatory bowel disease, enabling patients to access care and support remotely when they had flare-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It meant the NHS trust could cut back on routine follow-up appointments. Three quarters of patients were managed virtually and the initiative was credited in reducing waiting times by 58%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile, Moorfields Eye Hospital in London has introduced a virtual system for managing non-emergency eye referrals. More than half ended up being treated in routine clinics without the need for specialist treatment at Moorfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Moorfields Eye Hospital consultant Peter Thomas said: "The impact is clear – patients are being seen more quickly in more appropriate settings, and the pressure on NHS services is being reduced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Becks Fisher said, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said the service will be helpful for some and focussing on menopause and menstrual health "makes sense" given the long waits for gynaecology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But she added "tricky questions remain", including how the service will be staffed and paid for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She also said: "NHS IT infrastructure could also pose a problem, as it will need to enable relevant information – like scan results – to be seen across different NHS organisations, something that is infamously difficult at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/zhp28xs" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;Sign up here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 01:30:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFA1LVhvSHRDVlgwbDU1MzZ1Rlh0aG01cmtUWnY2QUh3MVpQbUFlNWtvMXFHUktqVVFwaGdvS245MUNLZTRTeHF3U0NkRjI5VTkzRXhfUVBOTk9DZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE92T2M1NUpTTUdKVlZvRE0zLXE1RWdlN2FwX2lPX0ZfeFFTQ1Fsem5LMmJ3bnBMTEN2WmdrU3FMNjZZSHRITUdERmk3TnJPdmJ2dzRKTzRYbm5TbE1QUHJN</guid></item><item><title>数以百万计的母亲细胞持续存在于您的体内，现在我们知道了方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/millions-of-your-mothers-cells-persist-inside-you-and-now-we-know-how</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Every human born on this planet is not entirely themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tiny fraction of our cells – around one in a million – is actually not our own, but comes from our mothers. That means each of us has millions of cells that our immune systems would normally recognize as foreign; yet somehow, in most of us, they hang around peacefully without causing any immune problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, immunologists have figured out why. A small number of maternal immune cells that cross the placenta during pregnancy actively train the fetus's immune system to tolerate the mother's cells for their entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-actually-have-secret-stripes-and-other-strange-markings"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Humans Actually Have Secret Stripes And Other Strange Markings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exchange of cells between a mother and a fetus is a well-documented phenomenon that scientists have known about for &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04102-4"&gt;more than 50 years&lt;/a&gt;. It's called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchimerism"&gt;microchimerism&lt;/a&gt;, and it goes both ways: every human who has ever been pregnant retains cells from their fetus, and every human retains cells from their mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lingering cells pose a puzzle for immunology, which is built around the idea that the immune system should mount an attack against foreign cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team led by pediatric infectious disease specialist Sing Sing Way of Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center wanted to understand more about how these foreign maternal cells keep the immune system in check, and what role they play in shaping the fetus' immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out, the researchers studied maternal microchimerism in mice. Building on their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adf9325"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers bred mice with immune cells engineered to express specific cell surface markers. This allowed researchers to selectively deplete those cells and see whether or not immune tolerance was maintained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's where it got fascinating. A small subset of the maternal immune cells, with properties similar to bone marrow myeloid cells and dendritic cells, persisted long after birth. They were also strongly associated with both immune activity and the expansion of regulatory T cells – the cells that tell the immune system that everything is copacetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To confirm, the researchers next selectively edited out those specific maternal cells in offspring mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were dramatic. The regulatory T cells disappeared, and the immune tolerance of maternal cells disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication is that lifelong tolerance to maternal microchimeric cells is probably dependent on just a tiny subset of maternal cells. Take those away, and immune chaos likely ensues. That also means that immune tolerance needs to be continuously and actively maintained; it's not a one-and-done process during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's interesting and exciting in its own right, but the research also offers a way to gain a greater understanding of the broad swath of diseases and conditions to which microchimerism may contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The new tools we developed to study these cells will help scientists pinpoint exactly what these cells do and how they work in a variety of contexts including autoimmune disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="187604" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and neurological disorders," &lt;a href="https://scienceblog.cincinnatichildrens.org/deeper-microchimerism-study-sheds-new-light-on-a-mothers-cellular-gift/"&gt;Way says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microchimerism is increasingly linked with so many health disorders. This study provides an adaptable platform for scientists to investigate whether these rare cells are the cause of disease, or alternatively, found in diseased tissue at increased levels as part of the natural healing process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2025.08.005"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Immunity&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Today, we’re talking about food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="g-wrapper  svelte-19s2qxj"&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Your brain is an energy hog. Despite comprising about 2 percent of the average person’s body mass, it consumes roughly 20 percent of the body’s energy. In other words, what you use to fuel yourself matters for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;So what foods are best for your brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4581900/"&gt;nine-year study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 1,000 older adults, researchers at Rush University in Chicago found that people who ate more of nine particular types of food — berries, leafy greens, other vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, fish, poultry and olive oil — and who ate less red meat, butter and margarine, cheese, sweet treats and fried food had slower cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Based on these findings, the researchers developed the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/31/well/eat/mind-diet-dementia.html"&gt;MIND diet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Large studies encompassing thousands of people have since shown that following the MIND diet corresponds with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37105521/"&gt;better cognitive functioning&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37133875/"&gt;lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17055-5"&gt;slower disease progression&lt;/a&gt; in people with Alzheimer’s. People benefit from the diet regardless of whether they start it &lt;a href="https://cdn.nutrition.org/article/S2475-2991(25)01953-5/fulltext"&gt;in midlife or late life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Experts think the foods included in the MIND diet are especially good for the brain because they contain certain macro and micronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Berries and leafy greens, for example, are rich in polyphenols and other antioxidants, said Jennifer Ventrelle, a dietitian at Rush and a co-author of “The Official Mind Diet.” Many of these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier and help to fight inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which can damage cells and are linked to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Nuts and fatty fishes, like salmon and sardines, contain omega-3 fatty acids, which are important for building the insulating sheaths that surround the nerve fibers that carry information from one brain cell to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Whole grains and beans both contain a hefty dose of fiber, which feeds the good microbes in the gut. Those microbes produce byproducts called short-chain fatty acids that experts think can influence brain health via the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;You don’t have to revamp your whole diet to get these nutrients. Instead, think about “MIND-ifying” whatever you already tend to eat, said Dr. Joel Salinas, a neurologist at NYU Langone Health and the founder and chief medical officer of the telehealth platform Isaac Health. For instance, add a handful of nuts or berries to your breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="g-text  svelte-19nwvmi"&gt;Today’s activity will help you MIND-ify your own meals.

Data for Nevada was “insufficient,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-579063" class="body-graf"&gt;Because the latest data is from the week of Christmas, it doesn’t yet reflect illnesses caused by holiday travel and gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fee0a" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s still too soon to know what the impact of the holiday season is going to be on flu activity,” said Krista Kniss, an epidemiologist in the CDC’s influenza division. “We’re not anywhere close to being done.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b659ff" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Nick Cozzi, emergency medical services director for Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said the flu is keeping his team “incredibly busy.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-afe97e" class="body-graf"&gt;“I see a lot of patients coming in with cough, runny nose, shortness of breath, diarrhea and bone-chilling body aches,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2355e0" class="body-graf"&gt;Compounding the problem, many patients are dealing with other viruses, like Covid or &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rsv-dangerous-babies-not-others-rcna56551" target="_blank"&gt;RSV&lt;/a&gt;, on top of flu, Cozzi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4666ac" class="body-graf"&gt;A significant number of patients, he said, are also having trouble breathing. “We’re admitting patients at a higher rate than we normally do,” he said. “Their oxygen levels are lower than normal, creating a potential situation which can be life-threatening unless they receive supplemental oxygen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-60acb3" class="body-graf"&gt;At Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, flu hospitalizations more than doubled in the last two weeks compared with the previous two-week period, said Dr. Emily Boss, director of pediatric otolaryngology at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8c66c" class="body-graf"&gt;“This rise is earlier than last year by about a month,” Boss said. “We don’t know yet what the peak will look like compared to prior seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-5962c9" class="body-heading"&gt;HHS no longer recommends flu shots for all kids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-37c63c" class="body-graf"&gt;The 2025-26 flu season, which is just getting started, follows the deadliest season for children since the CDC began tracking pediatric deaths. On Monday, the CDC reported an additional death of a child last season, bringing the total to 289, eclipsing even the number of pediatric deaths from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5ba2a7" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s too soon to know how harsh this season will be for children, although under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s guidance, the U.S. is no longer recommending that all children get annual flu shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-70e00a" class="body-graf"&gt;On Monday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-vaccines-overhaul-kids-denmark-fewer-childhood-shots-rcna250055" target="_blank"&gt;major overhaul of the childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;. Effective immediately, the administration said, the flu vaccine will be taken off of the official childhood vaccine schedule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8082f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“To back off on a flu recommendation in the midst of a pretty severe flu year seems to me to be pretty tone-deaf,” Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on infectious diseases, said on a call with reporters. “And that’s coming off an influenza year where we had the most childhood deaths from influenza in many years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-423612" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Monday afternoon, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt; still stated: “Everyone 6 months and older, with rare exceptions, should get a flu vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 23:07:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNQUd4cmcySHFQYi16R1VyRk51N2lFV0FQX0QtbFJpb1I3b2k1U3IyMGxtM0Y3VnQyTzFEXzdoT21JWkFiZk9FMTNKM1VvSHlheFVkR0Y1NzFpSXhaTzhoU2NDS2FWWEt6STduV29LejBMNjBvemhRckhsOTRKVEtoSTBNVDlGNGs0a0l2bmt3Y0hBcW00bVktWEowbVJoOXfSAVZBVV95cUxOa05oeUozRHBkRFlBMmNVbnhwWmc2N1g5WHhVUS1rdElWcXNkcjloUTFOSlhnMTJlaURYMzl4am82YS1weTVEc1dDRV9MV1JVUDdqUGdXdw</guid></item><item><title>Andrew Huberman正在优化土耳其辣椒-切割</title><link>https://www.thecut.com/article/andrew-huberman-goop-turkey-chili.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content inline" data-editable="content"&gt;

Luckily, Goop Kitchen is here to help. To kick off the New Year, Gwyneth Paltrow’s &lt;a href="https://www.goopkitchen.com/our-mission"&gt;seed-oil-free food-delivery service&lt;/a&gt; is teaming up with Andrew Huberman to launch a groundbreaking dish packed with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/fiber-life-changing-jeni-britton-floura-interview.html"&gt;everyone’s favorite macros&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.goopkitchen.com/winter-menu/hubermans-organic-turkey-chili"&gt;turkey chili&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmk1rk8gn00153b7bd4p2fpjh@published" data-word-count="162"&gt;Huberman — the Stanford University professor of neurology and ophthalmology &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/andrew-huberman-podcast-stanford-joe-rogan.html"&gt;turned longevity podcaster&lt;/a&gt; — has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/business/david-protein-bars.html"&gt;one of the loudest voices&lt;/a&gt; convincing Americans they need to eat way more protein. While many &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/04/25/well/eat/protein-meal-guide.html"&gt;nutrition experts dispute this&lt;/a&gt;, Paltrow has been “praying” for him to do a collaboration. So what’s in Huberman’s “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTIo2ZVj9aK/?hl=en"&gt;brain-supporting spin on chili&lt;/a&gt;”? It appears to be organic turkey, kidney beans, and a blend of spices. Not the most innovative recipe, but apparently the magic is in the proportions. “The meat-to-bean ratio in chili is crucial,” Huberman reflects in &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTIo2ZVj9aK/?hl=en"&gt;the promo video&lt;/a&gt; — you want enough to add some fiber but not so much that it’s “overly starchy,” Paltrow explains. Huberman adds that in the winter, he likes to eat hot foods. If you’re not sold yet, he also &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/andrew-huberman-diet-advice"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that, in his opinion, “the turkey chili doesn’t taste like turkey. It tastes a bit more like beef to me.” He likes to garnish his with pickled onions to support his microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;

But before you click “order,” it may be worth considering that Huberman &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20"&gt;once said on his podcast&lt;/a&gt; that he “doesn’t go anywhere near the food production” in his home “for everyone’s benefit.” Then again, that’s what New Year’s resolutions are for, right?&lt;/p&gt;

The device detects and amplifies brain waves, and neurological activity appears as wavy lines on the EEG recording. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 20 minutes into the test, however, the patient unexpectedly suffered cardiac arrest and died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ongoing EEG captured what Zemmar later realized was the first-ever recording of a naturally occurring human death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The surgeon's discovery has made him rethink what he knows about death&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Ajmal Zemmar and his team captured the first-ever recording of a dying human brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it recorded 900 seconds of the event, from before and after the main died, the most striking finding occurred 30 to 60 seconds after the man's heart stopped beating: the brain continued to produce gamma waves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gamma brainwaves are the fastest frequencies associated with peak mental performance, including intense focus, heightened awareness, learning, memory and integrating complex information. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zemmar, now based in&lt;span&gt; Louisville, &lt;/span&gt;Kentucky&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;explained that gamma waves are the same high-frequency brain oscillations also observed when living people recall or view highly memorable life events, such as the birth of a child, a wedding or a graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to rethink death,' said Zemmar, adding that we can find comfort in knowing that when a loved one dies, they are no longer in pain, but instead revisiting meaningful moments from their life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zemmar also stressed that producing gamma waves requires high-level brain activity, not something that occurs accidentally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It suggests that there's some coordinated activity going on,' he noted, adding that the discovery was a 'paradigm shift' from the Hollywood depiction of instant brain silence when the heart stops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The newly discovered pattern, according to Zemmar, also provided the first neurophysiological evidence supporting reports from approximately 14,000 near-death experience survivors who consistently describe a life flashback during clinical death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until this recording, no scientific mechanism had explained those accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it recorded 900 seconds of the event, from before and after the main died, the most striking finding occurred 30 to 60 seconds after the man's heart stopped beating: the brain continued to produce gamma waves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although initially cautious because the finding came from a single case, Zemmar said two additional human cases identified by a separate research group at the University of Michigan have since confirmed the same gamma-wave surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 2023, Michigan researchers found that two patients who were thought to be brain-dead experienced sudden bursts of brain activity after being taken off life support, the same gamma waves as Zemmar had observed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are three cases in humans now,' Zemmar said. 'It's not a lot, but it's something, better than none.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also suggested that the brain could be biologically programmed to manage the transition into death, potentially orchestrating a series of physiological and neurological events rather than simply shutting off instantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zemmar, who once adhered strictly to provable science, now believes reducing uncertainty around death can comfort both the dying and the bereaved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drawing on teachings from Vietnamese Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh about the 'seven bodies,' he noted that only the physical body departs at death, while other dimensions - emotional influence, inspiration and guidance - remain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The person who leaves us doesn't stop interacting and influencing us,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, Zemmar hopes the research helps humanity confront an inevitable experience with less fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Death affects every human,' he concluded. 'If we reimagine the way that death looks like and we try to find our comfort and our peace with that, I think those things may help humans to think about death in a different way.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts recommend washing your sheets once a week in the winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More time indoors and closed windows warrant frequent washing in winter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wash your sheets with a high-quality detergent and dry them thoroughly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A common theory suggests that you don't need to wash your sheets as frequently in the winter. There is certainly a logical explanation for this idea: colder weather might suggest less sweating at night and, therefore, less urgency to wash your sheets. However, according to industry experts, this idea is wholly inaccurate.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some sources suggest you can wash your sheets less frequently in the winter, based on the idea that people sweat less in the colder months. But laundry experts say this is only a myth. You should &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-often-should-you-wash-sheets-11733618" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wash your sheets just as often in winter as you do the rest of the year&lt;/a&gt;: every one to two weeks.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The 'wash less in winter' myth comes from people thinking they sweat less, but you're actually shedding dead skin cells at the same rate year-round," says Matt O'Connor, the co-founder and CEO at NoScrubs.com.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, thanks to more time spent indoors with closed windows, your bedding is likely harboring even more body oils, skin cells, and potential allergens than in other seasons.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Indoors in winter is a playground for allergens and irritants, especially dust mites and pet dander," says Tom Ceconi, president at Heritage Park Laundry.

&lt;ol id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose the right detergent.&lt;/strong&gt; "One of the biggest problems we face in the winter is dry skin that is prone to irritation," says Ceconi, who recommends avoiding any detergent or product that contains dyes, synthetic fragrances, or harsh chemicals. You might also consider a hypoallergenic detergent to help minimize issues from dry skin and allergens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/what-temperature-water-for-sheets-11704771" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;right water temperature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for your chosen detergent.&lt;/strong&gt; If you opt for a high-quality detergent, a cool or warm temperature is likely sufficient for washing your sheets. Otherwise, our experts recommend using half the detergent you think you need, paired with hot water (at least 130°F) to kill bacteria and dust mites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/top-uses-for-vinegar-in-laundry-2147286" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add white vinegar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to the rinse cycle.&lt;/strong&gt; Since many of us experience dry skin in the winter, this extra step can help reduce irritation from detergent-coated fabrics and dry skin. "It strips out detergent buildup better than fabric softener and won't leave that waxy coating that traps oils," says O'Connor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry thoroughly with a warm temperature and wool dryer balls.&lt;/strong&gt; Lewenhaupt suggests air drying whenever possible, but this can be challenging in winter, when temperatures are lower. Instead, &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/best-wool-dryer-balls-4781065" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;add a set of wool dryer balls&lt;/a&gt; to your dryer. "Tumble dryer balls increase air circulation, which shortens drying time and reduces static buildup," says Lewenhaupt. "Be mindful of using too high a heat, as that can cause shrinkage and damage the fabric."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block lifestyle-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always &lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/international-laundry-care-symbols-2146487" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;check the care label&lt;/a&gt; on your sheets and other bedding to ensure you use the correct washing and drying methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incorporate a vinegar rinse into your winter washing routine to reduce detergent buildup and minimize skin irritation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use wool dryer balls instead of fabric softeners or dryer sheets. This method will remove detergent buildup, avoid unnecessary chemicals, and speed up the drying time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use bleach, as it can agitate your skin and damage your sheets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thespruce.com/shake-method-for-laundry-8786710" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Shake your sheets well&lt;/a&gt; after the wash cycle to speed up drying time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever possible, skip the dryer and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-line-dry-clothes-indoors-1387951" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;air-dry&lt;/a&gt; your sheets instead. O'Connor recommends hanging them indoors near a heat vent or radiator (of course, abide by fire safety rules). Meanwhile, Ceconi suggests hanging them on a clothesline on a cold, sunny day (under a porch).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lewenhaupt recommends using a steamer in between or after washes to remove wrinkles, surface dirt, and bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;

As a paramedic, he’d seen the disastrous effects of other drugs and alcohol so, after years of fighting fires for the U.S Forest Service, he began to smoke marijuana to dull the pain from scoliosis and his torn-up knees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He became more interested in the plant’s potential benefits after seeing family members suffer from cancer and opioid abuse. Panks and his wife founded &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/homegrownorx"&gt;HomeGrown ORegonicX&lt;/a&gt;, a small medical cannabis farm that serves the deaf community in Oregon, and started smoking pot frequently every day to test different strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was shocked in 2013 when he was struck by vicious bouts of vomiting. He would start vomiting in the morning and continue the rest of the day non-stop, sometimes for days at a time. He couldn’t eat or keep down fluids. Only a hot shower would offer some relief. The condition would fade, then reemerge after two or three months, often at times of stress..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panks lost 50 pounds as his body seemed to be trying to purge something. His abdomen and back ached from constant dry heaves. His throat was burned by the stomach acids, and a dentist told him his teeth were ruined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a doctor gave him his diagnosis, he initially refused to believe it: cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, or CHS. While Panks doesn’t scream from it, other people affected sometimes cry out in pain, leading to its other name: scromiting, for the combination of screaming and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it goes 14 days, where my whole body starts to seize up,” Panks said. “I have to go to the ER and get fluids. It can be very, very brutal. You’re sliding down the stairs because you don’t have the strength to stand up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition is rare and the mechanism of its cause unexplained, prompting some cannabis advocates to refuse to believe it. But Panks is far from alone. A new study of hospital emergency departments nationwide by the University of Illinois Chicago found the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2841769?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=112425"&gt;number of diagnosed cases of CHS jumped sevenfold&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 to 2022.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase came at the same time as increased cannabis legalization and potency, and peaked at 33 cases per 100,000 ER visits during the COVID pandemic, when substance abuse increased sharply. The increase came primarily among young adults, 18 to 35, most of them men.				&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people with CHS are long-term users who smoke every day, often high potency weed or concentrates, research shows. Seventy-five percent of people diagnosed with CHS &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5330965/"&gt;consumed cannabis every day&lt;/a&gt;, a systematic review found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, cannabis is well-known for its ability improve appetite. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved synthetic THC for the treatment of nausea from conditions such as chemotherapy, though many patients prefer flowers from the plant itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like any drug, what can have mild effects in moderation may have toxic effects from over-consumption. It is known that cannabis acts on the endo-cannabinoid system, which helps regulate the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the UIC study, professor James Swartz, said he believes the increase in state legalization and higher potency were the main factors at work behind the increase. He hopes the study will encourage clinicians to consider CHS when treating patients.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“There is still some skepticism,” Swartz said. “Proponents of cannabis say this is being alarmist, it hardly occurs. No, this is real, and it’s common enough that it’s of concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People should consider the condition when considering how much to use and what’s safe, and take “a long hard look” at very high potency products, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swartz has some unlikely allies in the cannabis world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Blake, founder of The Emerald Cup, the Oscars of the cannabis world, said he ran into a wall with hyperemesis years ago and had to cut way back on his consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake is 68 and has been smoking since he was 14, with a few periods of abstinence. He has grown cannabis and used it to deal with three rounds of metastatic cancer, so he is an enthusiastic advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a little more than 10 years ago, he got very sick with cyclic vomiting. It only went away after he quit smoking for several months to eliminate the buildup of THC, the main component of pot that gets users high, and which accumulates in the body’s fatty tissues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, like drinkers who abstain from alcohol for “Dry January,” he starts every year by abstaining from cannabis for a month or two to clean out his system. When he stopped smoking, he would sweat profusely for five days to clean out his system. He stopped using concentrates, but still vapes once a day or so, and meditates daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decries the high THC dabs and concentrates that have transformed the use of marijuana for some, and advocates a more moderate approach to consumption, comparing weed to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We shouldn’t be drinking 151 rum shots every day,” he said. “We should do more beer and wine. It is a real issue we want to address so people can safely and effectively use cannabis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panks, who with his wife started Deafining Cannabis to develop sign language related to the plant, said that instead of focusing on high THC, users should look more into the effects of cannabis terpenes, the compounds that help give cannabis and other plants their distinctive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to stop looking at THC percentages and more at the terpenes, so you can understand how your body reacts,” he said. “I hope to be part of a study that can further define the mechanism of CHS and a documentary on the process so that we all can have a better understanding of the science behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHS research remains in its infancy, but may be enhanced by recent federal efforts to reclassify cannabis as a less dangerous drug. The World Health Organization only recently recognized CHS as a medical condition. Everyone affected by CHS wants more research to explain its causes, cures, the potential roles of neem oil and other pesticides, and why it affects some people and not others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, abstinence remains the only known cure for CHS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prominent &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/javierhasse/2020/03/13/alice-moon-chs/"&gt;cannabis advocate Alice Moon&lt;/a&gt; said she wants more research so maybe she can use cannabis again someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I promote a substance I cannot consume,” she said. “I’m adamant about spreading awareness, because I don’t want anybody to be as sick as I was.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;As New Year’s resolutions kick into high gear, many are looking to lose weight with drugs like Ozempic and other GLP-1 medications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bariatric surgeon Dr. Katelin Mirkin is among the medical doctors who warn that these medications are not without risk, and relying on them for a quick fix to weight loss could come with significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve noticed a lot of really impressive rebound weight gain after these drugs are stopped, particularly when they’re stopped abruptly,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Medications like Wegovy and Ozempic were originally designed to treat diabetes, but they’ve become increasingly popular among people using them for weight loss. As more and more Americans turn to GLP-1s, doctors are learning more about what happens when patients discontinue use of the drugs, including weight regain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people tolerate GLP-1 drugs well, but like any medication, they carry side effects. The most common include nausea, vomiting, constipation and slowed digestion. These effects occur because the drugs are working as intended by slowing gastrointestinal transit and suppressing appetite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are also concerns for more serious problems like pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, sarcopenia, which is a fancy word for muscle loss … and some rare thyroid cancer risks,” Mirkin said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, Mirkin said the medications are “pretty well tolerated” by most patients. But studies suggest that most people stop taking these drugs within a year and many quickly regain weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That negative feedback of that nausea that you felt from the medication isn’t there, and so you just kind of go back into old habits,” Mirkin said. “The drugs themselves slow how your GI system processes food, and so once that’s gone, you’re not going to feel a lot of those side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exactly why the weight returns after stopping GLP-1s is still being studied. Experts have said it’s likely a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I see patients that describe voracious hunger and appetite after stopping these medications. Or they try them for a while, have some success, but then can’t afford the financial burden of them or can’t tolerate the side effects,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctors agree that for many patients, especially those who are obese or have diabetes, GLP-1 drugs may need to be taken indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mirkin said the medications shouldn’t be considered a jump-start to lose weight or a quick fix that can be applied in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While patients are advised to pair the drugs with lifestyle changes like increased protein intake, strength training and mindful eating, some rely solely on the medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Some of these weight regains is even in people that have made these lifestyle changes,” Mirkin said. “But certainly your overall health is going to be better if you can kind of commit to healthier habits in general.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Three children have died from the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/flu-season-spike-new-cdc-data/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in Massachusetts so far this season, the Department of Public Health said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deaths occurred in recent weeks as peak flu season gets underway. The department said it could not provide information about the patients' ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These viruses are serious, dangerous, and life-threatening. We are seeing children who are seriously ill, families grieving devastating losses, and hospitals under capacity strain," Public Health Commissioner Dr. Robbie Goldstein said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Would not be surprising to see more"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 10 pediatric flu deaths in the 2024-2025 season, the department said - a record-high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's early in the season yet and it would not be surprising to see more, sadly," said Dr. Larry Madoff, the medical director of the department's bureau of infectious disease and laboratory sciences. "It's shaping up to be a severe early flu season."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Madoff said children under the age of 2 are most at risk of dying from the flu, but doctors are also seeing severe cases in children as old as 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Kids do get quite ill with the flu, they also spread it to their classmates and to their parents and family at home," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flu activity is now "very high" in the state for the first time this season. Nine percent of all hospitalizations in the state are associated with the flu, compared to 5% the previous week.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been 29 adult deaths from the flu this season. The state is also investigating two possible COVID-associated deaths and one RSV-associated death in patients under 18 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Flu vaccination push&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials are stressing that it's not too late to get a flu or COVID vaccine. Flu and COVID vaccination rates in Massachusetts have been &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flu-covid-vaccination-rate-massachusetts/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;"really lagging"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this year," Dr. Madoff said, with just 1 out of every 9 residents vaccinated against COVID and 1 in 3 vaccinated against flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These deaths underscore the need for kids to be vaccinated," Dr. Madoff said. "Everyone should get a flu vaccine, everyone over the age of 6 months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials in the city of Boston warned in late December that it was seeing a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/flu-season-massachusetts-vaccine/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;114% increase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in flu cases. The biggest jump in cases was reported among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boston is holding free flu and COVID vaccine clinics for children 6 months and older in January. &lt;a href="https://www.boston.gov/government/cabinets/boston-public-health-commission/free-vaccine-clinics-boston" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-roots-of-dementia-trace-back-all-the-way-to-childhood-experts-find"&gt;The Roots of Dementia Trace Back All The Way to Childhood, Experts Find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one that asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-6-key-depression-symptoms-that-predict-dementia-risk"&gt;Scientists Identify 6 Key Depression Symptoms That Predict Dementia Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="187505" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3y9cbGY/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have also been &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.803220/full"&gt;case reports&lt;/a&gt; showing improvements in memory and thinking skills after treating nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that treating nightmares might help to slow cognitive decline and to prevent dementia from developing in some people. This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-itself-could-be-a-crucial-element-in-preventing-dementia-study-finds"&gt;Time Itself Could Be a Crucial Element in Preventing Dementia, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

It's more than I can recall in at least the last several years," said Dr. Robert Citronberg, executive medical director of infectious disease and prevention at Advocate Health Care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Flu activity in the state has climbed to "Very High," which is the most severe of five categories of respiratory illness activity, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;COVID-19 rates have climbed to "moderate" levels in Illinois, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Illinois officials did not release where in the state the child died. It was not immediately known if the child was vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's really increased sharply in the last few weeks to the point where we're seeing tons and tons of patients in our clinics and in our emergency departments," Citronberg said. "We're seeing severe illness, actually. So we are seeing patients in our intensive care units. And believe it or not, we've actually seen some patients die from influenza."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Across the country, there have been nine pediatric deaths due to influenza this season, IDPH said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;IDPH said, during the 2024-2025 season, Illinois reported 12 pediatric deaths from influenza, six from RSV and three from COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In Cook County, the percentage of emergency room visits due to influenza has surpassed the peak of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;And the number of flu-related intensive care unit admissions is double what it was last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is usually the normal pattern of when we get flu, but it is obviously concerning this year just because of the high numbers that we're getting this time of year," said Dr. Trevor Lewis, Cook County Health assistant chair of Emergency Medicine. "It probably started the middle part of December. And with the holidays, lots of people gathering with family and friends, and kids going back to school, it's really spiked these last two weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/flu-like-illness-activity-now-highest-rate-record-linked-new-subclade-variant-cdc-data-shows/18356557/"&gt;Flu activity&lt;/a&gt; is continuing to climb across the U.S. as hospitalizations rise, according to newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Making Broccoli-Cheddar Butter Beans helps follow a more Mediterranean-style diet.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans have protein and fiber and are an inexpensive pantry staple. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dish can be adapted to fit certain diets, and it’s made with ingredients you probably have on hand.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans are on regular rotation in our house, and that’s not just because I’m a dietitian (though that might also have something to do with it). If you’re like me and rising grocery prices are giving you sticker shock at the checkout, beans have your back. Compared to other proteins, beans remain a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7889149/cheap-healthy-foods-to-buy-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;budget-friendly staple&lt;/a&gt; that’s a real nutrition powerhouse too—so you’re getting your money’s worth. Not to mention, if one of your goals is to follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;plant-based proteins&lt;/a&gt; like beans just happen to be a foundational food. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But I know that not everyone loves beans as much as I do. They have a reputation for being boring and bland, but that doesn’t have to be the case. They just need plenty of seasoning or a flavorful sauce to help them shine, like most proteins do. That’s one of the many reasons why I love these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/broccoli-cheddar-butter-beans-11785020" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;broccoli-Cheddar butter beans&lt;/a&gt;. Butter beans don’t have much flavor on their own, but their creamy and tender texture pairs perfectly with the flavors of a classic comfort food like broccoli-Cheddar soup. It’s guaranteed to convert even the biggest bean skeptic.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Embodies the Mediterranean Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re looking to apply some of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;principles of the Mediterranean-style diet&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a smart move to put this butter bean skillet on the dinner menu. This research-backed healthful eating pattern puts a heavy emphasis on eating a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;variety of plants&lt;/a&gt;— including vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, seeds and whole grains—and this butter bean skillet fits right in. Beans offer a winning combo of both protein and fiber to help fill you up, while broccoli adds color and a host of antioxidants to this dish. When you’re building your meals around such &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290550/10-everyday-superfoods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;nutrient-dense foods&lt;/a&gt;, it’s no wonder that the Mediterranean-style diet is associated with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-diabetes-risk-study-8736965" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;reduced diabetes risk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mediterranean-diet-foods-to-help-you-live-longer-11849104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Helps Me Eat More Beans &amp;amp; Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to mention, most of us could use more beans in our diet. Research shows that eating more beans is linked with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-diet-multimorbidity-study-11796092" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower risk of chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; like heart disease and diabetes, as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-you-should-do-everyday-for-better-gut-health-11782347" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;better gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, there are so many positive health benefits to beans that the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that everyone should be eating 1½ cups of beans per week—but most Americans fall short.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So why not up your bean intake (and reap all the benefits) while indulging in classic comfort food flavors? You’ll also score a bunch of fiber (thanks to the butter beans)—just one serving of this recipe provides 12 grams of fiber, more than 40% of your daily fiber intake!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another reason that this broccoli-Cheddar butter beans recipe has become a staple in our dinner rotation is that it can be whipped up in just 30 minutes. As I’m sure many parents to young kids know, there’s nothing like the post-school rush to get something on the table. That’s why I always keep my pantry stocked with a couple of varieties of canned beans, since they’re such a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290653/30-minute-dinner-solutions-the-ingredient-staples-you-should-always-have-on-hand/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;time-saving staple&lt;/a&gt;. And speaking of saving time, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitian-favorite-30-minute-one-pot-recipes-8386779" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;one-pot meals&lt;/a&gt; are always on my radar because the less time I have to spend doing dishes after dinner, the better. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Flexible &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the recipe is delicious as written, I don’t always have all the ingredients on hand when the craving strikes. Luckily, this recipe can be easily adapted. The fresh broccoli can be switched out for frozen in a pinch—no need to even thaw it, just toss it in frozen. Plus, if you can’t find butter beans, you can swap them for white beans, lima beans or even chickpeas. For those with vegan or dairy-free eaters in the family, you can adjust the recipe to accommodate them too. Simply use &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290343/how-to-start-eating-dairy-free/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dairy-free versions&lt;/a&gt; of butter and Cheddar cheese and swap the half-and-half for coconut milk. (That’s one of my go-to plant-based swaps for creamy dishes!)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I happily eat this up with a slice of sourdough or two, while my husband likes pairing it with a simple salad to round out the meal.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO — Flu-related hospital visits are rising to their highest levels in over three years across Chicago as health officials say there’s still time to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;The positivity rate of people testing for influenza is just over 24 percent, with emergency room visits spiking to “very high” levels, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/infectious/respiratory-illness/respiratory-illness-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;according to the latest data&lt;/a&gt; Saturday from the Chicago Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those levels are the highest since 2022. All age groups have seen increases, but most notably among children 17 years and younger, according to the health department.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rise is driven by a new variant of the flu, known as “subclade K,” that’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/flu-virus-new-variant-what-to-know/3869885/?amp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;led to outbreaks globally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Across the United States, there have been at least 81,000 hospitalizations and 3,100 deaths from the flu this season, including eight deaths of children, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-51.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The respiratory season is here,” the city’s health department said in a statement. “Vaccines are the best way to protect yourself and others from severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Free vaccinations are available at many pharmacies and the city’s standing Immunization Clinics, with locations and hours &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/clinical_health/immunization_clinics.html#clinics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eileen Manojlovic, a family nurse practitioner with Rush University System for Health, said basic hygiene is one of the best ways to stop the flu.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Keep yourself healthy, make sure to take all your medication, drink plenty of fluids, get your vaccines, stay home until you don’t have a fever, cover coughs and wash hands,” Manojlovic said. “We usually see more cases after the holidays, after everyone is around a lot of people, not eating properly.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High stress levels and a lack of sleep can also raise your chances of catching the flu, Manojlovic said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rush offers vaccinations at its urgent care clinics, 1625 N. Harlem Ave. and 539 N. Dearborn St.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not too late to get them,” Manojlovic said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, activity is currently “moderate” and COVID activity “remains low,” according to the city health department.&lt;/p&gt;

"Vitamin B12 plays a key role in converting the food that you eat into energy and is also required for nerve function and red blood cell production," Rachael Ajmera, MS, RD, dietitian, writer, and founder of &lt;a href="https://nutrimental.co/author/rachaellink1gmail-com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nutrimental&lt;/a&gt;, told &lt;em&gt;Health.&lt;/em&gt; While B12 is best known for being found in animal foods and fortified products, beverages can be a simple and convenient way to increase your intake.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Though plant-based milks don’t naturally contain vitamin B12, many are fortified to provide an amount comparable to cow’s milk," explained Ajmera.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use: &lt;/strong&gt;Use fortified plant milks in coffee, tea, cereal, oatmeal, and smoothies. Not all plant milks are fortified, so be sure to choose products that contain added B12 if you’re looking to increase your intake. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smoothies are an excellent way to boost your intake of essential nutrients, like protein, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/food/healthy-fats" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, vitamins, and minerals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Yogurt contains naturally occurring B12, and blending it into smoothies makes it easy to consume daily," noted Ajmera. "Smoothies can be a smart way to squeeze extra vitamin B12 into your diet, especially for busy adults, teens, and picky eaters who have a hard time meeting their needs."

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for: &lt;/strong&gt;People who need an easy-to-consume source of B12, such as older adults and those with low appetite, and those looking for a nutritious, easy-to-make snack. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use: &lt;/strong&gt;Blend yogurt with &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/frozen-fruit-vs-fresh-fruit-8749485" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;frozen or fresh berries&lt;/a&gt;, nut butter, protein powder, and milk of your choice for a balanced smoothie.  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meal replacement drinks and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/best-vegan-protein-powder" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein powders&lt;/a&gt; often contain added vitamins and minerals, including B12. A single serving of fortified protein powder can cover over 100% of your daily B12 needs, depending on the brand.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides protein, these drinks provide an easy source of calories and other essential nutrients in a convenient, easy-to-prepare beverage.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike traditional capsules and tablets, vitamin powders offer a convenient, drinkable source of vitamins, such as vitamin B12. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ajmera recommends vitamin powders for those who have difficulty swallowing pills. "Vitamin powders typically contain highly absorbable forms of vitamin B12 that dissolve in water, making them gentle on digestion and easy to take consistently," she said. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Keep in mind that vitamin powders are considered a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/supplements-7775481" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dietary supplement&lt;/a&gt; and often contain well over 1,000% of your daily needs. Because of this, they should be consumed only as recommended on the label.

"A 1-cup serving can provide nearly one-third of your daily needs for vitamin B12," said Ajmera.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kefir is also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/dairy-with-more-probiotics-than-yogurt-11760661" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packed with probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which are beneficial bacteria that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/foods-for-gut-health-11689997" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; and immune function. "This makes kefir a solid choice for anyone looking to support digestive health while also upping their intake of vitamin B12," said Ajmera.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with B12, kefir also delivers calcium, vitamin A, and protein, making it an all-around nutritious drink option.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When selecting drinks to boost your B12 intake, it’s important to consider the following factors:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at B12 content:&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re trying to boost your B12 levels through beverages, choose products that contain at least 25% of the DV per serving. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair B12-rich drinks with B12-rich foods:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinks are one way to increase your B12 intake, but it’s also important to choose meals and snacks that contain B12.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid drinks high in added sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Choose B12-rich drinks that are free from added sugar, as consuming &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/surprising-foods-with-sugar-11784593" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;too much added sugar&lt;/a&gt; can harm health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinks are not a replacement for supplementation:&lt;/strong&gt; If your B12 levels are low, drinks alone may not be enough to raise them. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to increase your intake and whether a supplement may be needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; B12 from supplements and fortified foods is considered safe and has no established upper limit, as excess amounts are generally excreted in your urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, extremely high intakes are not typically necessary, as your body can only absorb small amounts of B12 at a time.

&lt;p id="7b5a15c4-0079-4deb-bec8-465cb32beb70"&gt;A 47-year-long Swedish study set out to provide new insights into when our bodies start to age by looking at how fitness, strength, and muscle endurance change during adulthood. The results? Our bodies begin to deteriorate as early as age 35, but there’s good news — you can slow your performance loss down by moving more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41243424/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41243424/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which was conducted at the Karolinska Institutet and published as part of the &lt;em&gt;Swedish Physical Activity and Fitness study&lt;/em&gt; (SPAF), followed several hundred randomly selected men and women, all of whom were born in 1958. Researchers assessed the participants’ maximal aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, muscle power, and physical performance using various athletic tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="7b5a15c4-0079-4deb-bec8-465cb32beb70-2"&gt;The scientists found that the general population showed similar changes in physical capacity to those previously demonstrated in elite athletes — peak physical performance is reached before age 35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;The good news is that researchers also found encouraging evidence that adults who became physically active improved their performance by 5-10%, demonstrating that physical activity can slow down the performance loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="93c6453f-b5ca-45b0-a736-522e5739a098"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="c11d2bd4-2f72-49d8-89da-07f8df9e9223"&gt;Maria Westerståhl, lecturer at the Department of Laboratory Medicine and lead author of the study, said, “It is never too late to start moving. Our study shows that physical activity can slow the decline in performance, even if it cannot completely stop it. Now we will look for the mechanisms behind why everyone reaches their peak performance at age 35 and why physical activity can slow performance loss but not completely halt it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study continues, and this year the participants will turn 68 and be examined again. The researchers hope to link the changes in physical capacity to lifestyle, health, and biological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you waiting for?

In November, the state’s public health commissioner, Robbie Goldstein, said officials expected &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-takes-additional-action-to-make-it-easier-to-get-flu-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/news/healey-driscoll-administration-takes-additional-action-to-make-it-easier-to-get-flu-vaccines"&gt;“rising flu activity and the potential for a significant surge”&lt;/a&gt; this season. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Getting vaccinated will reduce the burden of this easily transmitted and potentially dangerous respiratory disease across the state,” Goldstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Vaccination rates for the flu in Massachusetts are down, &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/immunizations-for-respiratory-diseases"&gt;according to DPH data&lt;/a&gt;. About 34 percent of Massachusetts residents have been vaccinated this season, down from about 36 percent last year at this time. That continues a decline since the 2020-21 season, when 43.5 percent of residents were vaccinated at this point, according to the data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/hcp/clinicians-evaluating-patients/interim-guidance-treatment-humans.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/hcp/clinicians-evaluating-patients/interim-guidance-treatment-humans.html"&gt;early antiviral treatment&lt;/a&gt; for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Flu is particularly dangerous for people 65 and older, pregnant women, young children and people of any age who have chronic health problems, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease and weak immune systems, health officials say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nationwide, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;influenza activity has been climbing&lt;/a&gt; for several weeks, according to the CDC, and state health officials classify flu activity in Massachusetts as &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/influenza-reporting"&gt;“very high”&lt;/a&gt; for this time of year. The most common influenza strain in the state is “Seasonal type A,” according to DPH. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last week, the CDC reported high or very high levels of illness in more than half the states.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There have been nine reported influenza-related pediatric deaths this year nationally, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the fact that episodes of his podcast can run longer than &lt;em&gt;Avatar 3&lt;/em&gt;, Huberman’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; has more than 7 million subscribers. In 2023, a TikTok user named Sierra Campbell chronicled her husband’s health and longevity hacks, coining the term “&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/opinion/huberman-husband.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/opinion/huberman-husband.html"}' href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/opinion/huberman-husband.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Huberman Husband&lt;/a&gt;.” Though you may be more familiar with another &lt;em&gt;Huberman Lab&lt;/em&gt; nickname: Goop for bros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Huberman, 50, doesn’t shy away from the comparison (more on that soon). In fact, he’s going all-in, launching a collaboration with Gwyneth Paltrow’s restaurant concept &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.goopkitchen.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.goopkitchen.com/"}' href="https://www.goopkitchen.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Goop Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, which I once had delivered as a joke but now order regularly. (The Japanese sweet potato soup is that good.) Huberman’s signature meal—available today at Goop’s 13 California locations—is an organic turkey chili made with kidney beans and a blend of five chiles; for $16.95, you can build your own bowl, adding sweet potato, pickled cabbage, lime crema, pickled jalapenos and fresh cilantro. Like everything at Goop Kitchen, the dish has no processed sugar, seed oils, or gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hope of starting the year right, we hopped on a Zoom with Huberman to talk about how he’s staying healthy in 2026—minding his &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-cortisol-levels"&gt;cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;, integrating fermented foods in his diet, and minding his micronutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;GQ:&lt;/em&gt; How did your collaboration with Goop come to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Huberman: When I use DoorDash, I put in “organic grass-fed” and I just see what gets picked up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many restaurants come up, one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, in Los Angeles or in Austin—more. Goop Kitchen popped up. I was like, “All right, I’ll try this Bento box-looking thing.” Then I found myself wanting to drink the sauce, which never happens. This carrot ginger dressing? I was like, I’d buy a bottle of this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s a good sign if you want to drink the condiments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept blabbing about it to people. Somehow that got back to Gwyneth. Then she reached out saying, “It would be fun to do something.” She must have done her homework. I think some people assume that I’m the “optimization guy” or the “massive amounts of protein intake” guy. No, I’m 50 years old. I’ve been into fitness since I was 16. Sure, I like eating protein, lifting weights. But being healthy—being able to move, sleeping well—it’s the full picture. And it’s got to be easily attained. The turkey chili doesn’t taste like turkey. It tastes a bit more like beef to me. It has a lot of protein but some starch. I’m not one of these anti-carbohydrate people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your podcast has been called “Goop for bros.” How do you feel about that comparison?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwyneth was first in this general space of thinking about one’s health. And also bringing about a real life aspect to it, right? Sometimes you can cook. Sometimes you need food prepared for you. She’s doing all the vetting of sourcing. I’m a fan. It’s interesting, I think the press tends to pick up on the most extremes on the distribution of any one kind of personal brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly. For us that would be, ‘it’s all about &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-supplements"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/best-cold-plunges"&gt;cold plunges&lt;/a&gt;.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a good segue. How &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; you staying healthy in 2026? What habits are you still focused on, and what have you lost interest in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brace yourself for this. Getting your physical health right—which puts your mental health in the best possible place—is all about intentionally &lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt; cortisol in the morning and intentionally &lt;em&gt;low&lt;/em&gt; cortisol at night. Everyone goes, “Oh my God, cortisol is a stress hormone. It’s going to give me visceral fat, moon face.” No, you wake up in the morning because of a rise in cortisol. You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; a big, massive spike of cortisol in the morning. If you don’t spike your morning cortisol, your cortisol spikes in the afternoon or evening and then everything goes awry, OK? You want your morning cortisol at least 30x higher than your nighttime cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I get that hit of high cortisol in the morning then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to spike your morning cortisol is to &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-key-to-better-sleep-is-going-outside-in-the-morning"&gt;get bright light—ideally from sunlight—in your eyes in the first hour after waking&lt;/a&gt;. If you can’t do that, maybe invest in a 10,000 Lux artificial light. If you can’t do that, just flip on as many artificial lights as you can. I’ve made a mistake in the past—a tactical mistake, a strategic mistake—by calling it &lt;em&gt;sunlight.&lt;/em&gt; People say, “it’s overcast.” What we should say is, “&lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-key-to-better-sleep-is-going-outside-in-the-morning#:~:text=Early%20light%20tells%20your%20brain,effects%20beyond%20the%20circadian%20system."&gt;Get daylight in your eyes&lt;/a&gt;.” Dim mornings and bright nights is the worst way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else should I be doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can work out first thing in the morning, great. If you don’t have time to exercise first thing in the morning, you need bodily movement. Even some knee bends, some arm swings, some jumping jacks. Movement generates cortisol and adrenaline. Then, at night, you want to do everything the opposite way. If you want to wear BluBlockers, you can. But dim the lights down, avoid caffeine. If you’re going to exercise, don’t make it terribly intense. You wouldn’t want to cold plunge at night. Notice I didn’t even say “cold plunge” for morning. We could talk about cold plunges in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*We never came back to this. But when later asked about cold plunges by e-mail, Huberman’s rep clarified his current stance: “Andrew is still a fan of cold plunges. They are a fantastic way to increase mood, focus, and alertness. But they’re not the only ways. There are easier, more cost-effective ways to increase cortisol in the morning. Getting outside, getting some movement in. Some people mistake the fact that Andrew likes cold plunges for a belief that they are a cornerstone of what he advocates for or that he thinks they’re essential to a healthy routine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should we be thinking about our diet in 2026?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way I eat is very simple. And I think this is the way that most people—on or off GLPs—should eat. And I’m not on GLPs. If you’re going to eat what people would call a “full meal,” ideally you include some high-quality protein. Generally, animal-based proteins or a combination of plant proteins. High quality protein has a high protein-to-calorie ratio. I don’t doubt that you can get a lot of protein from peanut butter. But you’re going to make yourself sick and overweight eating enough peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you been looking in my kitchen cabinet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves peanut butter. But it’s not a protein. It’s a lipid, it’s a fat. One thing that we’re going to hear a lot more about this year is micronutrients. It’s not that difficult, certainly not in the United States, to get enough &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/what-are-macros"&gt;&lt;em&gt;macronutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—calories, that is, including protein—for low cost. You can go eat two burger patties from a fast food joint and get your protein ratio for that meal. The point is that it’s hard—even with eating fruits and vegetables—to get enough &lt;em&gt;micronutrients.&lt;/em&gt; So &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/7-types-of-magnesium-and-what-they-can-do-for-you"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, all the positive polyphenols that we know are so valuable. I think the new way of eating is going to be people thinking about not just macronutrient content but what tastes great and has high &lt;em&gt;micronutrient&lt;/em&gt; content. That’s why eating a small piece of fish—you’re going to get your protein at a good protein quality-to-calorie ratio, you’re getting some healthy lipids, and it’s got a bunch of other things in there that are healthy, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I have to worry about fibermaxxing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People should probably get most of their fiber from vegetables. Some fruit is fine. Berries, oranges, apples, low-sugar fruits. I will tell you, instead of &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/high-fiber-diet-3"&gt;fibermaxxing&lt;/a&gt;, the big thing—it’s been known for a while, but it’s really going to hit a square-on in 2026—is low-sugar &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-best-fermented-foods-for-gut-health-according-to-an-expert"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt;. These are the ways that you support the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you talking about pickles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pickles, as long as they have to be refrigerated, with low-sugar. A sauerkraut, kimchi, natto. The &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/05/research-matters-justin-and-erica-sonnenberg"&gt;study done at Stanford&lt;/a&gt;—in my colleague, Justin Sonnenburg’s lab—showed that increasing the consumption of low-sugar fermented foods dramatically reduced the inflammatome and supported the gut-brain access and gut microbiome. This [study] was done in humans. Increasing fiber, however, had a varied effect. Some people’s levels of inflammation went up, other people went down. You have to find which fibrous foods work for you, right? By the way, you can make your own sauerkraut if you really are motivated. Because it can be expensive. Kombucha can be expensive for people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Laughing]&lt;/em&gt; You know what’s also expensive for people? Goop Kitchen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I’ll just restate, when you push it through the filter of ‘how can you get high-quality, low-calorie but high macronutrient content?’ The price is reasonable for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s just go with the data. And then I’ll place a small revision, OK? Zero is still better than any. Especially for women, because of the breast cancer risk and other hormone-related cancer risk. This was just &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2025/08/alcohol-consumption-and-your-health--what-the-science-says.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; by my colleague, Keith Humphreys, at Stanford. Anytime you hear “cardiac benefit from a little bit of wine,” guess what? It’s greatly offset by the cancer risk. You can’t take the benefit in isolation. However, if you are an adult who is a non-alcoholic, you can enjoy probably two drinks per week without any concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now we’re talking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a teetotaler. I totally acknowledge the &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/the-end-of-drinking-isnt-necessarily-a-good-thing"&gt;social-stress reduction benefits of the occasional glass of wine or a cocktail&lt;/a&gt;. The revision would be, it’s absolutely clear that zero [alcohol] is better than any. But guess what? Living life is better than trying to turn yourself into some sort of mutant to exist a little bit longer. I’ve always been about enjoying life. I wish I had never said the word “optimize.” Because optimization includes mental health, which includes pleasures in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you ever have RFK Jr. on your show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know, I don’t know that that conversation makes sense for our show. It’s not an impossibility. I’d probably bring &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-organization/martin-makary"&gt;Marty [Makary]&lt;/a&gt; on as well from the FDA. There are a few topics I’m particularly interested in. For instance, potential legalization of psychedelics for the treatment of mental health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know someone who had a good experience at Cedars-Sinai with a &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ketaminectr.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ketaminectr.com/"}' href="https://www.ketaminectr.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ketamine treatment&lt;/a&gt; for depression.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fantastic. Ketamine, MDMA for PTSD, the depression stuff, ibogaine for severe chemical use disorder—I’m very interested in those. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; conversation could happen. I think we should just acknowledge the 600-pound gorilla in the room, right? Vaccines. I asked [NIH director] &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/nih-director"&gt;Jay Bhattacharya&lt;/a&gt; on my podcast directly, “Do you think vaccines have saved lives?” He says, “Yes.” I asked, “Do you think childhood vaccines have saved lives?” “Yes.” You want &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; big question? The big question that needs resolving is, “Does the inflammation associated with any vaccine become a cumulative risk on a backdrop of either genetic susceptibility or number of vaccines as spaced out in time?” Not “is this vaccine dangerous” or “is that vaccine dangerous.” Because I think the data on those tend to be fairly clear. Look, I’ll sit down with anyone. It’s not an impossibility. But I prefer on my podcast to have conversations about biology with biologists and clinical issues with clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming back to your Goop meal, is there a sleeper hit in it? A side dish? A sauce?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turkey chili is so good. Their roasted potatoes are out of this world.

This work provides a streamlined, evidence-based way to describe language backgrounds for research, education, and clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Measurement Tool:&lt;/strong&gt; Calculator integrates age of language acquisition and self-rated skills across modalities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate Scoring:&lt;/strong&gt; Validated against complex language-background methods with nearly identical results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dominance Profile:&lt;/strong&gt; Computes which language is strongest based on comparative proficiency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wide Language Support:&lt;/strong&gt; Works across ~50 languages, including sign language and custom entries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NYU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than half of the world’s population speaks more than one language—but there is no consistent method for defining “bilingual” or “multilingual.” This makes it difficult to accurately assess proficiency across multiple languages and to describe language backgrounds accurately. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of New York University researchers has now created a calculator that scores multilingualism, allowing users to see how multilingual they actually are and which language is their dominant one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, which uses innovative formulas to build the calculator, is reported in the journal &lt;em&gt;Bilingualism: Language and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Multilingualism is a very broad label,” explains Esti Blanco-Elorrieta, an assistant professor of psychology and neural science at NYU and the paper’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These new formulas provide a clear, evidence-based way to understand your language strengths and how multilingual you truly are, bringing scientific clarity to an everyday part of life for millions of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculator works in nearly 50 languages, including American Sign Language, and allows users to fill in an unlisted language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blanco-Elorrieta and Xuanyi Jessica Chen, an NYU doctoral student and the paper’s lead author, developed the formulas—embedded in a multilingual calculator that users can deploy to measure their multilingualism and language dominance—that are drawn from two primary variables:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Age of language acquisition for listening, reading, speaking, and writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Self-rated language proficiency for listening, reading, speaking, and writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calculator then yields a multilingualism score, which indicates how multilingual a person is on a scale from monolingual to perfect polyglot. The language-dominance is separately tabulated by calculating the difference in ability between languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors—both multilingual speakers—note that past research has shown that self-rated language proficiency is, in fact, an accurate and efficient measure of actual language proficiency. The researchers also implemented other statistical controls to minimize self-rating bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add that, similarly, age of language acquisition has been shown to be a predictor of abilities: the earlier one learns a language, the more likely it is they will be able to master native-like proficiency in that language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers validated their measure by testing it in two distinct populations: healthy young bilinguals and older bilinguals with language impairments. They compared their results to those obtained from existing methods that rely on acquiring much more extensive language background information. Across both groups, the formulas produced language-dominance results that were nearly identical to those generated by more complicated measures, showing that the new approach is both simple and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rather than just labeling someone as ‘bilingual’ or ‘monolingual,’ this tool quantifies how multilingual one is,” notes Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This calculator offers a transparent, quantitative tool that researchers, clinicians, and educators can adopt to better characterize multilingual populations, ultimately improving research quality and real-world applications—from language education to clinical assessment,” concludes Blanco-Elorrieta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The research was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R00DC019973) and the National Science Foundation (2446452).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1767636285979"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Why is defining “bilingual” or “multilingual” difficult?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Individuals differ in how and when they learn each language, so broad labels don’t capture meaningful variation in proficiency or dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1767636287554"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What does the new calculator measure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It quantifies multilingualism using age of acquisition and self-rated abilities in listening, speaking, reading, and writing for each language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1767636287140"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How accurate is this approach?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Validation tests show that the calculator produces dominance profiles comparable to traditional, more time-consuming assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurotech and multilingualism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97fdf6faf2e4b9f3f2e1fee3e3d7f9eee2b9f2f3e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;James Devitt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nyu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;James Devitt – NYU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1366728925100849" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A theoretically driven and empiric&lt;/a&gt;ally grounded calculation for language dominance and degree of multilingualism” by Esti Blanco-Elorrieta et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bilingualism Language and Cognition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A theoretically driven and empirically grounded calculation for language dominance and degree of multilingualism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bilingualism research has long been challenged by a lack of a unified approach to quantifying language dominance and degree of multilingualism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While numerous questionnaires (e.g., LHQ, BLP, LEAP‑Q, and LUQ) provide valuable data on language background variables, they lack a standardized formula to compute key measures from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We introduce two formulas that synthesize critical linguistic variables to efficiently calculate language dominance and a multilingualism score that ranges from perfect monolingualism to native-like proficiency in multiple languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validation across two large datasets shows our dominance measure closely aligns with more complex PCA methods while being simpler and more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;

Scores on cognitive brain tests were mapped against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-happiness-report-shows-some-benefits-have-come-out-of-the-pandemic"&gt;helping behavior&lt;/a&gt; – whether volunteering with an organization or simply giving friends, relatives, and neighbors a hand as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experiment-reveals-how-pressure-to-tip-can-unexpectedly-backfire"&gt;Experiment Reveals How Pressure to Tip Can Unexpectedly Backfire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What stood out to me was that the cognitive benefits of helping others weren't just short-term boosts but cumulative over time with sustained engagement, and these benefits were evident for both formal volunteering and informal helping," &lt;a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/news/research/helping-others-shown-slow-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Sae Hwang Han, a social scientist at UT Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And in addition to that, moderate engagement of just two to four hours was consistently linked to robust benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_187539" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187539" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/CognitiveDecline.jpg" alt="Cognitive decline" class="wp-image-187539 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/CognitiveDecline.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/CognitiveDecline-600x321.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-187539" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Modeling showed that formal volunteering was associated with a slowing of cognitive decline when people started volunteering about 2–4 hours each week, totaling more than 100 hours per year.

Prior studies have shown that loneliness can be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/being-lonely-can-literally-give-you-nightmares-study-finds"&gt;bad for our brains&lt;/a&gt; and that physical activity can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/review-of-thousands-of-studies-confirms-best-way-to-keep-memory-sharp"&gt;keep the mind sharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the researchers examined both informal helping and structured volunteering, and they tracked changes over time. The slowing in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-surprising-age-at-which-your-brain-reaches-its-peak"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; appears cumulative; being a helpful person continues to pay off year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Informal helping is sometimes assumed to offer fewer health benefits due to its lack of social recognition," &lt;a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/news/research/helping-others-shown-slow-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Han.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a pleasant surprise to find that it provides cognitive benefits comparable to formal volunteering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around two to four hours per week spent helping others seems to be the sweet spot for optimizing its cognitive benefits. It's possible that beyond that point, the mental and physical efforts of being a helper &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/switching-off-for-a-moment-lets-your-brain-do-something-wonderful"&gt;start to take their toll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cases of dementia &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/us-dementia-cases-to-double-by-2060-according-to-new-study"&gt;on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, scientists are on the lookout for &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/infographics-do/dementia-risk"&gt;modifiable risk factors&lt;/a&gt; – those that we can do something about, like changing our diet or exercise routine. Lending a hand to others could help maintain social connections in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that when helping behaviors stopped, this was associated with lower cognitive scores and faster &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. There's a strong case here for ensuring that older adults have opportunities to give back to others and their community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many older adults in suboptimal health often continue to make valuable contributions to those around them, and they also may be the ones to especially benefit from being provided with opportunities to help," &lt;a href="https://cns.utexas.edu/news/research/helping-others-shown-slow-cognitive-decline"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Han.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2025.118465"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. flu infections surged over the holidays, and health officials are calling it a severe season that is likely to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New government &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; posted Monday — for flu activity through the week of Christmas — showed that by some measures this season is already surpassing the flu epidemic of last winter, one of the harshest in recent history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 infections also have been rising, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;other federal data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; show, though they remain less common than flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-five states were reporting high or very high flu activity during the week of Christmas, up from 30 states &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-subclade-k-cdc-vaccine-ca9bd270ca70602775168b0b651e3b2a"&gt;the week before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of flu that’s been spreading may be driving the higher numbers, public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type of flu virus, called A H3N2, historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. So far this season, that’s the type most frequently reported. Even more concerning, more than 90% of the H3N2 infections analyzed were a new version — known as the subclade K variant — that differs from the strain in this year’s flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Flu seasons often don’t peak until January or February, so it’s too early to know how big a problem that mismatch will be.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last flu season was bad, with the overall flu hospitalization rate the highest since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/flu-deaths-children-cdc-e79b1e4169d629ad4bc1095d95d82110"&gt;Child flu deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; reached 288, the worst recorded for regular U.S. flu season.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Nine pediatric flu deaths have been reported so far this season. For children, the percentage of emergency department visits due to flu has already surpassed the highest mark seen during the 2024-2025 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The percentage of doctor’s office and medical clinic visits that were due to flu-like illness also was higher late last month than at any point during the previous flu season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates at least 11 million illnesses, 120,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths from flu have already occurred this season.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The agency recommends that everyone 6 months and older who has not yet been vaccinated this season get an annual influenza vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;p&gt;An injection that blocks the activity of a protein involved in aging reverses naturally occurring cartilage loss in the knee joints of old mice, a Stanford Medicine-led &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx6649" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment also prevented the development of arthritis after knee injuries such as ACL tears often experienced by athletes or recreational exercisers. An oral version of the treatment is already in clinical trials with the goal of treating age-related muscle weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples of human tissue from knee replacement surgeries in the joint also responded to the treatment by making new, functional cartilage, a result which suggests that in the future, knee and hip replacement may be totally unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment directly targets the cause of osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that affects one of every five adults in the United States and is estimated to cost about $65 billion in direct health care costs each year. Prevention or a replacement is the only strategy society-wide, as no drug can slow down or reverse the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protein blocked by the injection, 15-PGDH, is a master regulator of aging, and is in fact termed a “gerozyme” due to its increase in prevalence as the body ages. Gerozymes also drive the loss of tissue function. They are a major force behind age-related loss of muscle strength in mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the function of 15-PGDH with a small molecule results in an increase in old animals’ muscle mass and endurance. Conversely, expressing 15-PGDH in young mice causes their muscles to shrink and weaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bone, nerve, and blood cells, regeneration is due to increases in the proliferation and specialization of tissue-specific stem cells. However, cartilage-generating chondrocytes change their patterns of gene expression to assume a more youthful state without the involvement of stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a new way of regenerating adult tissue, and it has significant clinical promise for treating arthritis due to aging or injury,” &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/11/joint-cartilage-aging.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Helen Blau, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology. “We were looking for stem cells, but they are clearly not involved. It’s very exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Millions of people suffer from joint pain and swelling as they age,” said Blau’s colleague and co-senior author, Nidhi Bhutani, a PhD and associate professor of orthopedic surgery. “It is a huge unmet medical need. Until now, there has been no drug that directly treats the cause of cartilage loss. But this gerozyme inhibitor causes a dramatic regeneration of cartilage beyond that reported in response to any other drug or intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of cartilage in the human body. One, hyaline cartilage, is smooth and glossy, providing a low-friction surface for lubrication and flexibility in joints like the ankles, hips, shoulders and parts of the knee. Hyaline cartilage—also known as articular cartilage—is the cartilage most commonly affected by osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Osteoarthritis occurs when a joint is stressed by aging, injury, or obesity. The chondrocytes begin to release pro-inflammatory molecules and to break down collagen, which is the primary structural protein of cartilage. When collagen is lost, the cartilage thins and softens; the accompanying inflammation causes the joint swelling and pain that are hallmarks of the disease. Under normal circumstances, articular cartilage rarely regenerates. Although some populations of putative stem or progenitor cells capable of generating cartilage have been identified in bone, attempts to identify similar populations of cells in the articular cartilage have been unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research from Blau’s lab has shown that a molecule called prostaglandin E2 is essential to muscle stem cell function. 15-PGDH degrades prostaglandin E2. Inhibiting 15-PGDH activity, or increasing levels of prostaglandin E2, supports the regeneration of damaged muscle, nerve, bone, colon, liver, and blood cells in young mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blau, Bhutani and their colleagues wondered if 15-PGDH might also play a role in aging cartilage and joints. They wanted to find out if a similar pathway contributes to cartilage loss from aging or in response to injury. When they compared the amount of 15-PGDH in the knee cartilage in young versus old mice, they saw that, as in other tissues, levels of the gerozyme increased about two-fold with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They next experimented with injecting old animals with a small molecule drug that inhibits 15-PGDH activity — first into the abdomen, which affects the entire body, then directly into the joint. In each case, the knee cartilage, which was markedly thinner and less functional in older animals as compared with younger mice, thickened across the joint surface. Further experiments confirmed that the chondrocytes in the joint were generating hyaline, or articular, cartilage, rather than less-functional fibrocartilage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cartilage regeneration to such an extent in aged mice took us by surprise,” Bhutani said. “The effect was remarkable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar results were observed in animals with knee injuries like the ACL tears that frequently occur in people participating in sports such as soccer, basketball, and skiing that require sudden pivoting, stopping or jumping. While the tears can be surgically repaired, about 50% of people develop osteoarthritis in the injured joint within about 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a series of injections twice a week for four weeks of the gerozyme inhibitor after injury dramatically reduced the chance that osteoarthritis develops in the mice. The animals treated with the gerozyme inhibitor also moved more typically and put more weight on the paw of the affected leg than did untreated animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, prostaglandin E2 has been implicated in inflammation and pain,” Blau said. “But this research shows that, at normal biological levels, small increases in prostaglandin E2 can promote regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A closer investigation of the chondrocytes in the joints of old mice and young mice showed that old chondrocytes expressed more detrimental genes involved in inflammation and the conversion of hyaline cartilage to unwanted bone, and fewer genes involved in cartilage development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied human cartilage tissue removed from patients with osteoarthritis undergoing total knee replacements. Tissue treated with the 15-PGDH inhibitor for one week exhibited lower levels of 15-PGDH-expressing chondrocytes and lowered cartilage degradation and fibrocartilage genes than control tissue and began to regenerate articular cartilage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The mechanism is quite striking and really shifted our perspective about how tissue regeneration can occur,” Bhutani said. “It’s clear that a large pool of already existing cells in cartilage are changing their gene expression patterns. And by targeting these cells for regeneration, we may have an opportunity to have a bigger overall impact clinically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Phase 1 clinical trials of a 15-PGDH inhibitor for muscle weakness have shown that it is safe and active in healthy volunteers,” said Blau. “Our hope is that a similar trial will be launched soon to test its effect in cartilage regeneration. We are very excited about this potential breakthrough. Imagine regrowing existing cartilage and avoiding joint replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The specter of covid-19 continues to loom large over the United States. Research out today finds that the viral illness is still sickening and killing a substantial number of Americans every year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others examined surveillance data on covid-19 dating back to 2022. They estimated that covid-19 has annually caused millions of visits to the doctor, around a million hospitalizations, and roughly 100,000 deaths as of late. Covid-19 has been especially harmful to Americans over 65, highlighting the need for continued interventions such as booster vaccine shots, the researchers and other experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Although the Public Health Emergency for covid-19 ended in May 2023, this study suggests that covid-19 remains a major driver of mortality and hospital use among older adults,” David C. Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School who is not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Weakened but not gone&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The covid-19 pandemic wreaked plenty of destruction after its emergence in late December 2019. It likely &lt;a href="https://www.ncid.sg/News-Events/News/Pages/21-million-deaths---Over-7m-Covid-19-fatalities-recorded,-but-actual-number-may-be-3-times-higher-WHO.aspx#:~:text=NCID%20%3E%20News%20&amp;amp;%20Events%20%3E%20News,silently%20from%20long%2Dterm%20impacts."&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; over 20 million people worldwide in the first three years, including more than a million confirmed fatalities in the U.S.—the largest death toll for any pandemic in America. Many people also endured severe infections that sent them to the hospital, and others have experienced &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-challenges-of-unravelling-long-covid-1846644037"&gt;lingering bouts of chronic illness&lt;/a&gt; linked to the infection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most dangerous aspect of covid-19 was its novelty, however. The record-setting arrival of covid-19 vaccines by early 2021 helped significantly reduce the threat of the disease, as did the immunity we obtained from catching (and surviving) an infection. As a result, covid-19 deaths and other serious complications have noticeably become less common in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Covid-19 isn’t gone, though. It’s now an endemic disease, joining the long list of respiratory viral infections that can regularly make us sick or even kill us. So it remains important to know the burden of covid-19 in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this new study, the CDC authors analyzed data from COVID-NET, a surveillance program keeping track of covid-related hospitalizations. They focused on two time periods, about a year each: October 2022 to September 2023 and October 2023 to September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Based on this data, the researchers estimated that covid-19 sickened 43 million Americans between 2022 and 2023; it also sent 10 million people to their doctor, caused 1.1 million hospitalizations, and killed 101,300 people. Between 2023 and 2024, they estimated that covid-19 sickened 33 million Americans, caused 7.7 million outpatient visits, 879,100 hospitalizations, and 100,800 deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These numbers are far below the peak of the pandemic in the U.S. In 2021, for instance, covid-19 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm"&gt;officially killed&lt;/a&gt; over 400,000 Americans. But the annual death toll of covid-19 between late 2022 and 2024 likely still eclipsed that of any other single infectious disease (last winter’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html"&gt;especially bad flu season&lt;/a&gt; being a possible exception).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Despite declines in illnesses, outpatient visits, and hospitalizations from 2022-2023 to 2023-2024, covid-19 imposed a large annual impact in the US.,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.7179?guestAccessKey=c26397f8-3193-499d-a048-281b78b4d8b6&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=010526"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do about covid&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While covid-19 can sicken and cause severe illness to anyone, it’s riskier for certain populations, particularly the elderly. And that added risk hasn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 2023 and 2024, for instance, Americans over 65 represented nearly half of all covid-19 infections, roughly two-thirds of hospitalizations, and over 80% of all deaths, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There is also evidence that covid-19 has continued to decline in overall severity. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm"&gt;provisional data&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC, covid-19 may have only caused 20,000 reported deaths in 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These harms, reduced as they are, are still real and, in many cases, preventable. Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/new-data-underlines-impact-covid-19-booster-vaccines"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that booster vaccinations can further lower the risk of severe covid-19, particularly in older people. There are also available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/treatment/index.html"&gt;antiviral treatments&lt;/a&gt; that might prevent severe illness if taken soon after the infection starts.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Grabowski notes, however, that many of the most vulnerable Americans, such as nursing care residents, are not keeping up to date on their booster doses. And his own research has &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2807529"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that nursing home residents often aren’t even given antivirals once they get sick. So more needs to be done to encourage the use of these interventions and to create better living conditions for nursing home residents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Older adults should look to avoid overcrowded nursing homes and other group living environments where COVID-19 can spread quickly. They should seek out settings with single occupancy rooms, better ventilation, and improved infection control practices,” said Grabowski, who wrote an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2843387"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Covid-19 isn’t the cataclysmic natural disaster it once was, thankfully. But it’s here to stay, and it’s still hurting plenty of people.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Those immune cells subsequently engulf cholesterol particles that are typically floating around in the blood stream to form a fatty plaque that resides in the wall of the vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process continues for decades until eventually, one day, immune mediators rupture the cap that encloses the plaque. This triggers the formation of a blood clot that obstructs blood flow, starves the surrounding tissues of oxygen and ultimately causes a heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, cholesterol is only part of the story; it is, in fact, the immune system that facilitates each step in the processes that drive heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="3b179384-efa8-49e5-b6f5-eb61198860ce"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Fatty plaque buildup in the arteries causes a blockage that starves tissues of oxygen and can lead to a heart attack or stroke. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: wildpixel / iStock via Getty Images Plus)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-0a8f51ac-5c7d-4a0f-b4aa-e6fa92c3da02" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-diet-influence-c-reactive-protein-levels-3"&gt;Can diet influence C-reactive protein levels?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="f1cbdae7-a65d-402b-bc4b-509189e48c59"&gt;Lifestyle can significantly influence the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319885458" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487319885458" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;amount of C-reactive protein produced by the liver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous foods and nutrients have been shown to lower C-reactive protein levels, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2014.959898" data-url="https://doi.org/10.3109/09637486.2014.959898" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dietary fiber from foods like beans, vegetables, nuts and seeds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.110922" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2019.110922" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;berries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2025.2525446" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2025.2525446" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;olive oil&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2019.08.019" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctim.2019.08.019" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;green tea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-024-00847-3" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12986-024-00847-3" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chia seeds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Two people with the same cholesterol level don’t necessarily have the same risk for heart disease. This is because risk is determined more so by the number of particles that the bad cholesterol is packaged into, as opposed to the total mass of bad cholesterol that’s floating around. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068885" data-url="http://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.068885" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;More particles means higher risk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why a blood test known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24992-apolipoprotein-b-test" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/24992-apolipoprotein-b-test" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;apolipoprotein B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which measures the number of cholesterol particles, is a better predictor of risk for heart disease than &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.5083" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2021.5083" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measurements of total amounts of bad cholesterol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="68f4ad2d-14d6-4e17-98b4-913802c4f734"&gt;Like cholesterol and C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B is also influenced by lifestyle factors &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://doi.org/10.1055/a-2580-0722" data-url="http://doi.org/10.1055/a-2580-0722" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;like exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-019-1094-4" data-url="http://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-019-1094-4" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;weight loss&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and diet.

Doctors should still make Pap smears available, the guidelines say, though they’re no longer the preferred cervical cancer screening method for women ages 30 and up. HRSA still recommends Pap smears every three years for women ages 21 to 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0ec9d4" class="body-graf"&gt;Since most private health insurers are required to pay for preventive services recommended by HRSA, insurance companies must adhere to the new screening guidelines by Jan. 1, 2027, and will also be required to cover follow-up testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9c5501" class="body-graf"&gt;The new guidance &lt;a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/about/cervical-cancer-screening-update.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;reflects the latest research&lt;/a&gt; showing that HPV tests, compared to Pap smears, can increase the detection of abnormal cells in the cervix that may lead to cancer. &lt;a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/womens-guidelines-2016" target="_blank"&gt;Previous federal guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from 2016 recommended HPV tests and Pap smears every five years — or Pap smears every three years — for women ages 30 to 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7dcc1e" class="body-graf"&gt;Self-administered HPV tests involve inserting a plastic tube — similar to a tampon — into the vagina, then twisting the handle to swab for cells that can be examined in a lab. Pap smears, on the other hand, use a metal or plastic device called a speculum to widen the vaginal canal so a clinician can swab the cervix for cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53d384" class="body-graf"&gt;Studies have found that self-swab HPV tests are similarly accurate to ones administered by a clinician. Since 2024, the Food and Drug Administration has approved two self-swab tests that can be used in doctors’ offices, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/fda-approves-home-hpv-test-screen-cervical-cancer-rcna205713" target="_blank"&gt;an at-home test called the Teal Wand&lt;/a&gt; that can be ordered after a telehealth visit. The test is sold for nearly $250 out of pocket, though some insurance plans cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-990d2f" class="body-graf"&gt;In December, the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/american-cancer-society-recommends-self-swab-hpv-test-cervical-cancer-rcna247244" target="_blank"&gt;American Cancer Society updated its guidance&lt;/a&gt;  to endorse &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.70041" target="_blank"&gt;self-swab HPV tests every three years&lt;/a&gt; for women ages 25 to 65 — though it prefers a clinician-administered HPV test every five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d1762c" class="body-graf"&gt;While cervical cancer is highly preventable, rates are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/cervical-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;increasing year over year&lt;/a&gt; among &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/hpv-vaccine-cervical-cancer-rising-women-research-rcna134224" target="_blank"&gt;women in their 30s and early 40s&lt;/a&gt; — perhaps as a result of delayed screenings or missing out on HPV vaccinations, which were approved in 2006.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eggs aren’t just for breakfast.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Eggs are a nutritional powerhouse, with one egg containing six grams of high-quality protein and all nine essential amino acids, to help maintain and repair muscle while supporting bone health,” says Castillo.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, they can be quickly and easily prepared in lots of ways to suit different tastes, preferences and nutritional needs.

But new research suggests there’s one more lifestyle move that may help improve blood sugars: Sitting by a window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the major takeaway from a very small study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550413125004905" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell Metabolism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Researchers recruited 13 people with type 2 diabetes with an average age of 70. The participants, who did not wear sunscreen, spent 4.5 days in a room where they were exposed to natural light through large windows from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (They took their usual medications during that time.) The participants wore devices that continuously monitored their blood sugar levels during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/richard-siegel" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Richard Siegel, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Richard Siegel, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., an endocrinologist and co-director of the Diabetes and Lipid Center at Tufts Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, California; &lt;a href="https://www.dmrg.nl/people/staff/patrick-schrauwen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Patrick Schrauwen, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Patrick Schrauwen, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and researcher at the NUTRIM school for Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism; &lt;a href="https://www.unige.ch/medecine/diabetescentre/en/members/scientific-advisory-board/charna-dibner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Charna Dibner, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Charna Dibner, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and a professor in the Thoracic and Endocrine Surgery Division at University of Geneva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the study mostly sat at a desk where they had access to their phones and computers, with the screens set to a low brightness level. At night, they were exposed to dim artificial light (like from a lamp) and were allowed to use their devices until 11 p.m. They then slept in darkness until 7 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants ate three similar meals each day (which were designed to help them maintain their current weight). They also did the same exercises at certain points during the 4.5 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, the researchers had the participants do the same study in a windowless room with artificial light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After crunching the data, the researchers discovered that the participants’ blood sugar levels stayed within a “healthy” range 50% of the time during the natural light experiment. But when they replicated the experiment with artificial light, the participants were only able to hit that range 43% of the time. (The researchers defined “healthy” blood sugar in mmol—the measurement the U.K. uses—which translates to between 80 and 120 mg/dl.) “We showed that natural daylight had beneficial effects on 24-hour glucose, with volunteers spending more time in the normal glucose range, and with less variability,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dmrg.nl/people/staff/patrick-schrauwen/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Patrick Schrauwen, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Patrick Schrauwen, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and researcher at the NUTRIM school for Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact on blood sugar admittedly isn’t massive, and there are other factors to consider. But the research may hint at more. So, why might sunlight help with blood sugar management and how can you put this to work for you? Here’s what doctors who treat patients with diabetes want you to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might sunlight help with blood sugar management?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study didn’t dive into why this effect is there—it simply found a link. But it may come down to vitamin D exposure from sunlight, according to &lt;a href="https://www.tuftsmedicine.org/doctor/richard-siegel" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Richard Siegel, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Richard Siegel, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., an endocrinologist and co-director of the Diabetes and Lipid Center at Tufts Medical Center. He cites &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33020052/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that suggests vitamin D supplementation can help reduce the risk that someone with prediabetes will develop full-blown diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s researchers also suggest that light-sensitive cells in the eye may play a role in this impact, noting that they help regulate metabolic activity and tend to be more sensitive to shorter wavelengths from natural light. So, in theory, being exposed to natural light may help to regulate your metabolism and blood sugar management. The findings “may highlight the impact of natural daylight on our metabolism,” Dr. Schrauwen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali, M.D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, agrees with that theory. “Sunlight definitely plays a big role in our hormones and metabolism,” he says. “It makes sense that sunlight exposure can help the body’s metabolic processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Siegel points out that this is an associational study—meaning, the researchers didn’t prove that it was the natural light that caused this blood sugar change. &lt;a href="https://www.unige.ch/medecine/diabetescentre/en/members/scientific-advisory-board/charna-dibner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Charna Dibner, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Charna Dibner, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, study co-author and a professor in the Thoracic and Endocrine Surgery Division at the University of Geneva, agrees and notes that all of that daylight exposure may have helped increase levels of the sleep hormone melatonin in the evening, leading to better sleep. (Sleep is one lifestyle move that may help support blood sugar management.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also mostly included participants who were 65 and older, making it hard to apply the findings to a more general audience, Dr. Siegel says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might this fit into blood sugar management?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advice around blood sugar management won’t change based on these findings, Dr. Siegel says. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/treatment/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC) recommends doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track your blood sugar to see what makes it go up or down&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat at regular times, and don’t skip meals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose foods lower in calories, saturated fat, sugar, and salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Track your food, drink, and physical activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drink water instead of juice or soda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit alcoholic drinks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose fruit for a sweet treat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch food portions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably already know this, but it doesn’t hurt to repeat it: You should &lt;strong&gt;never change your blood sugar management plan without talking to your healthcare provider first.&lt;/strong&gt; Meaning, don’t cut back on your medication or other areas of treatment because you started sitting next to a window all day, Dr. Siegel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Schrauwen agrees. “The effects are likely too small to replace actual treatment in those already having diabetes,” he says. “Our results should be seen as another lifestyle factor that influences our metabolism and glucose homeostasis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study did not note if the added sunlight exposure impacted participants’ skin in any way (as UV light increases the risk of skin cancer). Still, getting some sunlight is needed, and sitting by a window can’t hurt. It’s just best to view this as an addition to your existing blood sugar management vs. an entirely new care plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 14:41:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOc3hIRVVsN2w5MlhuQWk3NjYxQzVNSmZqcVZFWWpObGRKMExvMlhzcGJKWnQwR3kyVFV2T2xjSlNCMHBoek1FVjZOMnJSTzRzWl9fbGNhS18wZWY3OXpnQ3ZBekJMRXhyejExYktnM0tUVXA5c3NiOTdUQ3lEVVNSNWNKZ3NuV1U</guid></item><item><title>视频：金毛猎犬以最甜蜜的吻回报小女孩的爱-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-golden-retriever-returns-little-143524575.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s nothing more precious than seeing a fur baby bonding and sharing a loving relationship with a little kid.

    &lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;On Nutrition&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the praise for plant-based eating, it’s easy to think that adopting a vegan diet — the most plant-based diet of all — will guarantee that you eat “healthy.” But will it? Research shows that plant-based diets can have higher levels of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and fiber, with lower levels of saturated fat. However, early plant-based research tended to gloss over the quality of the foods chosen. And it turns out that not all “plant-based” foods are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12206005/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; using data from 7,708 adult participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that eating a healthful plant-based diet was associated with having lower levels of a biomarker of heart attack risk, while those who ate an unhealthful plant-based diet had higher levels. A healthful plant-based diet is based on whole grains, pulses (beans, lentils, dry peas), vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, soybean products, tea and coffee, and vegetable oils (such as olive and canola). An unhealthful plant-based diet is one that’s high in sweetened beverages, refined grains and sweets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5555375/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;A 2017 Harvard study&lt;/a&gt; that included more than 200,000 adults was one of the first to sleuth out that when it comes to the plants you eat, quality and quantity both count. Researchers measured what proportion of each participant’s diet was plant-based, and whether those plant foods were healthful or unhealthful. They found that a diet rich in healthful plant foods was associated with substantially lower risk of developing heart disease, while a plant-based diet that emphasized less-healthful plant foods was associated with increased risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year before, the same researchers found &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4907448/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;similar results for risk of developing Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and subsequent research has observed that healthful plant-based diets are associated with reduced risk of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39442598/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38796844/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10800435/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40298944/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;poor cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;, while unhealthful plant-based diets are associated with increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that what you do eat matters as much as, if not more than, what you don’t eat, so when you focus on avoiding certain foods, you risk not seeing the forest for the trees. A vegan diet excludes all animal-based foods, including those high in saturated fat that can increase disease risk. But focusing too intently on those exclusions can result in a diet that’s not balanced or &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39936826/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;nutritionally adequate&lt;/a&gt;. Logically, a vegan diet that is full of refined grains, potato chips, sugar-sweetened beverages and coconut “milk” ice cream isn’t terribly healthful. This is one of the perils of demonizing specific foods — it’s your overall eating pattern that matters most for health and well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That 2017 Harvard study supports the value of a plant-rich (“plant-forward”) diet even for people who do choose to eat animal foods such as meat, poultry, fish, dairy or eggs. Individuals who ate the least plant foods were eating about five or six servings of animal foods per day, while those with the most plant foods were eating three servings of animal foods. This means that reducing animal foods even slightly while increasing healthful plant foods has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10447911/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link external"&gt;benefits for health&lt;/a&gt;, while allowing a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/from-vegan-to-omnivore-the-power-of-a-plant-forward-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link"&gt;flexibility with eating&lt;/a&gt;. Plant-based diets can take many forms, from vegan to vegetarian (which includes eggs and/or dairy foods) to &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/eating-vegetarian-is-good-for-you-and-the-environment-but-what-about-a-flexitarian-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link"&gt;flexitarian&lt;/a&gt; (a loose term that roughly means eating a lot of meatless meals) to &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/wellness/food-facts-is-an-omnivorous-diet-healthy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link"&gt;omnivore&lt;/a&gt;. What they all have in common is that they make plant foods the focal point of the plate. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team behind the study used a compound known as &lt;strong&gt;P7C3-A20&lt;/strong&gt; to restore normal levels of &lt;strong&gt;NAD+&lt;/strong&gt;, a molecule essential for brain cell energy and survival. The results, described as “striking” by the authors, open a new direction for Alzheimer’s research and raise cautious hopes about potential human applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease has long been considered a one-way path of decline, with treatments mainly aimed at slowing progression or delaying symptoms. Despite more than a century of study, no therapeutic strategy had ever succeeded in reversing the brain damage or memory loss associated with the condition. But researchers from &lt;strong&gt;University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;, along with &lt;strong&gt;Case Western Reserve University&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;, decided to test a radical question: what if the brain could bounce back?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their results, published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on December 22, 2025, reveal a possible turning point. By focusing on &lt;strong&gt;brain metabolism&lt;/strong&gt;, specifically the ability of cells to maintain adequate levels of NAD+, they found that even severely damaged brains in mouse models could heal, both structurally and functionally. According to the lead author, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/authored-by/Chaubey/Kalyani" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Kalyani Chaubey&lt;/a&gt;, the approach differs from other NAD+-boosting strategies, offering a controlled method that avoids dangerous side effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damaged Brain Tissue Restored After Late-Stage Intervention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research involved two well-established &lt;strong&gt;mouse models of Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt;: one mimicking amyloid buildup and the other simulating tau-related degeneration. Both models showed hallmark signs of the disease, including memory loss, blood-brain barrier breakdown, oxidative stress, and neuronal dysfunction. Importantly, these mice also showed a &lt;strong&gt;sharp drop in NAD+ levels&lt;/strong&gt;, mirroring what was found in human&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/scientists-just-reversed-alzheimers-mice/" data-type="post" data-id="100991"&gt; Alzheimer&lt;/a&gt;’s brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When scientists used &lt;strong&gt;P7C3-A20&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;restore NAD+ balance&lt;/strong&gt;, the results were more powerful than expected. Mice that had already reached an advanced stage of disease not only stopped declining but &lt;strong&gt;regained full cognitive function&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the study, this recovery included improved memory, normalized behavior, and even the repair of cellular structures that had been heavily damaged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As noted in the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00608-1?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666379125006081%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt;, P7C3-A20 restored long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, reversed tau phosphorylation, and repaired the blood-brain barrier, all of which are considered major pathological features of Alzheimer’s. In blood tests, levels of &lt;strong&gt;phosphorylated tau 217&lt;/strong&gt;, a clinical biomarker used in human diagnosis, also returned to normal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s Damage Tied to Metabolic Imbalance, Not Just Cell Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key insight of the study is that cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s may not always be due to &lt;strong&gt;irreversible neuron loss&lt;/strong&gt;, but rather to cells losing their ability to function due to &lt;strong&gt;energy imbalance&lt;/strong&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/education/cross-disciplinary-training-alzheimers-disease-translational-data-science/adtds-faculty/andrew-pieper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Andrew A. Pieper&lt;/a&gt;, senior author and Director of the Brain Health Medicines Center at UH, “&lt;em&gt;Restoring the brain’s energy balance achieved pathological and functional recovery in both lines of mice with advanced Alzheimer’s&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This challenges the widely held assumption that once neurons are lost, the damage is final. In fact, the study found that some brain regions showed &lt;strong&gt;no significant neuron death&lt;/strong&gt;, yet still presented major symptoms, which reversed once NAD+ levels were restored.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, P7C3-A20 works differently from over-the-counter supplements aimed at boosting NAD+. Unlike unregulated products that may flood the body with excess NAD+, which in animal studies has been linked to cancer, P7C3-A20 supports &lt;strong&gt;normal NAD+ homeostasis&lt;/strong&gt; during stress without pushing levels too high. Dr. Pieper warned that self-medicating with NAD+ supplements is not the same as the controlled pharmacological approach used in this research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving From Prevention to Potential Recovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of these findings could be wide-reaching. Unlike previous trials focused on prevention or slowing decline, this research suggests that recovery from Alzheimer’s symptoms may be possible, at least in certain cases. According to the data, &lt;strong&gt;P7C3-A20 &lt;/strong&gt;not only prevented the disease when given early but also reversed it when introduced during advanced stages, as demonstrated in both amyloid- and tau-driven mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The approach now needs to be tested in &lt;strong&gt;human clinical trials&lt;/strong&gt;, which the team is actively preparing. The compound is being commercialized by &lt;strong&gt;Glengary Brain Health&lt;/strong&gt;, co-founded by Dr. Pieper in Cleveland, to facilitate this transition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers remain cautious, acknowledging that &lt;strong&gt;mouse models do not fully replicate human Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt;, a “complex, multifactorial, uniquely human disease,” as Dr. Pieper told &lt;em&gt;Fox News Digital&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, the robust and repeatable effects observed in the study have opened a promising new path. While the team continues its work, attention is now turning to other &lt;strong&gt;age-related neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/strong&gt; that might benefit from the same strategy of restoring brain energy balance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the best ways to cook sweet potatoes to maximize both flavor and nutrition is roasting. “Roasting sweet potatoes with a small amount of oil allows the natural sugars to caramelize, creating a sweeter, more complex and slightly nutty flavor,” explains &lt;a href="https://marraburroughs.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marra Burroughs, D.C.N., RD&lt;/a&gt;, “Dry-heat methods like roasting also help preserve beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant and precursor to vitamin A. Beta-carotene is fat-soluble, so pairing sweet potatoes with a bit of healthy fat, such as olive oil, can also further enhance its absorption by the body,” Burroughs adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Burroughs says she leaves the skins on for added fiber and cuts the sweet potatoes into even-size pieces to help them cook more uniformly. Then, she tosses them in olive oil, and roasts them on a baking sheet at 450°F until they’re soft on the inside but crispy on the outside, 20 to 30 minutes. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-steamed-sweet-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Steamed Sweet Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://linkedin.com/in/avery-zenker" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Avery Zenker, M.A.N., RD&lt;/a&gt;, says she enjoys the caramelized flavor that roasting gives sweet potatoes, but recommends steaming them first to preserve even more nutrients. “The combination of steaming first to soften the potatoes, then roasting in the oven to develop flavor, helps reduce the amount of time sweet potatoes are exposed to the high and dry heat in the oven, and helps retain the nutrients. This allows the sweet potatoes to caramelize, but not become too brown, to balance maximum flavor with high nutrient content.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can try this at home by steaming halved sweet potatoes for about 15 to 20 minutes, then carefully coating them in olive oil and placing them cut-side down on a baking sheet before roasting them for another 10 to 15 minutes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because air fryers typically require less cooking time, cardiology dietitian &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about#/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt; recommends this method for preserving more cardioprotective nutrients like beta-carotene, vitamin C and potassium. Routhenstein notes that “adding a little healthy fat, such as avocado oil, helps your body absorb the fat-soluble [nutrient] beta-carotene, the antioxidant that gives sweet potatoes their orange color. Beta-carotene also helps reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are linked to heart disease.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to coating them in a healthy fat, Routhenstein enjoys sprinkling them with ground cinnamon to enhance their natural sweetness. When cut into wedges and air-fried at  400°F, they should take only 15 to 20 minutes to become crisp and delicious.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While boiling vegetables does cause some nutrients to leach into the water, &lt;a href="https://jordanlanghough.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jordan Langhough, RD&lt;/a&gt;, says that moist cooking methods create less oxidation, which, in turn, preserves more antioxidants. Langhough shares that boiling sweet potatoes can result in a lower glycemic impact compared to baking:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “The moisture from boiling [makes] the starches slower to digest, which means a more steady release of energy, which will [cause] blood sugar [to rise] more slowly.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get the most nutrients out of sweet potatoes, it’s important to know how to select them as well as how to store them. Here are some tips that can help you do just that.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look&lt;/strong&gt; for smooth, slightly shiny skin, and avoid those with blemishes and wrinkles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feel&lt;/strong&gt; for a dense, firm sweet potato with no soft spots. Fresh sweet potatoes are heavy due to their high water and nutritional content, becoming lighter and softer as they begin to decay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncooked&lt;/strong&gt; sweet potatoes should be stored in a cool, dark place with good air circulation. A paper bag inside a kitchen drawer is ideal. Avoid washing them before use, and do not place them in the refrigerator or next to other fruits and vegetables, as they emit gases that can cause premature decay.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooked&lt;/strong&gt; sweet potatoes should be cooled completely before storing. Place them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days or in the freezer for up to a year. Leftover sweet potatoes that are chilled or reheated can actually contain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;more resistant starch&lt;/a&gt;, which is digested more slowly than ordinary starch. Its slowed digestion leads to potential health benefits like improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

That’s because symptoms often come and go, overlap with other conditions or are simply too nonspecific to raise immediate concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As a result, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/vasculitis-know-disorder-knocked-ashton-211002943.html" data-ylk="slk:autoimmune diseases;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt; can quietly hide in plain sight. When they do emerge, “depending on the extent of the disease, it can affect a person’s ability to do everyday activities such as working, eating certain foods or even caring for themself,” says Dr. Stephanie Sasha De La Guarda, a family medicine physician at Baptist Health South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Understanding what autoimmune diseases are, what triggers them and how they’re treated can be a powerful first step toward clarity, proper care and lasting relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="-mx-4 mb-5 max-w-[750px] md:mx-0"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="mx-4 md:mx-0"&gt;&lt;div class="my-2 flex items-center justify-between"&gt;&lt;h2 class="text-base font-bold text-primary"&gt;James Van Der Beek, Celine Dion, more stars open up about their health struggles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="whitespace-nowrap text-sm"&gt;&lt;span class="ml-1 font-normal text-primary"&gt;&lt;span class="font-bold text-hulk-pants dark:text-thanos"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span&gt;66&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="relative text-sm pr-2.5 text-tertiary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrities such as &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/books/2022/05/20/selma-blair-talks-past-trauma-hollywood-in-mean-baby-memoir/9803652002/"&gt;Selma Blair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/06/01/red-table-talk-jada-pinkett-smith-alopecia-chris-rock-oscars/7466477001/"&gt;Jada Pinkett Smith&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/life/people/2017/07/21/selena-gomez-style-diary/103888776/"&gt;Selena Gomez &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/07/19/justin-bieber-resumes-justice-world-tour-ramsay-hunt-diagnosis/10101389002/"&gt;Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt; have embraced speaking out about ongoing health issues, encouraging fans to do the same.

Can autoimmune disease kill you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To have an autoimmune disease "means that the immune system – which normally protects the body from infections and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/causes-colon-cancer-prevent-090052817.html" data-ylk="slk:cancer;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; – mistakenly targets and attacks the body’s own healthy tissues,” says Dr. Alexandra Reese, a rheumatologist at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Instead of recognizing organs, joints or glands as “self,” immune cells misidentify them as threats and mount a chronic inflammatory response. Over time, this persistent immune attack "can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction,” says Reese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Autoimmune disease is so widespread in part because there are &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/autoimmune-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:between 80 and 150;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;between 80 and 150&lt;/a&gt; autoimmune diseases, each affecting different parts of the body.

Muscle weakness, swelling, rashes, digestive issues and brain fog are other commonly reported associated issues that can affect one's lifestyle and livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And while some autoimmune diseases are mild or intermittent, others are progressive and potentially life-threatening, particularly when vital organs such as the kidneys, lungs, heart or nervous system are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MS is more common than you think: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/christina-applegate-selma-blair-john-100157260.html" data-ylk="slk:Christina Applegate, Selma Blair and John King have it.;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Christina Applegate, Selma Blair and John King have it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What causes autoimmune disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Autoimmune diseases arise from a complex interplay of genetics, environmental exposures and immune system dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Genetics alone are rarely enough to cause the disease. Environmental factors “such as smoking or chemical pollutants” also appear to play a significant role, says De La Guarda. She adds that viral and bacterial infections are also among the most studied triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/nearly-every-woman-experiences-hot-100058067.html" data-ylk="slk:Hormonal influences;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Hormonal influences&lt;/a&gt; are also important, says Reese, particularly because autoimmune diseases disproportionately affect women and often emerge during reproductive years or following major hormonal shifts such as pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In many cases, it’s a combination of factors. “Some diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, are thought to result from a ‘two-hit phenomenon,'" says Reese, "where a person has a genetic predisposition and then encounters an environmental exposure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Other contributors may include chronic stress, poor sleep and disruptions to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/articles/improving-gut-health-more-help-090234971.html" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.

That's likely because, when the balance of gut bacteria is disturbed, immune regulation may falter, increasing inflammation and susceptibility to autoimmune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noted: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://health.yahoo.com/articles/improving-gut-health-more-help-090234971.html" data-ylk="slk:Improving gut health can do more than help digestion;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Improving gut health can do more than help digestion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How are autoimmune diseases treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No matter what's behind them, autoimmune diseases generally cannot be cured. “But a variety of treatment options are available to help control symptoms, with the ultimate goal of preserving and improving patients’ quality of life,” says Reese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Treatment is highly individualized and depends on the specific disease, the organs affected and symptom severity. In clinical care, physicians aim to reduce immune system overactivity, control inflammation and prevent long-term damage, which is often done through medication. “Some of these medicines include insulin, thyroid &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/fda-removes-black-box-warning-161720905.html" data-ylk="slk:hormone replacement drugs;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;hormone replacement drugs&lt;/a&gt;, anti-inflammatory medications, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs,” says De La Guarda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For some patients, particularly during severe disease flares, hospitalization may also be necessary to stabilize organ function, manage pain or treat complications such as infections. Long-term care often also involves regular monitoring through blood tests, imaging and specialist visits to ensure disease activity remains under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At home, lifestyle strategies play an important supporting role. Adequate sleep, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:16;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/feeling-stressed-tips-reduce-stress-090009290.html" data-ylk="slk:stress management;cpos:16;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; and regular low-impact physical activity can all help reduce inflammation and preserve mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many patients also benefit from physical therapy, occupational therapy or counseling to address both the physical and emotional challenges of chronic illness. And while no single diet treats autoimmune disease, balanced nutrition that supports gut health and limits ultra-processed foods is recommended to improve overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Thanks to advances in diagnosis and treatment, "individuals with autoimmune diseases can live fulfilling lives by adhering to therapy, avoiding triggers, making healthy lifestyle changes and maintaining regular monitoring,” says Reese.

Most of us lurched into 2026 catastrophically depleted and grey-faced, juggling deep Lemsip dependency with a deeper overdraft and a sense of ever-deepening global geopolitical foreboding. There is, however, one thing that fills me with buoyant optimism now and always: science. I don’t understand it, but I’m delighted it’s out there, making things better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I was booted out of my leaden year-end listlessness by &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/2025/12/55-science-health-tech-facts-2025/685418/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Atlantic’s list of 55 Facts That Blew Our Minds in 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Did you know, for example, that &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu1052" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;scientists at UC Berkeley created a new colour&lt;/a&gt;? (It’s called “olo” and it’s sort of teal.) Or that doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/15/us-doctors-rewrite-dna-of-infant-with-severe-genetic-disorder-in-medical-first" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;treated a baby with a rare genetic disorder with custom gene editing&lt;/a&gt;? There were more wonders in the &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/eight-fascinating-scientific-discoveries-from-2025-that-could-lead-to-new-inventions-180987916/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Smithsonian’s list of last year’s fascinating scientific discoveries&lt;/a&gt;: ichthyosaurs, extinct marine reptiles, had “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09271-w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stealth flippers&lt;/a&gt;”, snails can &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-snail-can-regrow-its-eyes-and-understanding-how-may-one-day-help-humans-with-injuries-180987124/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;regrow eyes&lt;/a&gt; within a month, and “flamingos form tornado-like vortices as they probe for prey”, which is pure poetry (it looks pretty cool too, I &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cgcF8th5Nk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;watched one do it&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube). Still on an animal theme, entomologists discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ads4243" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“bone collector” caterpillar&lt;/a&gt; that conceals itself in the body parts of its prey (I’m sure he’s lovely when you get to know him). 2025 was also the year science made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmlF2rw1weo" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;oyster mushrooms play keyboards&lt;/a&gt; (sort of), astronomers discovered &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2500310-more-than-100-moons-were-discovered-in-our-own-solar-system-in-2025/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than 100 moons&lt;/a&gt; in our solar system and medical researchers created &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/23/scientists-create-replica-human-womb-lining-and-implant-early-stage-embryos" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;replica womb lining&lt;/a&gt; and made astonishing progress towards &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/lab-grown-teeth-might-become-an-alternative-to-fillings-following-research-breakthrough" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;lab-grown teeth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Science is awe-inspiring; it’s the one thing that makes me really look forward to 2026. I know big brains are already working tirelessly on the stuff we’re desperate for them to sort out: climate collapse, plastic waste and ecosystem failure; cures for dementia and cancer and the chronic conditions, such as long Covid, that blight the lives of many of my loved ones and yours. But smaller stuff is cool too. Far be it from me to try to direct the course of human inquiry, but I have a few suggestions of projects that would sit well on a “mind-blowing discoveries” list this time next year. I can’t manage 55, but here are nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Are we really sure &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/14/should-i-worry-about-how-long-i-spend-sitting-down" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sitting down is bad for us&lt;/a&gt;? It would be great if someone clever took another look at that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It was cool when you discovered a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/31/big-stick-insect-acrophylla-alta-found-north-queensland-trees" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;supersized stick insect&lt;/a&gt; last year, guys, and I loved &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2025/december/natural-history-museum-describes-262-new-species-2025.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;all the new insects generally&lt;/a&gt; – four new wasps! Wow! Just a suggestion, but I think global morale would be vastly improved by the discovery of a new cute, fluffy mammal. Maybe keep a lookout while you’re wasp hunting?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Live translation software has become incredible: I recently read about &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/26/travel/airpods-live-translation-japan.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a journalist going round Japan using it&lt;/a&gt; with astonishing success. This year it needs to tackle the real challenge: pets. You want to know if your cat loves you? I hope you’re ready for the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Earworm removal. I can’t cope with another year of my husband humming The Muppets theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I have two alternative renewable energy sources I suggest we investigate: scrolling – we’re all doing it, couldn’t we be hooked up to something to generate power with our fingers? Also: middle-aged female rage. Show me an unemptied bin and I could easily power the National Grid for 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I’m a keen follower of research that suggests how short bursts of exercise can improve your health – the finding announced last week that &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/d7a3cee2-9070-4d78-9699-13f6e525a524?shareToken=7e90af1f9665a1f5251921bd572a2f7a" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;10 minutes’ exercise could help protect against the progression of bowel cancer&lt;/a&gt; was excellent. Perhaps this year, slumping over to the fridge could be discovered to have unexpected health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Speaking of exercise, I know &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/14/carlo-rovelli-exploding-commonsense-notions-order-of-time-interview" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;time is relative&lt;/a&gt;, but physics needs to explore what happens when you run on a treadmill. Civilisations rise and fall, geological eras pass, and the digital display still says four minutes. Make it make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wearable technology has made great strides (unlike me on a treadmill), but it needs to tackle one of humankind’s biggest problems: bedtime procrastination. I want a wearable that, come 10pm, undresses me, brushes my teeth, then airlifts me to bed in the efficient if undignified way they &lt;a href="http://bbc.com/future/article/20250327-the-vietnam-war-helicopters-riddled-with-bullet-holes-airlifting-rhinos-to-safety" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rehomed that rhino last March&lt;/a&gt;. Failing that, I would settle for one that administers an electric shock of increasing intensity every five minutes I loll on the sofa post-bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Geese: we urgently need to work out what their angry deal is.

Build muscle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Skeletal muscle is the largest site of glucose disposal in your whole body,” noted Julie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Basically, what that means is that when you eat a carb, it turns into sugar in your blood. That sugar has to go somewhere. And the place of storage is your muscle.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we work (contract) our muscles, they pull the sugar out from the blood and store it there. Utilising more muscles results in more sugar being pulled out of the blood and the body requiring less insulin to manage the remaining blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A well-established method to build muscles is through weight or resistance training. “Resistance training increases something called GLUT4 (Glucose Transporter Type 4) for the muscles,” explained the fitness coach. “GLUT4 allows glucose to enter the muscle without causing large insulin spikes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Resistance training helps with insulin resistance even without weight loss. As such, many women who do only cardio stay insulin resistant, she highlighted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Eat protein first&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While increasing protein intake is essential, the order in which we eat our meals also has an important role to play. Starting our meals with protein leads to smaller glucose spikes as the sugar enters our bloodstream more slowly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Slower digestion equals lower insulin response. And lower insulin response means better sensitivity over time,” noted Julie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;It is also a great tip for those who feel “snacky or exhausted after meals,” as the condition can be caused by not having enough protein or not eating meals in the right order, such as eating carbs first.&lt;/span&gt; This leads to getting full and not finishing the proteins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A good goal is having one gram of protein per pound of goal body weight,” added Julie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Walk post-meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie claimed that she could not overstate the importance of postprandial walks, or short walks taken immediately after meals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I repeat myself because I know that this is gonna make your life so much better,” she shared. “And it doesn't need to be a long walk. Light movement post-meals has been shown to increase glucose uptake by the muscles almost immediately. And studies show that it could reduce those glucose spikes by 20 to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Regulate sleep and stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep and stress have a major effect on overall health, and insulin resistance in particular, revealed Julie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Sleep deprivation alone can induce insulin resistance because short sleep increases cortisol, and cortisol blocks insulin signalling,” she explained, suggesting that getting a sleep tracker might help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Data to drive behaviour&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My last tip is to use data to drive behaviour,” noted the fitness coach. “And what I mean by that is you can't really improve what you don't measure. You can't really build muscle if you're not keeping track of your lifts.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to calorie intake, Julie said that most people underreport calories by 20 percent. This means that some people can eat too little instead of too much. Taking thehelp of an app and tracking what we are eating every day can give us a better idea of what actually needs to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Her humans at @lexi_girl_goldenretriever just happened to be filming when Lexi looked at a public fountain and clearly thought, yes, this pool will do. In the viral video, this adventurous &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; ignores the intended purpose of the stone structure. And tries to force a spa day, instead. It’s one of those moments that makes you nod if you’ve ever lived with this breed — water first, details later. It’s the scramble that gets you — halfway clumsy, halfway determined, and very on brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Owner explains Golden Retriever’s logic behind taking dip in fountain thinking it’s a pool&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lexi starts by propping her front paws onto the edge of the fountain. She doesn’t hesitate before splashing her legs into the main bowl.On-screen text pops up saying, “Golden Retriever Logic: If it has water, it’s a pool,” which honestly explains everything that follows. Lexi isn’t one to let a little thing like “public decorum” stand in the way of a good cool soak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It does, however, get a bit clumsy once she tries to pull her back legs into the mix. Lexi is a big girl, and this fountain was definitely not designed for a full-grown dog. She slips once, wobbles, and somehow wedges herself between the bowl and a stone slab. It looks incredibly uncomfortable, but she manages to squeeze her fluffy body into the tiny space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soon though she realizes the “pool” is a bit of a tight fit. She hops out gracefully and immediately gives a massive shake, spraying water everywhere. Fans loved the clip, with one viewer noting that their own dog, Blaze, does the exact same thing.

The actual problem arises, not from insulin's basic existence, but when it is too much, exceeding the normal levels, which is when cells stop reacting to it. This is called insulin resistance, and it is a major health concern as it is associated with weight gain, inflammation, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and fatigue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the doctor assured that insulin sensitivity can improve, and it is very changeable:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Move your muscles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first recommendation to reduce insulin sensitivity is to move your muscles. Dr Khan stated that muscles act like insulin sponges. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Explaining this, he said, “When you move, particularly things like strength training, brisk walking, short bursts of higher effort, your muscles take up glucose without needing much insulin." But one doesn't need to spend hours in the gym because, as per the doctor, consistent activity matters more than intensity. What does this mean? If you regularly incorporate movement into your day, even if for a few minutes, such as brisk walk after meals, your health improves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Give insulin a break&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often you eat can impact insulin levels and, in turn, insulin sensitivity too. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Dr Khan asserted that insulin is actually meant to rise and fall, not stay elevated for extended periods, reiterating that you should avoid keeping insulin switched on all day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;How do you prevent?&lt;span class="highlight"&gt; He said, “Things that can help with that are leaving gaps between meals, reducing constant snacking, and eating meals that include protein, fibre, and healthy fats.&lt;/span&gt;” When you follow these practices regularly, the cells become more responsive to insulin levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Sleep more, stress less&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep and stress are equally important when it comes to insulin regulation. A chain reaction occurs: when you sleep less, cortisol rises, and this stress hormone is also responsible for increasing blood sugar. The doctor noted that even a few nights of poor sleep can affect insulin. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;The key point to remember, according to Dr Khan, is that insulin is not the main culprit, but when it is overworked, the body's system breaks down, leading to fatigue, weight gain, and long-term metabolic issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

&lt;p&gt;Williams, 69, has survived a fall while home alone, a brain bleed, a coma for nine days, and in-bed surgery to drain fluid buildup in his brain — and a major recovery effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s at least three times I could have easily died,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfpti.com/our-team/"&gt;Williams&lt;/a&gt; had previously spent his days overseeing the delivery of radiation therapy to patients as the director of &lt;a href="https://protonintl.com/locations/south-florida-proton-therapy-institute/"&gt;The South Florida Proton Therapy Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Delray Medical Center. But on the first Saturday in March, he was at his Lake Worth Beach home, alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sara, his wife of only a few months, was hundreds of miles away in Washington, D.C., and felt something was wrong when her husband didn’t respond to her morning calls and texts. She asked a neighbor to check on him. The neighbor found Williams semi-conscious on the floor with a bruise on his head and called for an ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams said when the emergency crew arrived, his brain was in  an “active bleed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear if the otherwise healthy doctor fell and hit his head, causing the brain bleed, or if an aneurysm caused the bleed and fall. Regardless, his medical condition became precarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is as if your body is an hourglass, and every second that passes places you in more peril as your life force is leaking out through the bottom,” he said. “If appropriate care isn’t delivered within time, the sand runs out, and your next stop is the funeral home. No one on earth knows the exact amount of time you have left. One thing is clear, though, is that there isn’t much. It is measured in minutes, not hours.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Inside the ambulance, his condition deteriorated quickly. Emergency crews typically take patients to the nearest hospital, but they suspected a stroke and took Williams to Delray Medical Center, a recognized &lt;a href="https://www.palmbeachhealthnetwork.com/news/newsroom/2024/07/29/delray-medical-center-is-nationally-recognized-for-its-commitment-to-providing-high-quality-stroke-care"&gt;Comprehensive Stroke Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there is one thing I am sure of, it is that if it weren’t for the quality and professionalism of the physicians and staff at Delray Medical Center, I would have died. I’m a very lucky guy. My journey has taken me from being perhaps 15 minutes from death to an almost complete recovery.” — Dr. Tim Williams&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Williams wrote a thank-you letter to the hospital staff describing the events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been on the staff at Delray Medical Center since 1989 and served four years as a member of the senior governing board. None of this was known to anyone involved on the morning of March 1, 2025, when the ambulance picked me up, near death, on the floor at the foot of my bed,” Williams wrote. “My neurologist would later tell me that, at the time, I only had perhaps another 20 to 30 minutes to live.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Hospital staff immediately took a scan that showed a severe brain bleed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They couldn’t tell if it was a full-blown stroke or aneurysm or any of that, but they did see blood,” Sara Williams said. “So it was just kind of a waiting game to see if the blood would drain the normal way, but it didn’t. He just got worse and worse and worse.”&lt;/p&gt;

(Sara Williams/Courtesy)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three days, Williams drifted in and out of consciousness, only to suffer a huge setback. He became completely confused, an indication of fluid buildup in his brain. The staff did another MRI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Completely unconscious, blood pressure dropping, I was hauled immediately back to radiology for an emergency MRI scan of my brain,” Williams said. “The images were bleak. Blood was everywhere. … This prompted a spinal tap, which showed blood around my spinal cord. And, as if that wasn’t enough, my brain was swollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was dying, again,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurosurgeon &lt;a href="https://www.palmbeachhealthnetwork.com/find-a-doctor/detail/ronald-young-1235131103"&gt;Dr. Ron Young&lt;/a&gt; arrived to see his friend in trouble. “When I got there, he was barely responding at all,” Young said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no time to secure an operating room, Young called for a craniotomy tray and, at the bedside, drilled a hole in Williams’ scalp. He stuck a small drainage tube into the middle of Williams’ brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within a few minutes, he was more responsive and started talking,” Young said. “Bleeds are relatively common. We see this fairly often. Not finding the cause is quite uncommon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young said it’s a true miracle that Williams survived all he endured: “If appropriate treatment isn’t delivered, outcomes are poor,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after Young drained the fluid, Williams slipped into a coma, where he remained for nine days. During that time, he battled aspiration pneumonia, yet he doesn’t remember anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he finally awoke, he had a long, hard recovery ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was not mobile whatsoever,” Sara Williams said. “The physical therapy staff came for the first time to stand him up and get him out of the bed, and that’s when we found out that he wasn’t able to walk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At rehab, Williams underwent physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 43 days at Delray Medical Center and then its rehabilitation facility, Williams finally went home — still unable to fully walk or use his hands and struggling with short-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

(Carline Jean/South Florida Sun Sentinel)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we came home, it was actually the scariest part of the whole ordeal,” his wife said. “He was tired a lot. He could not tolerate a lot of motion or activity around him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t summer camp, but I did everything I was told, worked hard, and did as much as possible to assist with my own recovery,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a patient, rather than a doctor, Williams says he has seen health care from a different perspective: “If there is one thing I am sure of, it is that if it weren’t for the quality and professionalism of the physicians and staff at Delray Medical Center, I would have died. I’m a very lucky guy. My journey has taken me from being perhaps 15 minutes from death to an almost complete recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine months after his ordeal started, Williams says he still tires easily and describes himself as 80% back to normal. “I don’t think I’ll ever get back to 100,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He doesn’t plan to return to work in the same capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My clinical days are pretty much done. It’s too stressful. There’s too medical decision-making,” he said. Instead, he plans to conduct research in radiation oncology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of measles and whooping cough in Oklahoma have led to calls for greater transparency from the Oklahoma State Department of Health as the state stands alone in only sharing measles cases on a statewide basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease and public health experts said the timely sharing of cases with the public can help communities mitigate the spread of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. George Monks, a Tulsa dermatologist and former president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, has been trying for months to get the state Health Department to share more data. He’s employed social media cajoling, open records requests and complaints to the attorney general’s public access counselor, to no avail. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“This data is crucial for Oklahoma families to make informed decisions about their health, whether it be vaccine choice or avoiding high-risk areas,” Monks said. “Withholding that county-level measles data could delay the community response, especially since it is so contagious.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, Oklahoma has recorded 17 cases of measles in 2025. Nationally, the United States has had the highest number of measles cases in three decades. More than 800 of the 2,000 U.S. cases this year came in Texas back in the spring, although &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/tuesday-measles-update-dph-reports-nine-new-measles-cases-upstate-bringing-outbreak-total-153"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt; is dealing with a current outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, airborne virus with symptoms including rashes, high fevers, coughs, runny nose and red, watery eyes. The virus spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can linger for up to two hours in a room after exposure.  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Monks first requested measles case data by county in March, along with agency communications with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about a measles outbreak in Oklahoma. The state Health Department provided some email correspondence with CDC, but it cited a section of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, in declining to release county measles data. Monks shared his requests and responses with Oklahoma Watch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its Oct. 30 letter siding with the state Health Department, the attorney general’s office said the agency’s response was reasonable and noted its website has statistical information related to measles and potential public exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Based on the information available to me at this time, I conclude that OSDH has a good-faith legal basis to deny access to the records sought by Dr. Monks,” wrote Anthony Sykes, the attorney general’s public access counselor. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma is the only state not providing measles cases by county or on a regional level, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They published a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2839096"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in September in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, detailing their efforts to develop the &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/resources/us-measles-tracker"&gt;U.S. Measles Tracker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kansas only withholds county-level measles data if the cases are fewer than five, the researchers noted. Tennessee, Utah and Iowa provide regional case data, but not by county. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Single measles cases often represent the leading edge of potential outbreaks, making their rapid identification crucial for public health response,” the researchers said in a supplemental paper describing their methodology. “Geographic specificity, even for small case counts, enables public health officials to implement targeted contact tracing and exposure notifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many state health departments routinely report individual measles cases in public communications, press releases, and exposure notifications, establishing precedent that individual case disclosure serves legitimate public health purposes.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma used to disclose county-level measles cases as recently as 2019, during the last major measles outbreak. Media reports from that outbreak show measles in Okmulgee County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an emailed response to questions from Oklahoma Watch, the state Health Department said its public data is sufficient to inform local communities of potential exposure to measles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It provides overall case counts, vaccination status, age range, median age of cases and any public exposure settings identified through investigation of a measles case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Identified exposure locations are what pose a risk of spread to the public, and the county of residence may not always reflect the population or communities that may be at risk during a public health investigation,” the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Health Department didn’t directly address questions on how other states are able to report county measles data. The agency said it continues to rely on its interpretation of federal HIPAA laws and Oklahoma’s public health code in not releasing county-level measles data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Accordingly, OSDH has the discretion to determine the manner in which statistical communicable disease data may be released to the public to the extent that such release is in compliance with de-identification and disclosure requirements of HIPAA,” the department said in the email. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echoes of COVID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The debate over how and when to share infection data echoes those in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Oklahoma was &lt;a href="https://oklahomawatch.org/2020/03/28/as-covid-19-cases-spread-state-officials-release-few-local-details/"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://oklahomawatch.org/2020/06/01/oklahoma-pulls-back-on-coronavirus-data-transparency/"&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; community-level &lt;a href="https://www.kjrh.com/news/local-news/local-health-officials-create-new-high-risk-zone-map-based-on-local-data"&gt;infection data&lt;/a&gt;. Even then, it provided county-level case information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those first few months of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/6820310-OSDH-Open-Records-Request-Oklahoma-Watch-3-20-20/"&gt;Oklahoma Watch requested&lt;/a&gt; de-identified COVID-19 data from the state Health Department, including by city and ZIP code. Officials initially denied the request based on federal and state privacy laws, although those laws include exemptions to allow de-identified data. As the pandemic escalated, state health officials eventually provided localized data for COVID infections on an online data dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Health Department said it used a risk-based approach to reporting COVID-19 cases to make recommendations around public gatherings and school closures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The only way to implement such a system was to report ZIP code-level data,” the department said. “For measles, using exact public setting location and time provides individuals the information necessary to communicate the risk to the public. Again, it’s all about risk and managing it in such a way as to balance the public’s need to know with our obligation to protect an individual’s health information.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Health Department sent out potential measles exposure alerts earlier this year. The alerts included the addresses of stores and restaurants an infected person had visited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma public health officials withholding of county-level measles data contrasts with the state’s &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/viral-view.html"&gt;tracking for West Nile virus&lt;/a&gt;, a mosquito-borne disease. The state Health Department’s infectious disease website includes the number of cases and county of incidence for that virus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t get it,” Monks said. “They’re citing these privacy concerns (for measles), but there’s no patient data assigned to this. It’s all just aggregate data. I don’t get how they can come down on one side and then a different side based on the infectious disease.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Health Department said decisions about releasing county-level data are made based on a number of factors, including overall case count, population of the county and case investigation impact. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For some diseases, like West Nile, it is important that the public is aware of the geographic location of the case to communicate the risk of disease to the public,” the agency said. “The majority of diseases publicly reported on our website are stratified by their respective region, rather than county-level, to help protect patient privacy, while still providing the public with a geographic distribution of disease burden.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monks continues to request disease data from the Health Department. He’s asked for more information about pertussis, commonly called whooping cough, and tuberculosis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a really important time to get this data out to the public,” Monks said. “In Oklahoma, this is the worst whooping cough outbreak in 70 years and the worst measles outbreak we’ve had in 35 years.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monks said it’s a policy decision, not necessarily a public health decision, to withhold detailed data about respiratory disease outbreaks. Monks, who describes himself as a Reagan Republican, suspects some state leaders don’t want to raise the ire of the federal Health and Human Services Department under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“From the Republican standpoint, some have taken this position that this is a political football, and they really want to get away from pro-vaccinations and pro-science, especially in a primary,” Monks said. &lt;/p&gt;

He stood up from his porch swing, unfolding his tall lean frame like a stork. His corporality shocked me; I realized I had been searching for him for so long — nearly three decades — that a part of me believed I would never find him. Unable to summon a single word, I locked eyes with him and tried to slow my racing thoughts, breathing in the dry Central Valley air. Finally, in a loud, clear voice he announced, “And you must be Heather.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6si2200193b7awn5h96p5@published" data-word-count="74"&gt;Hugging the man who had given me 23 chromosomes, whose eyes were the same icy-blue color as mine, whose ears, large and close to his head, resembled my sons’, felt like relief. I was surprised by the unexpected familiarity of his embrace. When he shared that “ever since Dr. Rock had said he’d been ‘successful,’ he’d wondered about me,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I was gratified that just as I had imagined him, so too had he imagined me.&lt;/p&gt;

But this was the first I’d heard that my conception had been anything out of the ordinary and that I might not be biologically related to my father. I began bombarding my mom with questions that she couldn’t answer. Finally, irritated at my inquisition, she waved her hands in the air and admonished me to “curb my wild imagination.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sijw001j3b7ad2tb3pyg@published" data-word-count="153"&gt;Having just endured my own &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/tags/infertility/"&gt;infertility odyssey&lt;/a&gt;, I knew that what she was suggesting was a biological impossibility: I couldn’t be the result of a sperm cocktail. Her insistence on this fiction made me wonder, &lt;em&gt;Was this it? Was this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the secret I’d sensed being kept from me in our tiny family of three my entire life?&lt;/em&gt; I remembered how often my parents had remarked over my blue eyes — “French blue,” my father called them, “like no one else’s in our family.” His eyes had been brown, my mom’s green. Sometimes I would hear them whispering my name when they thought I wasn’t around, or I would notice my father staring at me. When we looked at photos together, my mom was always quick to point out how similar my father’s and my profiles were. I caught myself running my finger up and down my nose, hunting for a bump like his.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sisr001k3b7aqb2ux5rp@published" data-word-count="56"&gt;My father died before home DNA testing had become as accessible as a trip to Duane Reade, when it was still expensive and difficult to solve questions of paternity. In the years following my mother’s confession, I tried to forge a fragile peace with the unsettling notion that I might never learn my biological father’s identity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sizo001l3b7a4g6blz1y@published" data-word-count="104"&gt;Then, when I was 62, over two decades after my father’s death and five years since my mother’s, I finally told my doctor the “mixing”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;story. To my surprise, she took me seriously and handed me an Ancestry DNA test, one of those you can order online for $40 and get results in a month. That’s when I learned about my half-sister — the simple fact of her existence proved definitively that I had been right. A friend later told me about DNAngels, an organization that helps unite family members, and eventually we connected. Tiffany is my almost-twin, just three days older than me.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sj4u001m3b7apk1a8k11@published" data-word-count="124"&gt;We began emailing, then talking on the phone, then texting, trying to untangle the various strands of our shared DNA.  She had never questioned her own birth story — she didn’t know if her parents had ever been patients of Dr. Rock — but she was eager to learn more. Four months after our first conversation, she drove from Pennsylvania to spend a summer weekend at our family’s log cabin in New Hampshire. While the ceiling fans whirred and we sipped hot coffee at the dining room table, we spread out photographs of us as children, and of our kids, as well as various family trees we’d constructed. We must be related through our paternal side, we figured, but the rest was a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;

Before we said good-bye, we agreed to schedule a fall visit to the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School, a library my father built. We spent the next few months following the winding trail of Dr. Rock’s papers, but we came away from our first visit disappointed. Because we were born in 1959, an era when donor inseminations were unregulated and anonymous, we had only guessed at which papers, among the thousands, to request.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sjlp001r3b7a0erqexrc@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;Now that we were invested in this search, neither of us could give up. Tiffany came back to Boston on a subzero January day, and we returned to the basement of the library together. When I had to leave for work, she kept digging. After she unearthed a list of men’s names, she texted me from the library, “struck gold.” Surmising that these names might belong to members of the Harvard Medical School class of 1960, she cross-checked every one. Early that spring, I drove south to Lancaster so we could compare our results. When I arrived, she handed me a yearbook. The man she had identified as our biological father stared back at us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sjsm001s3b7alv38avs3@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;Sitting at her kitchen island, together we scoured the internet for any crumbs we could find about him. We learned that he had lived in North Carolina, Hawaii, and finally California where he had practiced dermatology into his late 70s. He was on Facebook but hadn’t posted recently. Before we could chicken out, we messaged him saying only that we wanted to connect with him. But when he didn’t answer, we began to worry that we’d offended him. Tiffany suggested that, after I got home, we should enlist the DNAngels again. When they confirmed that he had to be our father, they produced his email, snail mail, and phone number and urged us to call him immediately — he was almost 90. I called Tiffany.&lt;/p&gt;

Before I slipped the letter in the mailbox, I snapped a photo of it and texted it to Tiffany. Once it was in the mail, we began counting days. Although we hoped he would respond, we volleyed back and forth the many reasons why he might not: Maybe he didn’t want his family to know about us; maybe he was concerned with protecting his privacy; maybe he just didn’t want to have anything to do with children resulting from sperm he had donated in secrecy 64 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6skfy001y3b7amn8aioua@published" data-word-count="32"&gt;His first email arrived in our inboxes three days later: “I have always wondered when this day would come. Happily, it is not from someone about to marry one of my children.”&lt;/p&gt;

Just as we wanted to know about him, he had even more questions for us. We traded long and friendly emails about our education, our careers, our kids, and his memories of working for Dr. Rock. Unlike my parents, he was forthcoming in his descriptions of the fertility clinic where he had donated sperm. He described the end of his first marriage, and his happiness in his second, as well as his pride in his four children. Although our father had three sons and one daughter, none had chosen to become parents. My sister’s two children and my three would be the first biological grandchildren he’d known. A few weeks into our correspondence, he invited us to visit him in California that summer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sko300213b7aspqqq0ol@published" data-word-count="123"&gt;My son and his wife drove Tiffany and me from Oakland to Sacramento where Dick, his wife, and two of his children were waiting for us. After greeting us on the porch, they ushered us into his plant-filled living room. On our way down the hallway, he pointed out several photos of his daughter and his sister that reminded him of us. After a brief silence, the seven of us sat down in a circle and began comparing eyes, ears, and noses. His son kept saying how strange it was to have us all in the same room, strangers who looked so alike. I sat beside his daughter and we pressed our palms together, noting the similarities in the shapes of our fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6skpo00223b7ar9q9qwjp@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;He was curious about how we had found him so we told him about our archival sleuthing. We asked him what he could remember about Dr. Rock. The fertility doctor had chosen him to be one of the fellows who operated the night switchboard. In return, he received a free room above the clinic. Whenever the doctor needed a sperm specimen for an insemination or for one of the research studies he was conducting, Dick obliged. For each donation, he was paid $25 — enough for him to eat out for a week in Boston. More recollections returned to him; he laughed when he told us that the doctor had also kept a stash of Swedish magazines just for his donors.&lt;/p&gt;

He’d spent his summers working in a grocery store and sailing in a small beach town on Cape Cod, a place I had often vacationed. Although he’d chosen to attend medical school, he’d been an English major who had also enjoyed writing poetry. He loved that I was a writer and that Tiffany was a doctor — “My two halves,” he joked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sl2s00243b7a89dpi1sm@published" data-word-count="121"&gt;A little over two years after that visit, I opened an email from his eldest son: “Dad passed away at home this morning, peacefully.” I was sitting in a friend’s knotty-pine-walled cabin on Mt. Desert Island in Maine. The mid-September night, just before the equinox, was filled with stars, and crickets chirped outside the door. Sinking into the soft gray couch, my small, scruffy black pup curled into me, I scrolled through my phone looking for his last text. Exactly two months earlier, I’d sent him a photo of my first grandson swaddled in a white blanket, taken at five hours old, his scrunched-up face red from the arduous journey to being born. Dick replied instantly, “How excited you must all be!”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6su7c002c3b7anbl7hiqp@published" data-word-count="105"&gt;With my parents gone for decades, having a father again had offered the reassurance and comfort provided by having another generation in front of me. Eager to see him again, Tiffany and I were talking about visiting him later in the fall, perhaps around Thanksgiving. We had penciled in the dates, but we hadn’t bought our tickets yet. Even though Dick had been in good health for his age, he was starting to slow down. Now I was chastising myself for not getting on a plane. It’s not exactly a surprise when someone in their 90s dies, but still, we’d thought we had more time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sl4k00253b7asiah0d0b@published" data-word-count="123"&gt;On that island in Maine, as the breeze blew through the window and my pup sighed, I wasn’t sure how to name what I was feeling. I remembered the way I had felt after my pregnancy losses — I’d had three miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy decades earlier — after the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of a baby had been ripped from me. I was mourning not only what was but what might have been, what I’d begun to let myself imagine. I felt grief for the man who had given me my cells and my life and grief for the man I had just been getting to know, for all that we might have learned about each other but now would not have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6sl9o00263b7az9yqkdks@published" data-word-count="158"&gt;As I considered the loss of this surprise father, two years after I’d first seen Dick stand up from his porch swing, I returned to my phone, searching for more evidence of our connection. I realized that we’d been in touch every few weeks since that hot and humid day he’d first reached out his arms to me. In June, I’d sent him a poem I’d recently published, “Sitting Out the Solstice Under a Japanese Maple Tree.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;He wrote back describing the covered porch swing he’d loved “on a corner of the pasture” surrounding the farmhouse he’d built in the Russian River valley. Although he’d moved by the time we met, he talked fondly of this place, this land where he’d raised his family. He described the view from the swing: “Of a tree on the distant hill which was my solstice tree. The sun stopped there and made its turn. Not there to see it this year and probably never again.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmjh6wrl4002y3b7akc16qlfd@published" data-word-count="61"&gt;Reading his message again, I noticed he’d sent it almost exactly three months before he died. At the time, I’d interpreted it as a wistful sort of remembrance. But now I saw it as more prophetic — he’d known he was near the end. And, in this poignant last text, he matched his poems to mine, his words a salve for my grief.&lt;/p&gt;

A video shared by @goldenchilidog on Instagram has been circulating around the internet. The video shows the winter routine of a dog named Chili, who can’t stop barking at rats. The clip amused viewers, and they flooded the comments section with love for the fur baby, calling him “too cute” and praising “Chili’s energy!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retriever even does it even when it’s snowy and everything is icy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This clip shared by @goldenchilidog on Instagram shows a dog enjoying time amid nature in the winter season, and the one usual activity he does every morning has left viewers amused. The video starts with the in-text title, “Morning routine of a lake dog winter edition,” and shows the Golden Retriever cuddling with his mom on the bed, enjoying his nap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next shot shows him wagging his tail as his mom asks for some more cuddles, and the video shows them bonding in the morning. The fur baby then relishes his breakfast as the lady prepares a cup of coffee for herself. It’s now time for Chili to go out and have fun. The dog goes to the lakeside that’s &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-shows-golden-retriever-loving-145521311.html" data-ylk="slk:frozen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;frozen&lt;/a&gt; and barks at it as the owner says, “Even in the winter, he is still looking for his muskrat,” further saying, “It is here, it is not imaginary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The dog keeps barking, but no &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/video-owner-pranks-3-dogs-065558271.html" data-ylk="slk:muskrat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;muskrat&lt;/a&gt; shows up, and he clearly looks disappointed. After barking at the lake to no avail, as he doesn’t see any muskrat, he doesn’t want to come back home. His mom asks him to come back and dry himself. After convincing him a lot, the dog finally gets back into the home and gets ready with help from his mom to go out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, as he still looks displeased, his owner tells him he will still find muskrat to bark at. After getting ready, they head out to a park, and while the lady is driving, she again jokingly asks, “Muskrat, where are you?” making the video even more hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/201089-golden-retriever-morning-routine-rats-muskrats-bark-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever’s Morning Routine Is Barking at Rats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Video: Golden Retriever’s Morning Routine Is Barking at Rats&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:33:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPS2pRZl82TktGTjRfV2hOZWJLV2RpN05pckZ4SC16U3dDM2VnNXA5MGpkN1V1T1hSMXcwM2IxR3F1QnZzR3ltVXZ4X1ZNTnZfMk85VWlIOXBWZVhFOUppdU9ZVmlNbEg1Ui1qV2NFd1FFemR1dWNCbV96LUZyYjdXdFFsWUVCQUJFeGRGalRvLTl2SGVJck42YkVR</guid></item><item><title>以色列科学家揭示大脑如何“清除垃圾”并可能传播阿尔茨海默氏症- Ynetnews</title><link>https://www.ynetnews.com/health_science/article/sk311qzo4be</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Israeli scientists reveal how brain 'takes out the trash', and may spread Alzheimer’s &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Technion researchers find protein-disposal system in brain cells may actually spread toxic proteins linked to Alzheimer’s; instead of destroying them, cells sometimes expel them to neighboring tissues, potentially accelerating disease progression in brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:52:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE5xT19XQTZtRHNSZjRKcXV5aEs3VmFzOWNteElSN293YVZfVHJZUURtYkR6dVFWWnB1Y1laQmsxeHJ2YnJRa2JFaGNoeWFyWldHNTd1N2VnR0otN3YzenhxdnlCVTEtZllwUmxn</guid></item><item><title>五种生活方式调整可帮助您长寿- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260102-five-lifestyle-tweaks-to-help-you-live-well-for-longer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;As Gow tells me, "If people don't believe change is possible, it's very unlikely that they're going to be open to an intervention… Increasing the knowledge of what we can do to protect and promote brain health, whatever age we are, is fundamental". For instance simple actions could be trying a new exercise, finding a new hobby or joining a book group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And for anyone ready to take these steps, combining changes in diet, exercise, cognitive training and cardiovascular health have been shown to have a significant improvement on brain health for older adults at risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This was shown in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23332672/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;the landmark Finger (Finnish Geriatric Intervention) study&lt;/a&gt;, which involved 1,260 participants aged 60 to 77 who were randomly assigned into either an intervention group, where they underwent a two-year programme of lifestyle interventions, or a control group, who simply received regular health advice. The study found that compared to the control group, participants in the intervention group showed up to 25% greater improvement in overall cognitive function, as well as improvements in memory and problem solving.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And finally, when I ask Gow what his suggestion is for how to think about making lifestyle changes, he says it's about making "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/healthy-cognitive-ageing-in-the-lothian-birth-cohort-studies-marg/projects/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;marginal changes today" and that there's no magic bullet.&lt;/a&gt; It's therefore clear that improvements across different areas of our life all add up and will provide us with lasting benefits, now and into the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;* &lt;i id="melissa-hogenboom-is-bbc-global's-senior-health-correspondent." class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Melissa Hogenboom is BBC Global's Senior Health Correspondent.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="--" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;--&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="for-trusted-insights-on-health-and-wellbeing,-sign-up-to-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;For trusted insights on health and wellbeing, sign up to the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/HealthFix_Newsletter_Signup?&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;amp;at_medium=emails&amp;amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;amp;at_ptr_type=&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;amp;at_format=Module&amp;amp;at_link_origin=featurescallout&amp;amp;at_campaign=healthfix&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="health-fix-newsletter" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Health Fix newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="by-senior-health-correspondent-melissa-hogenboom-who-also-writes-the" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; by senior health correspondent Melissa Hogenboom who also writes the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="http://www.bbc.com/newsletters?livewellforlonger?&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;amp;at_medium=emails&amp;amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;amp;at_ptr_type=&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;amp;at_format=Module&amp;amp;at_link_origin=dedicatedarticle&amp;amp;at_campaign=lwfl&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="live-well-for-longer" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Live Well For Longer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SixStepstoCalm_Newsletter_Signup?&amp;amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;amp;at_medium=emails&amp;amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;amp;at_ptr_type=&amp;amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;amp;at_format=Module&amp;amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;amp;at_campaign=sscalm&amp;amp;at_campaign_type=owned" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="six-steps-to-calm" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Six Steps to Calm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="courses." class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; courses. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;i id="for-more-science,-technology,-environment-and-health-stories-from-the-bbc,-follow-us-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;For more science, technology, environment and health stories from the BBC, follow us on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOWTZYUnUycWlqcUhMdzJ5RDNLck1sR3RBcDdOQkJOT2F2bVJacWRpQWNqUkNYd1hVeTZTMWxxcWJ5Z0VKQ3YxVDdKNmpUb2JsQWtTdnRrZXFPXzludmc1MmYzZlVuT01tdzd3aE41U3ExXzd1bFROdFlEdlRVeVplOWJSalAzNm83b0FWR08yWXFOQVdfMXdKZjIyQXNQcEU</guid></item><item><title>黄金猎犬和猫拥抱在一起，在搞笑视频中贴上“怪人”的标签-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-cat-cuddling-together-091327712.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You know that feeling when you walk into a room and instantly wish you hadn’t interrupted? That’s exactly how this video shared by @sometimesbesties begins. Mom heads into the living room, probably expecting a normal scene, and instead finds her &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt;, Harry, and his cat roommate, Sokka, locked in a cuddle situation that absolutely requires an explanation. Or maybe doesn’t. Either way, it stops her in her tracks. What’s unfolding on the couch looks equal parts affectionate and confusing. The kind of moment you only get when pets forget the rest of the world exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Mom dubs Golden Retriever and cat ‘weirdos’ after spotting unusual cuddle pose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Harry and Sokka are mid-snuggle when Mom approaches, and the timing could not be better. Sokka’s back legs are wrapped right around Harry’s snout, gripping his floppy cheek jowls in a way that makes it look like Harry is smiling on purpose. Harry, for his part, just freezes. He turns his head toward Mom and blinks slowly, like he’s silently asking for guidance — or rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mom starts laughing immediately and asks what on earth they’re doing. Sokka responds by casually twitching his legs, which only exaggerates Harry’s forced grin. Then it gets even better. Sokka brings his front paws into the mix and starts kneading Harry’s face like it’s fresh dough. Harry, on the other hand, doesn’t move an inch.
