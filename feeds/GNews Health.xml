(WKRC) - An 11-year-old girl who beat cancer allegedly died after the hospital gave her "excessive" pain medication instead of properly treating her, prompting a lawsuit from her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a lawsuit obtained by&lt;em&gt; Law&amp;amp;Crime&lt;/em&gt;, 11-year-old Ava Wilson's family filed a lawsuit against Advocate Children's Hospital regarding the way the organization treated Wilson's follow-up treatment after she began remission for b-lymphoblastic leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family claimed that during a follow-up appointment on Oct. 29, 2020, they told staff that Wilson was having difficulty walking and was "crying in pain." Furthermore, lab tests reportedly found that the child had "low platelet counts, low blood cell counts, and high liver enzymes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Wilson was not held for further observation or treatment and was instead sent home with an increased prescription for morphine and gabapentin, the family claimed. This decision was reportedly "endorsed" by Wilson's regular oncologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of admitting Ava to the hospital to get her blood pressure, heart rate and pain levels within acceptable and normal limits, Advocate employees sent Ava home," said the trial's lead attorney, Matthew L. Williams. Williams claimed that the amount of medication given to Wilson was "excessive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days after the appointment, on October 31, Wilson died in her sleep due to lethal amounts of morphine in her system, the lawsuit claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family argued in its lawsuit that the new doses, 100 mg of gabapentin three times a day and 15 mg of morphine every four hours as needed, were much more than the child's previous prescription, and her attorney noted that if "taken together, the medications can make each other stronger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital's representatives argued that Wilson's health was in-line with leukemia complications, and that the prescribed medication was "within the recommended range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A forensic neuropathologist testified during the trial that the child died due to the medication in her system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit finally concluded on June 10 when the jury agreed with the Wilson family and awarded them $20,500,000, citing "past and future loss of society and past and future grief, sorrow and mental suffering."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 12:55:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>逐步淘汰NIH对HIV临床指南的支持的管理-《华盛顿邮报》 | Administration to phase out NIH support of HIV clinical guidelines - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxPUXZkQWZMdXBVczRLX01tZkNtT3cxV25Ndml3SFFZMlJBdHRINnVFQ0pEdmJWWHljOXM1dTQzM0gxSkhLNlFtUHBTb0ozYURkM1JPZzFEWWgxOFU4bkZ3bWdTVXFsMU1VR3BpLVJSWE5wRWNNWENGUXNpNGlac24zclVFOWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QL6L626OVVASLFWUEKPA25BW7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The National Institutes of Health’s support for federal guidelines that steer the treatment of more than a million HIV patients in the United States will be phased out by next June, according to the agency’s Office of AIDS Research, a move that troubled some doctors and raised questions about whether the guidelines themselves will change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3WJBZ3AHOFAXLGWANTDJW3HICQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;It is unclear whether Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

They were burning the candle at both ends, and they were taking a lot of injectable drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJUWZTDJXBGF7ODZD4OZPACHPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Under Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/04/hiv-trump-cuts-prep/" target="_blank"&gt;HHS has terminated&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of millions of dollars in HIV-related research grants.

							&lt;p data-start="152" data-end="547"&gt;We all know someone who seems to glide through the decades with the same energy and sparkle they had at twenty‑five. They’re not blessed by genetics alone—they practise small, repeatable habits that science links with slower biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="152" data-end="547"&gt;Below are nine of the most compelling morning rituals I’ve found in the literature (and tried myself) that appear to keep Father Time on the back foot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="554" data-end="615"&gt;1. They greet the sunrise instead of the snooze button&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="616" data-end="1127"&gt;Early exposure to natural light anchors your circadian rhythm, lowers evening melatonin at the right time, and, remarkably, is associated with longer telomeres—the shoelace tips of your DNA that fray as you age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="616" data-end="1127"&gt;A Mendelian‑randomisation &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10558505/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that a “morning chronotype” correlates with reduced telomere attrition, while daily‑diary research shows that as little as 20 minutes of morning sunlight predicts better sleep that night—another youth‑preserving dividend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1131" data-end="1276"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1131" data-end="1140"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Pull back the curtains, open a window, and let dawn light hit your eyes (without sunglasses) while you breathe for five calmer minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1283" data-end="1329"&gt;2. They meditate before they caffeinate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1330" data-end="1755"&gt;Stress accelerates biological ageing; mindfulness turns down the dial. Reviews by Nobel‑Prize laureate Elizabeth Blackburn and colleagues suggest that meditation dampens stress reactivity and may preserve telomere length over time. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3057175/"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; came to similar conclusions. In plain English: ten quiet minutes on the cushion today can translate into younger cells tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1759" data-end="1892"&gt;&lt;em data-start="1759" data-end="1768"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Sit upright, count ten slow breaths, and notice the feel of the air. If your mind bolts, that’s normal—gently call it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="1899" data-end="1947"&gt;3. They move their bodies (gently counts)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1948" data-end="2449"&gt;From brisk walking to sun‑salutation yoga, morning movement supplies oxygen, stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, and is repeatedly linked to slower biological age. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10274991/"&gt;Long‑term physical‑activity studies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10572212/"&gt;large U.S. datasets&lt;/a&gt; show that regular running or jogging corresponds with longer leukocyte telomeres and lower all‑cause mortality. You don’t need to be an ultramarathoner—20‑30 minutes of moderate exertion is enough to switch on the anti‑ageing machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2453" data-end="2575"&gt;&lt;em data-start="2453" data-end="2462"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Lace up before breakfast. I run 4–5 km at conversational pace, then stretch—my mood (and skin) thank me all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="2582" data-end="2646"&gt;4. They rehydrate before anything else touches their lips&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2647" data-end="3050"&gt;Ageing cells shrink when chronically dehydrated. An &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2023/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging"&gt;NIH‑led cohort&lt;/a&gt; found that adults whose serum‑sodium levels signalled sub‑optimal hydration were up to 50 % more likely to present a “biological age” older than their actual years, and had higher premature‑mortality risk. Two tall glasses of water on rising &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/good-hydration-linked-healthy-aging?"&gt;help the brain&lt;/a&gt;, kidneys, and skin start the day fresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3054" data-end="3158"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3054" data-end="3063"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Keep a carafe on your night stand. Down 500 ml, then chase it with whatever hot brew you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="3165" data-end="3229"&gt;5. They eat an antioxidant‑rich, protein‑steady breakfast&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3711"&gt;Mountains of oxidative‑stress research point to berries, nuts, greens, and quality proteins as first‑line defenders against cellular damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3230" data-end="3711"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/13/4/394"&gt;Reviews&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em data-start="3382" data-end="3396"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/em&gt; and other journals emphasise that diets dense in polyphenols, vitamin C, and plant fats correlate with healthier ageing trajectories. Translation: swap sugary cereal for Greek yoghurt, blueberries, chia, and a handful of almonds and you’re feeding your cells’ clean‑up crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3715" data-end="3811"&gt;&lt;em data-start="3715" data-end="3724"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; I blend spinach, frozen berries, pea protein, and oat milk—five minutes, zero excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="3818" data-end="3864"&gt;6. They scribble a quick gratitude line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3865" data-end="4220"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/experiencing-gratitude-associated-with-greater-longevity-among-older-adults/"&gt;Harvard‑Chan School analysis&lt;/a&gt; of 49,000 older women found that those scoring highest on a gratitude questionnaire had a 9 % lower risk of death over four years, even after controlling for health behaviours. Gratitude lowers inflammatory markers and boosts positive affect, both known moderators of ageing pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4224" data-end="4376"&gt;&lt;em data-start="4224" data-end="4233"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Write one thing you’re thankful for on a sticky note. Stick it to the kettle. The repetition rewires the default‑mode network toward optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="4383" data-end="4419"&gt;7. They delay the doom‑scroll&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;Smartphones spike cortisol and fragment attention—two ageing accelerants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/dealing-with-smartphone-stress"&gt;Clinical commentary&lt;/a&gt; from Australia’s College of GPs links intensive phone use with higher self‑reported stress and disturbed cortisol rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4420" data-end="4810"&gt;By keeping screens off for the first 30 minutes, slow‑agers guard that fragile morning calm and let their HPA‑axis warm up naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4814" data-end="4907"&gt;&lt;em data-start="4814" data-end="4823"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Activate “do not disturb” until you’ve finished breakfast. Your inbox will survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="4914" data-end="4962"&gt;8. They apply sunscreen—yes, even indoors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5380"&gt;Photo‑ageing accounts for up to 80 % of visible facial ageing. A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/"&gt;landmark randomised trial&lt;/a&gt; proved that daily broad‑spectrum SPF 30 slowed wrinkle formation and hyper‑pigmentation in middle‑aged adults, independent of genetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4963" data-end="5380"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/sunscreen-and-your-morning-routine"&gt;Johns Hopkins dermatologists echo:&lt;/a&gt; apply after cleansing, before makeup, every single morning. Your skin will quite literally look younger for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5384" data-end="5472"&gt;&lt;em data-start="5384" data-end="5393"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Keep a pump bottle beside your toothbrush. Habit stacking beats forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 data-start="5479" data-end="5534"&gt;9. They plot one purpose‑driven goal for the day&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2740716/?"&gt;Longevity research&lt;/a&gt; shows that having a “sense of purpose” predicts lower mortality risk, even when health, wealth, and personality are controlled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;Rolling out of bed and deciding “what one thing will make today meaningful?” primes dopamine circuits and sustains motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5535" data-end="5952"&gt;Over months, that goal‑orientation supports healthier behaviours and social ties—keys to ageing slowly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5956" data-end="6064"&gt;&lt;em data-start="5956" data-end="5965"&gt;Try it:&lt;/em&gt; Write your single, soulful intention on a note card and carry it in your wallet. Re‑read at lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6071" data-end="6097"&gt;Bringing it together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6098" data-end="6380"&gt;You’ll notice none of these practices require expensive gadgets or eight‑step biohacking regimes. They’re simple, repeatable, and grounded in psychology’s favourite anti‑ageing levers: lower chronic stress, tighter circadian rhythms, stable metabolic health, and positive emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6382" data-end="6622"&gt;My challenge to you: choose &lt;strong data-start="6410" data-end="6417"&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; habit tomorrow morning and stick with it for a week. Then layer another. Ageing may be inevitable, but the &lt;em data-start="6525" data-end="6531"&gt;rate&lt;/em&gt; at which we age is negotiable—and the negotiation begins before 9 a.m. See you at sunrise.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Creatine — long beloved by gym rats who mix it into protein shakes — is shaping up to be much more than a muscle building and fat loss supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mounting research suggests it may also boost &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cardiologist-shares-easy-way-avoid-biggest-calorie-heart-health-mistake-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;, protect against &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facing-early-onset-alzheimers-how-family-copes-with-genetic-fate-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;, improve mood, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/calcium-rich-dairy-free-foods-to-build-strong-bones-2019-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strengthen your bones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While researchers typically have a healthy &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/supplements-myths-us-top-supplement-expert-2024-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mistrust of supplements&lt;/a&gt;, creatine is the rare exception, recommended even among skeptical scientists and doctors: it's reliably safe, relatively inexpensive, and backed by extensive, high-quality studies. And it costs, on average, less than 50 cents per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if there's anything on the planet that comes close to creatine from a multifactorial approach," Darren Candow, a top creatine researcher and professor of exercise physiology, nutrition and aging at Regina University in Canada, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, interest in creatine has skyrocketed, in tandem with research showing it can double up as a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/a-longevity-doctor-takes-these-3-supplements-daily-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;longevity supplement&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearly a century later, scientists started to figure out how it's stored and used for energy in the human body. They experimented with extracting creatine from meat and later synthesizing it in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't until the Barcelona &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-surprises-attending-paris-olympics-regular-person-2024-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Olympic Games&lt;/a&gt; in 1992 that creatine went mainstream. The British gold-medal sprinters, sharing how they got in shape, gushed about the powerful effects of a little-known supplement: creatine. In 1993, the first commercial creatine hit store shelves, and sales boomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how does it work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a raw material for producing ATP, a molecule that gives our cells energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of creatine is stored in the muscles, where it offers a ready fuel source for high-intensity effort. More creatine can improve strength and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/muscle-building-potential-gains-progress-monthly-trainer-2022-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;muscle gains&lt;/a&gt; by providing a bit more energy, helping you push a little bit harder and work out for longer before getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies naturally produce creatine through a combination of amino acids. That's only a small amount, though. We can get more of it from some foods like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/red-meat" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;red meat&lt;/a&gt; and fish — or, through supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past five years, demand for creatine as a fitness aid has spiked, with retail prices up 150% and sales increased by 90% year over year, despite steadily rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it's not just for muscle-hungry gym bros.&lt;/p&gt;

                      Creatine gives your cells more energy, helping you to push a little harder in the gym before you get tired.

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While men continue to make up the majority of creatine users, about 21% of the creatine buyers are women, according to data from nationwide supplement retailers The Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At SuppCo, both Glen, the CSO, and Steve Martocci, the CEO, said their wives have recently started taking creatine — reflecting a broader trend of women as a growing consumer base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What changed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martocci pointed to more evidence dispelling the myth that creatine is just for muscle men to bulk up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/16/3567" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;early research&lt;/a&gt; suggests creatine can support hormonal health for women, helping to counteract shifts that can occur during the menstrual cycle by helping to maintain levels of glycogen in the muscle for better energy and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="f485d814-927b-420c-83c8-ed0f2b157411" data-toc-id="f485d814-927b-420c-83c8-ed0f2b157411"&gt;Creatine slows aging and boosts brain health, per new research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, a small study found that patients with Alzheimer's disease saw a boost to their &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/brain-ages-more-57-70-78-protein-exercise-sleep-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; after supplementing creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think that just providing more energy to the brain could be useful," Scott Forbes, a sports science researcher and professor at Brandon University who was not involved in the study, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The brain actually uses about 20% of your total energy expenditure, even though it only weighs about 2% of your body weight. So for a tissue, it's very energetically demanding," Forbes said.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Creatine also seems to have an anti-inflammatory effect, making the brain more resilient against stresses that would wear down its ability to perform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that too much inflammation or too much oxidative stress can also lead to poor cognition or poor brain functions," Forbes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other recent studies have found that supplementing creatine could also help to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-age-you-faster-make-you-look-older-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;mitigate the effects of aging&lt;/a&gt; or a concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The theory is that the brain can remodel itself or at least maintain its function during times of stress," Candow, the aging researcher at Regina University, told Business Insider. "I don't know anybody in the world that's not stressed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research is expanding creatine's reach to consumers beyond the gym, according to Muriel Gonzalez, president of nationwide supplement retailer The Vitamin Shoppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Creatine is undergoing a major transformation — from a niche sports nutrition supplement to a versatile tool for daily health and longevity," Gonzalez told Business Insider over email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total creatine sales have spiked by 300% from 2019 to 2024 at The Vitamin Shoppe, and are continuing to grow at a double-digit pace, according to company data.&lt;/p&gt;

                      Should you buy creatine? It could offer a boost for your muscles and brain — but make sure you have a good diet and stay active.

            &lt;p&gt;You'll be disappointed if you expect to transform your life, and health, with a few doses of creatine. A supplement can provide a boost but ultimately makes a relatively small difference. Your overall diet, exercise, and lifestyle are far more important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the bottom line is that more and more research supports taking creatine for a huge range of benefits, with very little downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think almost everybody should consider taking creatine," Forbes, the science researcher at Brandon University, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in high doses over a long time period, side effects are mild, such as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/conditions-symptoms/stomach-ache" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gastrointestinal upset&lt;/a&gt; and a slight increase in water retention, since creatine pulls water into the muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall it's one of the safest supplements out there," Eric Gonzalez, a neuroscience professor at Texas Christian University who has studied creatine, told Business Insider. "If anyone wants to go on a supplement, creatine won't hurt you, there's only going to be an upside."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're losing weight — including those on a GLP-1 drug that triggers weight loss — creatine can help you retain muscle mass, promoting a higher ratio of muscle to body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-ways-to-improve-your-mood-according-to-psychologists" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;boost brain health or mood&lt;/a&gt;, early studies suggest that 10-30 grams a day may be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glen previously conducted research on senior Olympians who took creatine and found it helped them get stronger and faster while avoiding age-related decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're never too old to take creatine," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Despite the profound human, social and economic costs of alcohol abuse, existing treatments have failed to provide meaningful relief. Excessive alcohol consumption remains a leading cause of &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240096745"&gt;death and disability worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. In the U.S. alone, &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health/national-releases/2023"&gt;16.4 million people&lt;/a&gt; age 12 and older reported binge drinking on five or more days in the past month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are several drugs available to those seeking to stop or lower their alcohol consumption, their &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2015.1133472"&gt;effectiveness is limited&lt;/a&gt;, and they often have significant side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three decades, efforts to treat excessive drinking have focused primarily on developing drugs that target proteins that can control how neurons respond to stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because these proteins are present in almost every neuron throughout the brain, the drugs also affect neurons that aren't directly responsible for regulating alcohol's effects. This often leads to unwanted side effects like headache, fatigue, drowsiness or insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my work &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gilles-Martin-3"&gt;as a neurobiologist&lt;/a&gt;, I study the idea that pinpointing the specific brain circuits that play a role in suppressing alcohol consumption is critical to developing targeted treatments with limited side effects. In my newly published research, my team and I identified a small cluster of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;neurons responsible for suppressing binge drinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A map of binge drinking neurons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.mp.4000206"&gt;identified several brain regions&lt;/a&gt; that play a key role in alcohol abuse. But there has been strong evidence that only a very small number of neurons within these regions underpinned the effects of the drug on brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small populations of neurons, called &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/memories-of-the-good-parts-of-using-drugs-can-keep-people-hooked-altering-the-neurons-that-store-them-could-help-treat-addiction-245529"&gt;neuronal ensembles&lt;/a&gt;, have been shown to play a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2015.07.009"&gt;key role&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11028"&gt;memory formation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35379803"&gt;experiencing fear&lt;/a&gt;. However, researchers haven't known whether the neuronal ensembles activated during binge drinking also influence binge drinking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000437413"&gt;billions of neurons&lt;/a&gt; contained in the brain, the task of identifying these neurons is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. To solve this challenge, my colleagues and I used a genetically modified mouse model that, upon exposure to alcohol, activates a gene coding for a red fluorescent protein that is selectively expressed in alcohol-sensitive neurons. By tracing these fluorescent neurons, we were able to make a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;map of the precise locations of affected neurons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified a discrete number of neurons that respond to binge drinking in a brain region called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2018.01.010"&gt;medial orbitofrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;. This area is known for its key role in controlling decision-making and adapting behavior to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found that turning this neuronal ensemble off resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-01970-x"&gt;sharp increase of alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This means that the brain has, in essence, a built-in regulation system that is activated during alcohol drinking to act as a brake on its consumption. Should these neurons misfire, the regulatory system would fail, possibly leading to uncontrolled drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this study advances our understanding of how and where binge drinking modulates brain function in mice, it remains unclear whether human brains are also equipped with the same neuronal ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they are, stimulating these neurons may provide a path toward helping people who experience difficulty controlling their alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although selective control of neuronal activity is a formidable challenge, &lt;a href="https://www.umassmed.edu/news/news-archives/2016/04/newsweek-umass-medical-school-develops-gene-therapy-for-rare-neurodegenerative-disease/"&gt;progress in gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; for patients with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="165378" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and other rare diseases offers hope for more effective alcohol use disorder treatments with fewer side effects.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257217/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Millions of Americans have high cholesterol, which can lead to heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bedtime snack rich in fiber and plant protein may help lower cholesterol. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For a cholesterol-lowering late-night snack, our Chia Seed Pudding checks all the boxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high cholesterol, you’re not alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, millions of Americans have high cholesterol (aka hyperlipidemia).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This condition, defined as total blood &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, is a leading risk factor for heart disease. However, that doesn’t mean you’re destined for heart troubles. “Keeping cholesterol levels in a healthy range helps reduce the risk of plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease over time,” says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/registered-dietitians#kathleen-benson" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kathleen Benson, RDN, CSSD, CPT&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, healthy meals are the foundation of a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol-lowering diet&lt;/a&gt;. But snacks can help, too—even the ones you eat before bed, like our ​​&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt;. It’s loaded with ingredients that can help reduce cholesterol. Yet, it’s light and satisfying enough that it won’t mess with your sleep. No wonder dietitians are huge fans. Here’s how it can help keep your heart healthy.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the myriad benefits of enjoying a high-fiber diet is that it can help lower cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When I have a client trying to manage high cholesterol levels, we focus on getting more fiber and healthier fats in their diet,” says &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meggie Connelly, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Filled with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fiber-rich chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, our Chia Seed Pudding delivers a hefty 11 grams of fiber per serving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain a mix of both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble and insoluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But it’s their soluble fiber that’s behind chia’s cholesterol-lowering powers. The reason? Soluble fiber can absorb some of the cholesterol in your gut, removing it from the body before it can cause trouble. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, research has shown that cholesterol from food doesn’t always affect your blood cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The real culprit is saturated fat, found mainly in full-fat dairy, red and processed meat, lard and ghee. Saturated fat tells your liver to rev up its cholesterol production, which provides far more cholesterol than the amount we absorb from food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since this chia pudding is made with almond milk, it contains merely 1 gram of saturated fat per serving. If almond milk isn’t your thing, feel free to sub in another &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dietitians-favorite-plant-based-milk-11733338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based milk&lt;/a&gt; like soy, cashew or oat milk or low-fat cow’s milk. Just steer clear of coconut milk and full-fat cow’s milk, which are both high in saturated fat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have high cholesterol or not, choosing a late-night snack that contains some protein is the key to staying satiated all night long. “This will help you feel full during the night and help control blood sugar levels so you’re not starving by the morning,” says&lt;a href="https://www.brannoninbalancenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Brannon Blount, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Each serving of this chia pudding delivers 7 grams of protein. And not just any kind of protein. All of its protein is plant protein, which has been linked to better heart health. It’s so beneficial that the American Heart Association recommends getting most of our protein from plant sources like the chia seeds and nuts in this recipe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-heart-healthy-bedtime-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Heart-Healthy Bedtime Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A combination of fiber and protein.&lt;/strong&gt; Consider this the magic duo. “Fiber and protein combined, or paired together with an assortment of foods, can support steady blood sugar and satiety,” Benson says. That’s important because chronically high blood sugar levels can lead to diabetes, which increases heart disease risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients that are easy to digest.&lt;/strong&gt; When you’re trying to get some quality zzz’s, the last thing you need to eat is something that will upset your tummy or delay sleep even further. Choose something light, easy to digest and satisfying, yet low in fat and added sugars. In addition to chia pudding, oatmeal, popcorn and cereal with low-fat milk are all great options.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something simple to assemble. &lt;/strong&gt;After a long day, it’s normal to experience some decision fatigue. But, instead of reaching for something with empty calories (we’re looking at you, bag of chips), choose something nutrient-dense that you can easily whip up. “Your late-night snack needs to be quick and easy to put together, like a banana and nut butter, or a peanut butter and sliced strawberry sandwich on whole-grain bread. Or make your chia pudding in advance,” says Connelly. “If you have to spend 30 minutes making your late-night snack, it’s not going to be something you do consistently.”&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacking may get a bad rap, but if you didn’t eat enough during the day, a little nibble before bed might help you fall and stay asleep. That said, if you have high cholesterol, there are some considerations to keep in mind. If cholesterol is an issue, dietitians recommend choosing a snack that’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/heart-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8700225" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in fiber, low in saturated fat&lt;/a&gt; and contains some protein.

So, whip some up today. You can double (or even quadruple) the recipe. And it will stay fresh in your fridge for up to three days for a hassle-free bedtime snack your heart will thank you for. &lt;br&gt;

Sometimes these mood swings can and should be examined as cause for concern, but a few TikTok creators explained how it's also good to take a step back and analyze our feelings before jumping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00" rel="nofollow"&gt;TikTok content creator Anania&lt;/a&gt; told their followers that after eating, all of the depressive thoughts they were having before had simply gone away. Many people were quick to agree, while other content creators were able to put a name to that phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There are four things we should ask ourselves using the HALT technique before beginning to spiral:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let's consider, though, I'm not a [expletive] and I'm just hungry at this moment, you know what I mean?" &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anania00/video/7248847178918169902" rel="nofollow"&gt;Anania began in their video&lt;/a&gt;. "Then we might be able to start our healing journey as a unit because I haven't thought about suicide in the past 20 minutes, and I just had a 3-piece from Popeye's. There's a correlation here, is all I'm saying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Anania's initial video was meant to be humorous, it sparked a conversation about how many of our negative emotions are often tied to simple issues that can be solved — i.e., eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling.png" alt="woman using the HALT technique to determine she's hungry and not spiraling" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Photology1971 | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/stop-obsessive-negative-thoughts-become-positive-person"&gt;5 Simple Ways To Combat Obsessive Negative Thoughts — And Become A More Positive Person&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Am I hungry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zairell777/video/7250268182869478699" rel="nofollow"&gt;video stitching Anania's original clip&lt;/a&gt;, another content creator, @zairell777, pointed out that there is a way we can look within ourselves to stop our emotions from spiraling. "This person is spot [expletive] on," she said of Anania's revelation that they felt better after having a meal. She explained that it's part of a DBT skill that she had learned and was called HALT, an acronym for Hunger, Anger, Lonely, and Tired.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're feeling anything negative, if you feel any negative emotions [or] you're having some negative thought patterns, run down the list and then act accordingly," she continued. "Were you suicidal or did you just need some chicken?" She acknowledged that while that's not the case all the time, for many occurrences, being in a negative headspace can easily be solved by eating. The phenomenon, also called being "hangry," isn't an irrational feeling to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" rel="nofollow"&gt;findings published in the peer-reviewed journal &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269629" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;, data showed that hunger was associated with 37% of changes in irritability, 34% in anger, and 38% in pleasure, suggesting that these emotions were caused by fluctuations in hunger. Researchers have even found that low blood glucose levels can trigger irritability, causing people to have a shorter fuse than usual when hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Am I angry?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger isn't exactly a pleasant emotional state, but it is completely normal, and it's important to acknowledge that. Psychiatrist and addiction specialist David Streem, MD, is a proponent of using the HALT method and he explained, “Just because you feel angry doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you,” he told the &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/halt-hungry-angry-lonely-tired" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. “But chronic, persistent anger is unhealthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to make that distinction. He went on to say, “Focus on who’s in the driver’s seat. When I’m upset and it’s time to move on to my next activity — to go home, to go to work — I should be able to turn that off and let it go in a real way, not just packing it down. That way, in my next activity, I can be present when I’m with my family or working with co-workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/reason-you-cant-get-past-anger"&gt;turn that anger off&lt;/a&gt;, and essentially move on, as Dr. Streem described, then you have a good grasp on your emotions and don't have cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-carrying-more-anger-realize"&gt;5 Signs You Might Be Carrying More Anger Than You Realize, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Am I lonely?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and feeling isolated can open the door to intrusive thoughts, which is why experts agree it's important, when you're feeling vulnerable, to determine if what you really need is human connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://cl.kp.org/natl/home/refcontainerpage.dam.nohf.public.html?damrefpath=/content/dam/clinicallibrary/scal/mem_ed/healthed/nutrition_month/chl035e-8.pdf&amp;amp;accessvia=scal_chl" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kaiser Permanente&lt;/a&gt; shared, once you have isolated loneliness as the cause for your negative emotions, you can take action by reaching out to loved ones. Additionally, you can make a plan to increase your community by joining local clubs or even trying out a new hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-06/things-ask-ourselves-using-halt-before-spiraling-am-i-lonely.png" alt="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using HALT Technique Before Spiraling, Am I Lonely" title="4 Things To Ask Yourself Using The HALT Technique Before Spiraling" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Dmytro Sheremeta | Shutterstock &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle/video/7213437985717620014" rel="nofollow"&gt;In another video,&lt;/a&gt; TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lacyhartselle" rel="nofollow"&gt;creator Lacy&lt;/a&gt; expanded on how we can use HALT to check in with ourselves if we feel our emotions spiraling. "This is a good way to assess yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed or vulnerable and your thoughts are starting to spiral," Lacy said of the acronym. "Do I need to express some feelings here? Am I lonely? Do I need to phone a friend or at least journal to myself?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacy explained that HALT can help us catch ourselves before we turn our negative emotions and thoughts onto another person. "Am I Hungry? Am I Angry? Am I Lonely? Am I Tired? Do I need to address these things?" She added, "After you take action to meet your own needs and to check in with yourself, you can function from a more clear-headed and balanced space." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Am I tired?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like hunger, being tired is a physical state that can impact our emotions. As Dr. Streem stated, “Fatigue is like being hungry — it’s a condition that affects the brain.” It's as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/habit-well-rested-people-use-fall-asleep-quickly"&gt;aren't getting enough sleep&lt;/a&gt; or you've even just had one bad bout of tossing and turning, acknowledging it allows you to make a simple action plan to help yourself. You can commit to a new sleep routine, cut out caffeine after noon, set a reasonable bedtime, or even indulge in some nice new bedding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In the comments section, many people agreed with being able to use 'HALT' to assess their emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For about a week, I was tracking my mood as part of a challenge from another app. Realized I started spiraling around 2:30 most days. Just needed food," one TikTok user pointed out. Another user added, "This has been such a powerful tool during my &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-therapist-recommends-start-feel-depressed"&gt;healing from depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t disregard this, people, it’s so true!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’ve told a lot of people since my therapist told me about this, too. It’s really helpful because a lot of us don’t know when we’re hungry or tired," a third user chimed in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to practice self-awareness, stress management techniques, and finding healthy ways to cope with negative emotions can be extremely beneficial for our overall well-being and emotional care. As Dr. Streem wisely noted, “HALT is a wonderful reminder of the simplest things we often forget to do to take care of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you or someone you know is in emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;suicidepreventionlifeline.org&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to connect to a trained crisis counselor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/emotionally-grounding-steps-solve-problem-life"&gt;The 5 Emotionally Grounding Steps That Can Help You Solve Any Problem In Life &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nia Tipton is a Chicago-based entertainment, news, and lifestyle writer whose work delves into modern-day issues and experiences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="field field--name-field-content-contains-affiliate field--type-boolean field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jun 2025 01:20:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxPRGJrQ3dmeF9WdldDSzRENzF5MlpGZnFLV2tsMFlXU3ZNMlpUMVBKMXBTYkNiemN4NUxDRjRHa1VvSDRUaFMxTUNKU2c5SmhFZzFrQ2dTYk8wLXpRQUNTNk5QdTJrZ1VSc29VSERGTVp3eTlOekpzVkF4RHpMRS1lTlFMMzF4U2NJd0FvM0NpM25sdw</guid></item><item><title>爱荷华州宣布麻疹爆发，美国超过1,200例确诊病例- PBS | Iowa announces measles outbreak as U.S. tops 1,200 confirmed cases - PBS</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPVjNvdmNKa2ZBazB3d0RLRkt5bmZIeGJfNklVeHhwVGdOM25BUmlIc2t1OEtia21Ob3lPOVAwczFWeDBKTC00LVZoMXp2T052RXc3Z05LbGtqNUhQOGt4Y1ZIRWZRUzZnQVRIWnlJc3dfTEJuN2FoOU9rUHdyZ04zV3Vsc1NKeFozYXQ4SXRPOEhlemFqemFNTUt3aGZDa0lHNHfSAacBQVVfeXFMTmNRcWN5T2Jydl9SR0h0UGlqWEIyN0VfcEhzclo3bGtIWVdSaU9YTjF6NjF4Nk5xYWtTT2ltMWR4b0NPQTFpV1VSMTRJejBLSS1PeDdXckY2cHBkdzVUSGFrNFlvaTlXMld6WTdXU1hlQU1BejQ1RldjMWllSnFOSjYtZTRYSTVJci1MZHFuWnV1UjZKS3pOaWFXOUswNDhJM2M1T0FFMzQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The U.S. logged fewer than 20 measles cases this week, though Iowa announced the state’s first outbreak Thursday and Georgia confirmed its second Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 1,214 confirmed measles cases this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health officials in Texas, where the nation’s biggest outbreak raged during the late winter and spring, confirmed six cases in the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three other major outbreaks in North America. The longest, in Ontario, Canada, has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/Documents/M/24/measles-ontario-epi-summary.pdf?rev=3d8451977cd34084a8b494a6a11b4f1a&amp;amp;sc_lang=en&amp;amp;hash=48D1A6D0D037B39BD421AAF060204EE0"&gt;2,179 cases&lt;/a&gt; from mid-October through June 17. The province logged its first death June 5 in a baby who got congenital measles but also had other preexisting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/diseases-know-no-borders-measles-spreads-with-outbreaks-in-canada-mexico-and-u-s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; ‘Diseases know no borders’: Measles spreads with outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another outbreak in Alberta, Canada, has sickened &lt;a href="https://www.alberta.ca/measles"&gt;996 as of Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. And the Mexican state of Chihuahua had 2,335 measles cases and four deaths as of Friday, according to data from the state health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other U.S. states with active outbreaks — which the CDC defines as three or more related cases — include Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., two elementary school-aged children in the epicenter in West Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died of measles this year. All were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in Texas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a total of 750 cases across &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7"&gt;35 counties, most of them in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;, state health officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the outbreak, 97 people have been hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;State health officials estimated&lt;/a&gt; less than 1% of cases — fewer than 10 — are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 413 cases since late January — just under 2% of its residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many measles cases are there in New Mexico?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state’s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Doña Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated adult died of measles-related illness March 6. The person did not seek medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma added one case Friday for a total of 17 confirmed and three probable cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department is not releasing which counties have cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Arizona?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona has four cases in Navajo County. They are linked to a single source, the county health department said June 9. All four were unvaccinated and had a history of recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Colorado?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colorado has seen a total of 16 measles cases in 2025, which includes one outbreak of 10 related cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is linked to a Turkish Airlines flight that landed at Denver International Airport in mid-May. Four of the people were on the flight with the first case — an out-of-state traveler not included in the state count — while five got measles from exposure in the airport and one elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are also tracking an unrelated case in a Boulder County resident. The person was fully vaccinated but had “recently traveled to Europe, where there are a large number of measles cases,” the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other counties that have seen measles this year include Archuleta and Pueblo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Georgia?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia has an outbreak of three cases in metro Atlanta, with the most recent infection confirmed Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has confirmed six total cases in 2025. The remaining three are part of an unrelated outbreak from January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Illinois?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following weeks, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state’s other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Iowa?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iowa has had six total measles cases in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four are part of an outbreak in eastern Johnson County, among members of the same household. County health officials said the people are isolating at home, so they don’t expect additional spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; has a total of 79 cases across 11 counties in the southwestern part of the state, with three hospitalizations. All but three of the cases are connected, and most are in Gray County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in Montana?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montana had 22 measles cases as of Friday. Fourteen were in Gallatin County, which is where the first cases showed up — Montana’s first in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flathead and Yellowstone counties had two cases each, and Hill County had four cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are outbreaks in neighboring North Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How many cases are there in North Dakota?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Dakota, which hadn’t seen measles since 2011, was up to 34 cases as of June 6, but has held steady since. Two of the people have been hospitalized. All of the people with confirmed cases were not vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 16 cases in Williams County in western North Dakota on the Montana border. On the eastern side of the state, there were 10 cases in Grand Forks County and seven cases in Cass County. Burke County, in northwest North Dakota on the border of Saskatchewan, Canada, had one case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported this year in Alaska, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials declared earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania over after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee’s outbreak also appears to be over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year. Most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What do you need to know about the MMR vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation that they had measles are immune and those born before 1957 generally don’t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have “presumptive immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — due to “herd immunity.” But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="mb-0 pb-2 ap-font-bold"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A dog in Raleigh is recovering after being bitten by a rabid
raccoon on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Animal Control was called to Windsor Trail in Raleigh on Thursday
after the dog had been bitten. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Wake County Public Health and Wake County Animal Control
confirmed on Friday the raccoon tested positive for rabies. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to county officials, the dog was up to date on its
rabies vaccination and received a booster after being bitten. It is expected to
be ok. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Rabies is a serious public health concern, and we’re
grateful that this pet was protected through vaccination,” said Wake County
Commissioner Tara Waters. “This incident is an important reminder of why it’s
so critical to keep your pets up to date on their rabies shots.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Anyone in the area who may have encountered a raccoon is asked to call the Wake County Communicable Disease line at 919-250-4462. If a person or their
pet may have been bitten or scratched, officials advise seeking medical
attention right away. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;County officials have provided a list of tips to help
minimize rabies risks:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/rabid-raccoon-bites-dog-raleigh-june-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/local/rabid-raccoon-bites-dog-raleigh-june-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not approach animals that you do not know. Exercise caution and maintain a safe distance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have been bitten or scratched by an animal of unknown vaccination history, wash the wound immediately and seek medical attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure your pets have a current rabies vaccination. If your pet is allowed outside, a booster vaccine is strongly recommended. Keep outdoor pets indoors until they receive the booster vaccines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not feed stray or unknown animals, including cats and dogs. Avoid any interaction that may result in potential exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not leave trash or food outside unless it is in a trash can with a tight-fitting lid. Prevent attracting wild animals to your property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet is fed outside, do not leave food out overnight to minimize the chances of attracting animals that may carry rabies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a pet comes in contact with an animal that might be rabid, contact a veterinarian immediately. Seek professional guidance to ensure the well-being of your pet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of emergency room visits for Covid-19 in Vermont hit zero multiple times over the past week, “at or nearing” a historic low for that indicator, the Department of Health reported Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health department first reported a drop in Covid-19 hospital visits in its &lt;a href="https://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/document/COVID-19-Surveillance-report-20250618_0.pdf"&gt;weekly surveillance report&lt;/a&gt;. Epidemiologist John Davy confirmed via email there have been a few recent days with no emergency room visits, with the rolling average around one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wrote that overall hospitalizations for the disease, which includes Vermonters who have been in the hospital with Covid-19 for days or weeks, have not dropped to zero. But the number of current patients has been in the “low single digits” in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In past years, the period of late spring and early summer has been marked by low rates, followed by a rise in the late summer into early fall. Davy wrote it “remains to be seen” if that pattern will reappear in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There have been recent outbreaks in Long-Term Care facilities, so there is clearly some amount of COVID circulating,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state health department also reported it has detected the presence of a new Covid-19 variant, NB.1.8.1. The variant has made international headlines for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid19-sore-throat-razor-blade-vaccine-4688df53917022cb61204e08b41d5952"&gt;causing severe sore throats&lt;/a&gt; nicknamed “razor blade throats.” But it has not been found in Vermont in large numbers, Davy wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There is no clear indication that NB.1.8.1 is associated with greater disease severity,” he wrote. “Preliminary lab studies suggest that vaccines will be effective against severe outcomes from this strain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of vaccines themselves are still uncertain, however. Covid-19 vaccines tailored to the dominant strains of the virus have typically become available in early fall, along with other seasonal vaccines like influenza. But U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a long history of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-vaccine-trump-science-autism-9b99621b01f11b7f0bdc81e5a0b82d2b"&gt;anti-vaccine activism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kennedy recently dropped the recommendation for &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-you-still-get-a-covid-vaccine-this-fall-heres-what-to-know/"&gt;pregnant people and healthy children to receive the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;dismissed all 17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory panel, replacing them with eight of his own appointees, some of whom have previously objected to the Covid-19 shots.

By analyzing facial features during a foraging task in a virtual reality setup, researchers identified patterns linked to motivation, focus, and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These patterns were consistent across species, suggesting a shared link between facial expression and cognition. If similar findings hold in humans, this method could revolutionize diagnostics in ADHD, autism, and dementia by objectively measuring attention and other mental states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Species Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Facial expressions reflect similar internal cognitive states in both mice and macaques.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Specific facial patterns can forecast how quickly and accurately animals complete tasks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to new diagnostic tools for non-verbal conditions like autism, ADHD, or dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether you are solving a puzzle, navigating a shopping center or writing an email: How well you do will not only depend on the task at hand but also on your internal cognitive state.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Motivated, focused, restless, confident, or insecure?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, researchers at the Ernst Strüngmann Institute in Frankfurt have now shown that such cognitive states can be identified from facial expressions — and can even be used to accurately predict how quickly and successfully a task will be solved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111079"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg" alt="This shows a woman pulling different facial expressions." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/facial-expressions-cognition-neurosicenc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study thus also shows how facial expressions can be used as objective measures of internal states, allowing conclusions to be drawn about thought processes. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, this works across species – more specifically, macaques and mice. In both species, facial expressions not only express emotional states, but also latent cognitive processes in a measurable way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cognitive states are similar across species&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal behaviour, for example when searching for food, is largely influenced by internal cognitive states such as attention or motivation to find food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was therefore to better describe functional aspects of cognitive processes and to analyze whether latent cognitive states are similar across species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this end, the researchers had macaques and mice perform a naturalistic foraging task in a specially developed virtual reality environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide range of facial expressions were recorded, which were then used in a statistical model and further computer simulations to identify a series of latent states that accurately predict when the animals will respond to the stimuli shown and how well they will solve the search task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between the identified states and task performance is comparable between species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each cognitive state corresponds to a characteristic pattern of facial features that also overlaps between species,” said postdoctoral researcher Alejandro Tlaie Boria, first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”This means that facial expressions can be considered a reliable manifestation of internal cognitive states even across species boundaries.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Facial expressions provide insight into thought processes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study thus also shows how facial expressions can be used as objective measures of internal states, allowing conclusions to be drawn about thought processes. This is already directly relevant for research on animal models and could represent a breakthrough for comparative neuroscience and behavioral research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Chances for ADHD, autism, and dementia research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the results can be transferred to human facial expressions remains to be investigated. However, if they are confirmed for humans, the findings could become relevant for applications in psychiatry and in autism and dementia research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approaches could be used to recognize latent cognitive states in non-verbal individuals, such as in cases of autism or locked-in syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective measurement of attention states also offers significant potential for improvement in ADHD diagnostics, for example to quantify severity or to identify specific cognitive patterns that can be assigned to ADHD subtypes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this facial expression and cognitive state research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Andrea Knierriem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Max Planck Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Andrea Knierriem – Max Planck Society&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60296-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Inferring internal states across mice and monkeys using facial features&lt;/a&gt;” by Alejandro Tlaie Boria et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inferring internal states across mice and monkeys using facial features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal behaviour is shaped to a large degree by internal cognitive states, but it is unknown whether these states are similar across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this question, here we develop a virtual reality setup in which male mice and macaques engage in the same naturalistic visual foraging task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We exploit the richness of a wide range of facial features extracted from video recordings during the task, to train a Markov-Switching Linear Regression (MSLR).

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise releases a protein called CLCF1 that acts like an anti-aging molecule for muscles and bones&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age, but resistance training and high-intensity exercise can restore them&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When scientists blocked this protein in mice, exercise lost most of its muscle and bone strengthening benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DAEJEON, South Korea —&lt;/strong&gt; There may really be no better “fountain of youth” remedy than a good old-fashioned workout. Research out of South Korea reveals that when you exercise, your muscles release a powerful protein that acts like a biological time machine, potentially reversing age-related decline in both muscle and bone strength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have identified that the molecule &lt;em&gt;cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1&lt;/em&gt; (CLCF1) surges through the bloodstream during workouts, particularly resistance training. This protein appears to reverse some aspects of age-related decline. The discovery could explain why some 80-year-olds can outperform sedentary 40-year-olds, and it might lead to new treatments for age-related &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/muscle-loss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle loss&lt;/a&gt; and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59959-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows that CLCF1 levels naturally decline as we age, but exercise can restore them to youthful levels. When researchers gave this protein to elderly mice, the animals regained muscle strength and bone density that rivaled much younger mice. Even more striking: when scientists blocked the protein’s activity, exercise lost most of its &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-aging benefits.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-your-muscles-talk-to-your-bones-during-exercise"&gt;How Your Muscles Talk to Your Bones During Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 belongs to a family of proteins called &lt;em&gt;myokines&lt;/em&gt;, which are chemical messengers that muscles release during physical activity. Myokines act like your muscle’s way of sending text messages to the rest of your body about what’s happening during exercise. Some messages tell fat cells to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/morning-exercise-burning-calories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burn more energy&lt;/a&gt;, others instruct bones to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/lifting-weights-vegans-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;get stronger&lt;/a&gt;, and some even reach your brain to improve mood and memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 appears especially important because it targets both muscle and bone simultaneously. As we age, both tissues typically weaken together, a process that can lead to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/frailty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, falls, and fractures. One molecule addressing both problems makes it particularly intriguing from a treatment standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by scientists in South Korea, first discovered CLCF1’s importance by analyzing gene activity in muscle samples from people of different ages before and after exercise training. They found that while young people naturally produced plenty of CLCF1 during workouts, older adults made much less of it. Declining CLCF1 levels might be a key reason why exercise becomes less effective at maintaining muscle and bone health as we age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/picture&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-laboratory-studies-show-dramatic-results"&gt;Laboratory Studies Show Dramatic Results&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test their theory, researchers conducted experiments with both cells in laboratory dishes and live mice. They treated muscle cells with CLCF1 and found that the protein supercharged the cells’ energy production, particularly their ability to burn glucose for fuel. Aging muscles often struggle to efficiently use energy, contributing to weakness and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team gave CLCF1 injections to 20-month-old mice (roughly equivalent to 80-year-old humans), the results were dramatic. After just two weeks of treatment, the elderly mice showed significant improvements in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/grip-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/2d4d-ring-finger-length-endurance-running/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;running endurance&lt;/a&gt;. Their muscle fibers grew larger, and their bones became denser and stronger.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Muscle analysis revealed that CLCF1 activated several important cellular pathways involved in muscle growth and energy production. The protein particularly boosted glycolysis, which is the process cells use to quickly generate energy from sugar. This helps explain why CLCF1 might be especially important during high-intensity exercise, when muscles need rapid bursts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 also proved to be a powerful &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/prunes-keeps-bone-disease-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bone medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The protein worked by suppressing osteoclasts (cells that break down old bone tissue) while promoting osteoblasts, the cells that build new bone. This dual action led to increased bone volume and thickness in the treated mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-engineered-mice-reveal-exercise-s-secret"&gt;Engineered Mice Reveal Exercise’s Secret&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, researchers created mice that overproduced CLCF1 throughout their lives. These mice showed enhanced muscle function and stronger bones even without extra exercise. They had better grip strength, could hang from grids longer, and ran farther on treadmills compared to normal mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers also conducted the opposite experiment: they blocked CLCF1 activity in mice during exercise training. When they gave mice a protein called &lt;em&gt;eCNTFR&lt;/em&gt; that neutralizes CLCF1, exercise lost most of its beneficial effects on both muscle and bone. The mice could still run on treadmills, but they didn’t gain the usual improvements in strength, endurance, or bone density.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simply put, CLCF1 is actually doing much of the heavy lifting when it comes to exercise’s anti-aging benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-evidence-points-to-similar-effects"&gt;Human Evidence Points to Similar Effects&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mouse studies were impressive, but do these results apply to humans? The researchers examined blood samples from people of various ages and exercise habits to find out. They discovered that circulating CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age in humans, just as they do in mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, exercise could reverse this decline. When young adults performed resistance training or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/hiit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-intensity interval workouts&lt;/a&gt;, their blood CLCF1 levels increased significantly. Older adults who participated in 12-16 week resistance training programs also saw their CLCF1 levels rise, though the response was somewhat reduced compared to younger people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different types of exercise produced different responses. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/resistance-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Resistance training&lt;/a&gt; and high-intensity intervals boosted CLCF1 levels, but moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like casual treadmill walking) did not. CLCF1 release might require a certain threshold of exercise intensity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these results are exciting, several important limitations should be noted. The human studies involved relatively small groups of participants, and the researchers acknowledge that their human data should be considered “exploratory” and require further investigation. Most of the dramatic &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anti-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anti-aging effects&lt;/a&gt; were demonstrated in mice, not humans. While mice are excellent models for studying basic biological processes, findings don’t always translate perfectly to humans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we’re still years away from CLCF1-based therapies, these results reinforce the profound importance of staying physically active throughout life. They suggest that resistance training and high-intensity exercise might be particularly powerful tools &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. For now, the best way to boost your CLCF1 levels is the old-fashioned way: hit the weights, push your limits, and let your muscles work their molecular magic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed gene expression data from human muscle samples before and after exercise to identify age-related changes in myokine production. They then conducted laboratory experiments with mouse muscle cells and performed multiple studies with young (3-month-old) and aged (18-24-month-old) mice. Some mice received CLCF1 injections, others had the protein’s activity blocked, and some were genetically modified to overproduce CLCF1. The team measured muscle strength through grip tests and treadmill running, analyzed muscle fiber size through microscopic examination, and assessed bone density using micro-CT scanning. They also collected blood samples from human participants of various ages before and after different exercise programs to measure circulating CLCF1 levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CLCF1 levels naturally decline with age in both humans and mice, but exercise training can restore them. In aged mice, CLCF1 treatment improved grip strength, running endurance, muscle fiber size, and bone density. The protein enhanced cellular energy production, particularly glucose metabolism, and activated pathways involved in muscle growth. For bones, CLCF1 suppressed bone-destroying cells while promoting bone-building cells. Mice genetically engineered to overproduce CLCF1 showed enhanced physical performance, while blocking CLCF1 activity eliminated most of exercise’s beneficial effects. In humans, resistance training and high-intensity exercise increased blood CLCF1 levels, but moderate aerobic exercise did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The human studies involved relatively small sample sizes and should be considered exploratory. Most dramatic anti-aging effects were demonstrated in mice, and findings may not fully translate to humans. The research focused primarily on resistance and high-intensity exercise, leaving questions about other forms of physical activity. Some human cohort baseline CLCF1 levels varied significantly between groups, particularly in elite athletes, which may have influenced results. The muscle-specific knockout experiments showed less pronounced effects than expected, suggesting other cell types may also contribute to CLCF1 production during exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

(WHAM) — &lt;a href="https://townandcountrysolutions.com/" target="_blank" title="https://townandcountrysolutions.com/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country Pest Solutions&lt;/a&gt; has been helping people locally and across the state get rid of pests for the last 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rats in general are horrible all over Rochester," said Caleb Fabry, the company's president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said Town &amp;amp; Country's phones have been ringing nonstop for the last six months, with some of the worst infestations he's ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ten years ago, we would get calls, but it was here and there," he said. "(Now) we're seeing them every day. We're seeing some of the worst infestations we've ever seen in the Rochester area. I would say that it's aligning with what you would expect in a bigger city like New York City and things like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the pest control company went out to a home in Gates whose owner had to be removed due to the condition of her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a really sad situation," Fabry said. "She was living there last week, and her mattress is on the floor. She's an elderly lady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said the home was littered with urine and feces from pests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We go in there to evaluate how we can stop it, and there's rats everywhere," Fabry continued. "I'm telling you, she was just sleeping in this house a prior week. Rats everywhere. There was a chicken running around in the house. That story is, I want to say it's unusual, but we're seeing more like that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabry said not only do rodents cause damage to property, but they can also carry diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've recently heard some famous people down in New Mexico died of hantavirus, and it is from rats and mice, and it's the viruses that they spread, and these things are real and that’s what pest control does," he said. "We're in charge of public health, and in so many ways, but you have to take it serious and just us coming in and trapping and giving you all the good ideas doesn't solve it. You have to do something, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>13wham.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 21:05:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxNSzU0Rm9CRDFZb1NsS1RZVWxjdDFZMmdRWGFSSksyM3phQUtPcENyUU04ZDktYWttRW5DS0EyOG01NkNSS1hZeEw4eVI0dHVpMHZCX3BPY1JpbmxrdUE2SlFodEtvVl8zUGFkTW5OVF9URUwxbzZ6QlYySkRpaHVHNmxWZ184ZWFGRHlQNDFsOVhyWDk4OEZGTVZSaGFnbEFZMlpwWkY2WUdPRVBBSVFGNW1xQnNUZkxIcjJYMkFhYTdtZUZYWVZxUS1wSk5qYVlPZ3k0Ml8yT1VCS2JULTNmeERpZF90YWlqdU1V</guid></item><item><title>患有自闭症的两个儿子的妈妈在患有食肉病后截肢： “我无法照顾我的孩子” - AOL.com | Mom of 2 Sons with Autism Has Limbs Amputated After Flesh-Eating Disease: 'I Can't Take Care of My Children’ - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE4xNnBNRWE4eVVWdHNMMU12UXF1VUxlUE1SYmNiMm1oQldtem0zNlM3d3Y1eElXSGltNS11U0lOX0ZMaVlHdE9yUDZLZFZVNHNTRXk2ZnJJWEkzemh4ajhTNVFidE5RdFl0SlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;gofundme&lt;/p&gt; Arisbeth Muñoz is raising money for prosthetics after having three limbs and part of her hand amputated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NEED TO KNOW&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arisbeth Muñoz, 39, was diagnosed in December with the flu and strep A, which triggered a life-threatening infection that lasted months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Muñoz developed necrotizing fasciitis, doctors amputated her legs below the knees, her right arm, and part of her left hand to stop the spread of the infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mom of two boys who have autism is raising money for prosthetics so she can support her sons at their school meetings, and says “I’m grateful because I’m alive and I can stay with my kids"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 39-year-old mom of two is raising money for prosthetics after having her legs, right arm, and part of her left hand &lt;a href="https://people.com/hiker-burn-camping-skillet-sepsis-double-amputation-exclusive-8779198" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amputated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amputated&lt;/a&gt;, the result of a deadly infection triggered by the flu and strep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arisbeth Muñoz, who lives in San Diego, went to the emergency room last December 28 when she began vomiting and experienced pain in her side. There, tests confirmed she had the &lt;a href="https://people.com/flu-complications-girl-4-goes-into-cardiac-arrest-11689798" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-raises-awareness-for-invasive-strep-a-after-losing-her-3-year-old-daughter-to-the-disease-8764263" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Group A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Group A &lt;/a&gt;strep — common infections that can be treated with antibiotics and over-the-counter remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But from that point, her condition rapidly deteriorated. Muñoz shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-arisbeth-munoz-walk-again-fund-prosthetics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;: “Having been perfectly fine that morning, my body was now in a state of sepsis,” a life-threatening infection that can occur when the body improperly responds to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;gofundme&lt;/p&gt; Arisbeth Muñoz is raising money for prosthetics after having three limbs and part of her hand amputated.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The doctors [said] that I will pass away that night,” she told &lt;a href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/logan-heights-mom-survives-flesh-eating-infection-faces-life-with-amputations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ABC News 10;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ABC News 10&lt;/a&gt;, sharing that she was placed in a medically induced coma until February. Her condition continued to decline. Muñoz had a heart attack, struggled with an internal hemorrhage, and developed &lt;a href="https://people.com/flesh-eating-bacteria-survivor-finds-new-purpose-outdoors-8659463" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:necrotizing fasciitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/a&gt; — commonly called the flesh-eating bacteria — which resulted in the amputation of her legs under the knee, her right arm, and part of her left hand, to stop the infection’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I saw my arms and legs: darkness.

I can't take care of my children 100%," Muñoz told ABC. As she shared in the GoFundMe, she now desperately needs prosthetics to properly look after “my two sons, Matthew and Enrique, who are autistic and who have relied heavily on me in terms of care, as well as to be present at their therapy, evaluation and medical appointments. Now, during this trying time, I desire nothing more than to continue to care for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she's managing as best as she can, she told ABC: "I can eat [by] myself and brush my teeth by myself," Muñoz said. “I can push myself out of the bed on my side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as she shared, “I’m grateful because I’m alive and I can stay with my kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-amputation-flesh-eating-disease-two-sons-autism-11758481" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:55:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE4xNnBNRWE4eVVWdHNMMU12UXF1VUxlUE1SYmNiMm1oQldtem0zNlM3d3Y1eElXSGltNS11U0lOX0ZMaVlHdE9yUDZLZFZVNHNTRXk2ZnJJWEkzemh4ajhTNVFidE5RdFl0SlE</guid></item><item><title>科学家表示，性药物伟哥具有令人惊讶的新健康益处，可以帮助300万英国老年人- the-sun.com | Sex drug Viagra has surprising new health benefit and could help 3 million ageing Brits, say scientists - the-sun.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPRlEzbENPUE5Dc0NoS3NSV2pWVENmWXZ3SjZDZDlzRXFNVDBObzNRU1VpYkNaZnBuYmxBaHV2cjBtM0xtQXJmZWhuQmVoYU0tWW9TNEdxZ1c3dFRKLW1mUU9weW96YzFhTHc3WnFvMkZZc2ZaMnFWRGVQcmxaX1R0MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEX aid pill Viagra helps stiffen your skeleton, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little blue tablet was found to increase production of vital bone cells — so could one day prevent back pain and fractures in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-container-placeholder lazyload" data-name="news" data-value="The US Sun" data-login-link="https://login.the-sun.com" data-isgeneric="true" data-widget-name="newsletter"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found sildenafil, which is branded as &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/11921920/record-amounts-viagra-prescribed-nhs/" rel=""&gt;Viagra&lt;/a&gt;, helped human stem cells transform into osteoblasts, the bone-building cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are vital as the human skeleton regenerates and is completely replaced roughly once every ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, we lose more bone than we build, increasing the risk of breaks or osteoporosis, which makes bones brittle and painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Peking University team’s follow-up tests on mice also suggested sildenafil would prevent bone loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Menglong Hu and Dr Likun Wu said: “Our findings offer new insights into the physiological effects of the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sildenafil enhanced stem cell osteogenic differentiation and inhibited bone loss ­— it may usefully treat osteoporosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three million Britons suffer &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/13791645/how-to-protect-bones-osteoporosis-fractures/" rel=""&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;.

In acute pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn reduce their activity through a natural “braking” system involving A-type potassium currents, helping limit pain signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in chronic pain, this mechanism fails, and the neurons become overactive, continuing to send pain messages. This discovery provides a clearer biological pathway for how pain becomes chronic and may guide future therapies aimed at restoring this internal regulation system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brainstem Relay Dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; In chronic pain, neurons in the medullary dorsal horn lose their ability to dampen pain signals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A-Type Potassium Current (IA):&lt;/strong&gt; This current acts as a brake in acute pain but fails to activate in chronic pain conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Implication:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting IA could be a novel strategy to prevent or treat chronic pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does some pain go away while other types linger, turning into chronic suffering? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study from scientists at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem may have uncovered part of the answer — deep inside the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111075"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/brainstemy-chronic-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published this week in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, researchers led by Doctoral student Ben Title under the guidance of Prof. Alexander M. Binshtok from The Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Medicine and the Center for Brain Sciences (ELSC) at The Hebrew University, reveal that our bodies respond to acute (short-term) and chronic (long-lasting) pain in surprisingly different ways at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their discovery sheds new light on how pain becomes chronic — and opens the door to better-targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Brain’s “Pain Relays” Behave Differently in Acute vs. Chronic Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team studied a small but crucial region in the brainstem called the medullary dorsal horn, home to neurons that act as a relay station for pain signals. These projection neurons help send pain messages from the body to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that during acute inflammatory pain, these neurons actually dial down their own activity. This built-in “braking system” helps limit the amount of pain-related signals sent to the brain. Once the inflammation and pain subside, the neurons return to their normal state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in chronic pain, this braking system fails. The neurons don’t reduce their activity — in fact, they become more excitable and fire more signals, potentially contributing to the persistence of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Key Player: A-Type Potassium Current&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of electrophysiology and computer modeling, the researchers identified a key mechanism: a specific potassium current known as the A-type potassium current (IA). This current helps regulate the excitability of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In acute pain, IA increases — acting like a natural sedative for the pain pathways. But in chronic pain, this current doesn’t ramp up, and the neurons become hyperactive. The absence of this regulation may be one of the biological switches that turns temporary pain into a long-lasting condition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications for Chronic Pain Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve seen how the same neurons behave so differently in acute versus chronic pain,” said Prof. Binshtok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that this natural ‘calming’ mechanism is missing in chronic pain suggests a new target for therapy. If we can find a way to restore or mimic that braking system, we might be able to prevent pain from becoming chronic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Step Toward Smarter Pain Therapies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain affects over 50 million people in the U.S. alone, often with few effective treatment options. This new study adds an important piece to the puzzle by showing how the nervous system’s built-in pain controls are disrupted in long-term pain conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By understanding the brain’s own strategies for limiting pain — and why they sometimes fail — scientists are now one step closer to developing smarter, more precise therapies for those who suffer from chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8eeaefe0efebe3edcefdeff8e7e1e0a0e6fbe4e7a0efeda0e7e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Danae Marx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://huji.ac.il" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Danae Marx – Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr3467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Opposite regulation of medullary pain-related projection neuron excitability in acute and chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander M.

If seeking in-person medical attention, call ahead to inform your doctor, urgent care, or emergency room of the potential measles exposure before arrival so facilities may take precautions to prevent exposure to other individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, if it has been less than six days since the potential exposure, you may be able to receive post-exposure treatment that could prevent illness. Contact your healthcare provider, pharmacy, or local health department for vaccination and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GTCHD has a measles hotline that can be reached during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at 231-995-6800. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the line will be monitored from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Saturday, June 21st, and from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Sunday, June 22nd.  If outside of office hours, Grand Traverse County residents can also contact 2-1-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Disease investigations performed by our local health department are critical to ensuring we can limit the impact of diseases such as measles in our community,” said Mike Lahey, Health Officer at GTCHD. "It is important to consider staying up-to-date on all routine vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, to prevent the spread of severe illness and disease."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPBN</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:15:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNRjk0N1BvLTNRekJxNHpWbE1BVkhVQkVEMVRjLWxyWl9VbklRLThqcVVqOGpNdmFMVW5FOTFtdnlKa1NCTTFuNWw2U05ac29UU0ljVnBqZ19GOTljc3YyREQ3Sm1UMVU1Vkpxekk2UGVOdHJ0bE9MdEFNQXNxcnRmNVhmakVCM1REX204SkV1WkpPdG1TLUxBcGFxbHFOZ0hvcExDMUF3TDVCaU1MUHNJMXFFb0lvUFFVVTl4cw</guid></item><item><title>可以通过2汤匙一种食物来降低癌症、糖尿病和心脏病的风险- Surrey Live | Cancer, diabetes and heart disease risk can be lowered by 2 tablespoons of one food - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNVzJfM2NGSGcwRVhqWXpMZlVmMWJaOWhvSEo4cEdkMTJyTG9ZaEtLclNhQmRUUFhpR0ROdldsWFNLLTl6a2RNRDdVQjFqYUtITDhyd2pxdFRON0tyTHh0UEpZUkFBM1V4SzhjdWlQVF9wcmRBM2Y0ZjBrUWpFVE5OU0NRelB4TmNWMEpz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scientist and professor says eating a couple of spoonfuls of a common and inexpensive food which you probably already have in your kitchen cupboard can lower your risk of developing &lt;a data-content-type="news" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/health/only-two-foods-cause-cancer-31898269" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;several serious and chronic illnesses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Dan Gubler, who has a PhD in organic chemistry and studies how natural molecules in foods and plants can improve health, says peanut butter has several health benefits that can help sustain good health.

No."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if you're wondering how much peanut butter you should eat, Dr Gubler said: "One to two tablespoons a day."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although this might all sound too good to be true, the health benefits of peanut butter are well-established.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How does peanut butter support your heart?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Peanut butter is rich in heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and contains no bad cholesterol. Research has &lt;a href="https://foodandnutritionresearch.net/index.php/fnr/article/view/8961" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;linked nut and seed consumption with lower risk of heart disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt; and one study found that &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2022.853378/full" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;regular peanut intake (including as peanut butter) for six months was able to significantly improve cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian and personal trainer Wan Na Chun told Eating Well: "Peanut butter is a good source of heart-healthy monounsaturated fats, which can help lower LDL (harmful) cholesterol and triglyceride levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How does peanut butter lower risk of diabetes?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Walter C. Willett, professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health, &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/ask-the-doctor-why-is-peanut-butter-healthy-if-it-has-saturated-fat" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; : "Over the years, numerous studies have shown that people who regularly include nuts or peanut butter in their diets are less likely to develop heart disease or type 2 diabetes than those who rarely eat nuts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"One serving (about 2 tablespoons) has... 12.3 grams of unsaturated fat, or about 80% unsaturated fat. Peanut butter also gives you some fibre, some vitamins and minerals (including 200 milligrams of potassium), and other nutrients."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist Lisa Andrews told Eating Well: "Peanut butter is a great choice for individuals trying to manage their blood sugar. Fat and protein in peanut butter are slowly absorbed and help to keep blood sugar levels more stable."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07315724.2018.1519404" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;a study has shown&lt;/a&gt; that eating two tablespoons of peanut butter with a high-glycemic meal helped stabilise blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;How does peanut butter lower risk of cancer?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt; Peanut butter is high in antioxidants, which are nutrients found in food that play a crucially important role in keeping you healthy and your body working better for longer. Antioxidants help prevent cell damage caused by "free radicals". While free radicals are essential for your health, having an excess of them in your body leads to "oxidative stress", &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3614697/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;which damages healthy cells&lt;/a&gt; and has been linked to several serious chronic conditions like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2835914/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, dementia and cancer, as well as premature ageing and the risk of stroke. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Peanuts provide multiple antioxidants, including vitamin E, coumaric acid, resveratrol and p-coumarin. These may help to protect against heart disease and cancer," registered dietitian nutritionist Lisa Andrews told Eating Well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;What are other health benefits of peanut butter?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Weight loss and weight management:&lt;/b&gt; People assume that because peanut butter is high in calories that it cannot be good for weight loss and may even cause weight gain. However, research has found that consuming nuts and peanut butter does not prevent weight loss and may even help people manage their weight because their combination of protein, fats and fibre promotes satiety, helping you feel fuller for longer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Helps the immune system:&lt;/b&gt; Peanut butter's nutritional make-up can help strengthen the body's immune system, which defends against infection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Good source of fibre:&lt;/b&gt; Fibre is crucially important but has been called the world's "most under-rated nutrient" because it is rarely talked about and drowned out by the current obsession with protein.

However, it does pay to check the ingredients list on the back of the jar. The healthiest peanut butter will contain nothing other than peanuts. But lots of brands add sugar, and some smooth peanut varieties may include extra ingredients to give it the smooth texture and make it more spreadable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNVzJfM2NGSGcwRVhqWXpMZlVmMWJaOWhvSEo4cEdkMTJyTG9ZaEtLclNhQmRUUFhpR0ROdldsWFNLLTl6a2RNRDdVQjFqYUtITDhyd2pxdFRON0tyTHh0UEpZUkFBM1V4SzhjdWlQVF9wcmRBM2Y0ZjBrUWpFVE5OU0NRelB4TmNWMEpz</guid></item><item><title>犹他县多年来首例麻疹病例报告- KSL新闻 | Utah's first measles case in years reported in Utah County - KSL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOM2oxcTFXUjhJZnNLR2xrUFVZUWhjci1vZ3o3WVI4SWZ0d2ptdnJiSWtVeGF4T0ZGUmVaNGVmR0d6SVp4NFRnaENOUzhyZk5kZWdtMmRTVjVDZllEclFjN1VhQTBXYW55Zjk0Q2Q1LWZDY2pQeVhTejJRcWd2WVZoczMxVlhMT01mdzh4U0t2cmdwVllzUklZNUFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY – Utah public health officials announced the first case of measles to originate in the state in at least two years, urging those who may have come in contact with the person to watch closely for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a release, the Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it has "identified an adult from Utah County who has been diagnosed with measles." On Friday, Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, said the person is between 20 and 40 years old, she but did not identify the individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said the person was unvaccinated "and has no out-of-state exposures, which indicates the infection was transmitted within Utah." The release stated that the department had identified anyone else with measles as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ksl-article-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said during thier "infectious period but prior to diagnosis," the person visited "several" public places. This included the Timpanogos Regional Emergency Room on June 14 between 2:14 p.m. and 7:02 p.m., and the Parkway Health Center in Orem on June 13, though no specific time was immediately known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said the individual visited healthcare providers due to measles symptoms and was advised to stay home to quarantine, which they reportedly did following their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urged those who may have crossed paths with the infected Utah County resident, especially those who are unvaccinated, to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do have to suspect there are additional measles cases in Utah," Nolen said, noting the affected individual had not traveled outside of the state, pointing to the disease originating from Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not been able to identify how that happened, so certainly there is some person who was able to transmit the virus to this individual. So we do think there are additional cases," Nolen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Measles symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department said measles symptoms appear seven to 14 days after exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who have a high fever (higher than 102.2°F or 39°C) and a cough, runny nose or red eyes may have early stages of measles," the department said. "A rash will usually appear after four days of fever."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash, usually showing up first at the hairline then spreading down a person's body, is described as one of the main identifying signs of measles, Nolen said in a press conference Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department noted that a person with measles can spread the disease before symptoms occur. Health officials urged those who develop symptoms to steer clear of others and call their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Call first before you go to a clinic or hospital to prevent other people from exposure," the department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the department, over "90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles and are highly protected against infection." The department noted that infants under 1 year old cannot get the vaccine, meaning they are not protected from measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen recommended people speak with their clinicians to track down what vaccines they've had and learn more about an option to get an antibody test that will show if antibodies are present. Nolen noted there is no danger in having additional doses of the vaccination. It is recommended that people get two doses of the vaccine to make sure they are fully protected, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health in Utah wants to reassure the community that immediate action is being taken to contain the situation," the department said. "We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nolen said in the press conference that the last case of measles in Utah occurred two years ago, "in an international traveler."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story may be updated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL News</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:12:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOM2oxcTFXUjhJZnNLR2xrUFVZUWhjci1vZ3o3WVI4SWZ0d2ptdnJiSWtVeGF4T0ZGUmVaNGVmR0d6SVp4NFRnaENOUzhyZk5kZWdtMmRTVjVDZllEclFjN1VhQTBXYW55Zjk0Q2Q1LWZDY2pQeVhTejJRcWd2WVZoczMxVlhMT01mdzh4U0t2cmdwVllzUklZNUFB</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家的“达到100岁”指南-它不涉及严格的饮食- Surrey Live | Cardiologist's guide to 'reach 100 years old' - it doesn't involve strict diets - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxNYlFtWTBVbjc1SnM0MFlvWm13RVp2di1Nc09hWDZNV25ITklZZk1yRmhsc2Fnc0VNdkpuNUZnNjJLNjQ2UWNaMUdzOUtGMU5EOEU1YmxwVGdNMHhENlQzazIzbEIxbjBiMzh3OF9ya2Q3aTI3YUhCX3FUSVpsbEE3LTF1TzBkaUkweEt1Xw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching 100 years old may seem like a far-off goal, but don't despair. A cardiologist suggests there are methods to potentially improve your odds, which he summarised into four key steps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While you might imagine intense workout routines and strict diets, Dr Jorge Tartaglione reassured that this isn't needed. He instead emphasised that it's mainly about following a few simple principles when making daily choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"In the world, there are five zones that, for different reasons, predispose their inhabitants to longevity with much vitality," he said in a recent interview with Argentine news outlet&lt;a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/sociedad/video-un-especialista-revela-los-secretos-para-llegar-a-los-100-anos-en-forma-plena-y-vital-nid05062025/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt; La Nacion&lt;/a&gt;. "In any case, to live 100 years, you don’t necessarily have to be born in these places. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Someone living elsewhere can also achieve it. It’s just a matter of making the decision and implementing the four key principles." While there is no guaranteed way to live to 100 years old, Dr Tartaglione's advice could guide you toward that goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surrey Live has summarised his core principles and the supporting scientific evidence below.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Socialise more&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turns out that talking with friends and family can be more than just a simple pastime. Dr Tartaglione indicated that it could also provide long-term benefits for our cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The cardiologist isn't the only one who holds this view. A recent &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/79/11/glae233/7761934" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;University of South Australia&lt;/a&gt; study observed the daily routines of 397 adults to identify habits that most effectively promote long-term health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Results indicated that although watching TV and playing video games might contribute to cognitive decline, activities such as talking and praying could help strengthen brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Maddison Mellow, who worked on the project, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1067849" target="_self" rel="nofollow"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; last year: "We found that sedentary behaviours which promote mental stimulation or social engagement – such as reading or talking with friends – are beneficial for cognitive function, whereas others like watching TV or &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/" target="_blank"&gt;gaming&lt;/a&gt; have a negative effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"So, the type of activity is important. And, while the 'move more, sit less' message certainly holds true for cardiometabolic and brain health, our research shows that a more nuanced approach is needed when it comes to thinking about the link between sedentary behaviours and cognitive function."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results emerge amid increasing concern over dementia, which includes conditions marked by a gradual decline in cognitive function. In 2023, dementia and Alzheimer's disease ranked as the leading causes of death in England and Wales, with a total of 66,876 fatalities, as reported by the&lt;a href="https://cy.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathregistrationsummarystatisticsenglandandwales/2023#:~:text=The%20leading%20cause%20of%20death,11.4%25%20of%20all%20deaths)." target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt; Office for National Statistics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Stay active&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While you don't have to run the New York marathon to maintain good health, Dr Tartaglione emphasised the importance of regular exercise. He is not alone in this view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Last year,&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/more-than-2200-steps-a-day-might-help-you-live-longer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt; a study &lt;/a&gt;found that walking up to 10,500 steps daily reduced the risk of early death by 39% and lowered the chances of heart attack or stroke by 21%. &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00184-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Additionally, recent research&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this month suggests that even small amounts of high-intensity exercise or brisk walking can decrease dementia risk by up to 40%.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.gareth.nye" target="_self" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr Gareth Nye&lt;/a&gt;, a Biomedical Science lecturer at the University of Salford, also previously told &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/im-doctor-four-things-vital-35264083" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;the Mirror&lt;/a&gt;: "People who live longer tend to have a higher activity level in their day-to-day lives rather than focus on structured exercise programmes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The message here is that trying to incorporate more activity throughout the day is key and avoiding prolonged periods of sitting down. Those in offices could switch to standing desks, for example, or look at their commute to make changes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Current &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;NHS &lt;/a&gt;guidance states that adults should engage in some form of physical activity daily. Even just one or two sessions each week can greatly lower the risk of heart disease and strokes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Get more sleep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, Dr Tartaglione emphasised the importance of adequate rest and downtime, highlighting benefits that extend well beyond simply feeling energised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2856739/#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20sleep%20duration%20is,from%20the%207%E2%80%938hr%20range." target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that sleeping seven to eight hours is linked to the lowest risk of early mortality. &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/lack-sleep-middle-age-may-increase-dementia-risk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Moreover, a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; discovered that people in their 50s and 60s who sleep six hours or less per night face an increased risk of dementia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings arrive amidst a situation where over 944,000 people in the UK are affected by dementia. In light of this, Dr Nye also said previously: "The recommendation is that seven to eight hours of interrupted sleep has the lowest risk of premature death. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Shorter than seven hours of sleep daily is linked to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2864873/#:~:text=Pooled%20analyses%20indicate%20that%20short,to%208%20h%20per%20night." target="_self" rel="nofollow"&gt;12% increased [risk of] death&lt;/a&gt;, with those who sleep over eight hours being linked to a 30% increased chance of premature death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It seems that having regular sleep patterns may be the key to getting the most benefit and potentially living longer."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Sustain a healthy diet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, Dr Tartaglione highlighted the significance of consuming the 'right things' for your body. Although strict diets aren't necessary, he underscored the advantages of eating raw produce from greengrocers and butchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other experts, including Dr Nye, also emphasise that avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and foods rich in saturated fats is crucial, as each of these is linked to potential health risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The less processing, the better," Dr Nye said, mirroring Dr Tartaglione's views. "Meat and vegetables, as free range or organic as possible, will have the least chance of impacting the body negatively. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The more processing involved, the more detrimental it is to the body, mainly due to preservative agents. [For instance], ham and bacon increase your risk of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Avoid added sugar or sugar that isn't part of the required diet. Those from areas that live longer will consume similar amounts of sugar from their diet, but have drastically lower added sugar in foods and lower levels of sweet treats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 20:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNYlFtWTBVbjc1SnM0MFlvWm13RVp2di1Nc09hWDZNV25ITklZZk1yRmhsc2Fnc0VNdkpuNUZnNjJLNjQ2UWNaMUdzOUtGMU5EOEU1YmxwVGdNMHhENlQzazIzbEIxbjBiMzh3OF9ya2Q3aTI3YUhCX3FUSVpsbEE3LTF1TzBkaUkweEt1Xw</guid></item><item><title>高胆固醇药物作为“靶向痴呆症”的突破- Surrey Live | High cholesterol drug breakthrough as 'targets dementia' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQU1hyMldwal9OSUZfUUdHd3BNdVRsOXozd2tTODhRRi1rMnI1Q00wWUZkZ0dqbXVBQkhfWWdCMkNWNXFqRVd2akZ1S3JmWlZlckx4Z1o0cmhZdmtjRER4emJuYUZKT0VQRlZSSE9qZF9FWk40R0g5SU9JYVFYcThBc1RtT29LazNXQUp5eTdjZTV6QUxuOFE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol-lowering drugs have been associated with a decreased risk of dementia, according to a recent study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statins, one of the most frequently prescribed medications in the UK, are taken by approximately seven to eight million people to reduce their likelihood of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research now suggests they may offer additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that individuals with low levels of "bad" cholesterol in their blood have a lower risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the use of statins was found to provide "additional protective effects".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statins are a group of drugs that can help decrease the amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often referred to as "bad cholesterol", LDL cholesterol (LDL- C) can lead to plaque build-up in arteries, resulting in cardiovascular disease, which increases the risk of strokes, heart attacks and death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;South Korean researchers stated that their findings "underscore the crucial role of managing LDL- C in lowering dementia risk".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study analysed health data from over 570,000 individuals in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; recommends aiming for bad cholesterol levels in the blood to be below 4mmol/L (millimoles per litre).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers discovered that individuals with LDL cholesterol levels below 1.8 mmol/L had a 26% lower risk of dementia and a 28% reduced risk of Alzheimer's compared to those with LDL cholesterol levels above 3.4 mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statin use appeared to offer additional protection against dementia when LDL cholesterol levels were low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among individuals with LDL cholesterol levels below 1.8 mmol/L, statin use was associated with a 13% reduction in dementia risk and a 12% decrease in the risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to non-users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These findings emphasise the importance of targeted LDL- C management as part of dementia prevention strategies, with potential integration into clinical guidelines," the authors penned in the Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The results support the use of statin therapy within specific LDL- C ranges for both cardiovascular and cognitive health benefits."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They added: "This insightful understanding of how statin use interacts with LDL- C levels emphasises the need for personalised statin prescriptions, focusing on achieving LDL- C levels that offer the maximum cognitive benefits."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commenting on the study, Dr Julia Dudley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "This large study looked at patient records for levels of LDL cholesterol and the risk of dementia, it also examined those patients who were on statins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It found that those people with lower LDL levels had a reduced risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The use of statins seemed to offer a protective effect – even in those who already had cholesterol levels within a lower range.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"However, dementia risk is complex and influenced by many factors. Without a detailed picture of what's going on in the brain we do not know if there is a direct link between lower cholesterol and reduced dementia risk. Clinical trials will be key to understand what effects statins might be having on disease processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"In the meantime, keeping our hearts healthy remains one of the most effective ways we can protect our brain health. If you have any concerns about your cholesterol levels, you should speak to your GP."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Richard Oakley from the Alzheimer's Society added: "Dementia risk is complicated and determined by several factors including genetics, lifestyle, and the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This study adds to our understanding by showing the strong connection between heart and brain health. Simply put, what is good for the heart is good for the head."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further stated: "This is an ever-evolving topic, and more targeted research and trials are needed to understand whether statins can help protect the brain. However, it is crucial to talk to your GP before making any changes to your medication".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:55:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQU1hyMldwal9OSUZfUUdHd3BNdVRsOXozd2tTODhRRi1rMnI1Q00wWUZkZ0dqbXVBQkhfWWdCMkNWNXFqRVd2akZ1S3JmWlZlckx4Z1o0cmhZdmtjRER4emJuYUZKT0VQRlZSSE9qZF9FWk40R0g5SU9JYVFYcThBc1RtT29LazNXQUp5eTdjZTV6QUxuOFE</guid></item><item><title>犹他州报告了首例麻疹病例。以下是您需要了解的信息。-《盐湖论坛报》 | Utah reports its first measles case.

The person, who was not further identified, is unvaccinated and had no out-of-state exposures, indicating the infection was transmitted within Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-element"&gt;&lt;div class="image-rootCenter"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1ez1ofp"&gt;&lt;span class=" lazy-load-image-background "&gt;&lt;span class="image-img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="caption-credit"&gt;(Francisco Kjolseth  | The Salt Lake Tribune) Public health officials warn of the first verified case of measles in Utah as Dr. Leisha Nolen, state epidemiologist, gives an update on a adult from Utah County diagnosed with the highly contagious disease on Friday, June 20, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;At a press conference Friday, state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen said officials have not yet identified the source of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“We do think there are additional cases,” Nolen said. “At this time, we have not identified others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Nolen said the infected person is isolating at home with minimal contact. The Utah County Health Department has been working closely with the person and their family, she said, advising exposed relatives to monitor symptoms and stay home to prevent further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Before their diagnosis, the Utah County resident visited several public places during their infectious period, health officials said. People who were at those sites during or two hours after that person may have been exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Two of those locations were:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt; • &lt;b&gt;The Parkway Health Center&lt;/b&gt;, 145 W. 1300 South, Orem, sometime on June 13. Health officials are trying to confirm a specific time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt; • &lt;b&gt;Timpanogos Regional ER&lt;/b&gt;, 750 W. 800 North, Orem, June 14, between 2:14 and 7:02 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;DHHS is urging people who were in those locations at those times to monitor themselves for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Measles symptoms typically appear seven to 14 days after exposure. They include a high fever — above 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit — and a cough, runny nose, or red eyes. A rash will usually appear within four days of a fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“The rash is really what hints to us that this is measles,” Nolen said, noting that it typically begins at the hairline and spreads down the body. “It can take up to three weeks from being exposed to actually start to have the symptoms, but usually it’s about 10 days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;If you develop symptoms, stay away from other people and call your health care provider, health officials say. Call before going to a clinic or hospital, so staff there can prevent other people from exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;As of Thursday, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported&lt;/a&gt; a total of 1,214 confirmed measles cases in 34 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In early June, &lt;a href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2025/06/04/utah-officials-warn-potential/"&gt;DHHS reported&lt;/a&gt; that an infected out-of-state person traveled through Utah’s Washington County, visiting family in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to DHHS, more than 90% of Utahns have been vaccinated against measles, and are well protected against infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, or MMR, Nolen said, “make you 97% sure that you will not get the infection. … And even if you do get the infection after that vaccine, it’s going to be much more mild than if you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;There are exceptions, though: Infants younger than 1 year old, for example, are not eligible for the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Public health officials urge Utahns to check their immunization and medical records, or talk to a health care provider to see whether they were protected against measles. That’s especially true for people who are planning to travel outside the state or the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;“It’s important to recognize that this is a controllable outbreak,” Nolen said, stressing the critical role of vaccination in reducing the risk of infection. “Unfortunately, measles does cause really severe disease, so one in 20 kids will go into the hospital, and that’s really significant. We also know kids can die of this. We’ve already had three deaths in the United States. We don’t want any more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:01:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE4tMlNCcVBwVzRJV0tIY3UxN3dIZDhFb0RBVnViUGd3THlzNnl2bkU2akJMLTRuX3V0cE1PdGoyUEFiVEloaTNTbEthaGhlSm9Td1RhWWNJZEtyWVU4WjVnSEx4RUJ4VUQ4SHNSN193RmpJMnFIdHlYdzhpbw</guid></item><item><title>在中国飙升的新型冠状病毒变种已抵达美国。以下是关于Nimbus的注意事项- AOL.com | The new coronavirus variant surging in China has arrived in the US.

Experts in Europe are &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/slow-increases-covid-19-observed-across-eueea-new-variant-emerges" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predicting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;predicting&lt;/a&gt; a possible increase in cases there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A summer wave also could occur in the United States. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NB.1.8.1 already represents &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about one-third;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;about one-third&lt;/a&gt; of new Covid-19 cases as of June 7. This is a significant increase from just a month before, when the new variant represented just 5% of new Covid-19 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could another summer wave really occur? Do current vaccines still work, and if so, who should consider getting another dose now? And what precautions should people take to reduce their risk of contracting Covid-19?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What should people know about the new variant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The SARS-CoV-2 virus is constantly mutating, and it’s entirely expected that there will be new variants. The more opportunities the virus is given to spread, the more opportunities it has to mutate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time a new variant arises that appears to be outcompeting previous strains, it’s important to ask three questions: Is it causing more severe disease, is it more contagious, and do existing vaccines still work against it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new variant, NB.1.8.1, also called Nimbus, is a descendant of the Omicron strain. The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; has deemed the new strain a “variant under monitoring.” However, WHO also reports that surveillance data do not show that it has increased severity compared with previously circulating variants. Given that this strain is outcompeting previous variants, it’s possible that it could be more contagious, but there is nothing to suggest that it is being spread differently compared with past variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for whether existing vaccines work against this variant, the answer is not known. WHO &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cites laboratory data;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cites laboratory data&lt;/a&gt; showing that it could have some immune escape, which means it may be less responsive to the immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection and suggesting a possible reduction in vaccine efficacy. At the same time, NB.1.8.1 is a close descendant of other strains against which the vaccines have efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect there will be more data available in the coming weeks, as federal health officials will soon decide the &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/fda-vaccine-advisers-recommend-sticking-jn1-strain-next-covid-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:formulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;formulation&lt;/a&gt; of this fall’s updated Covid-19 vaccine. Knowing that NB.1.8.1 constitutes a growing proportion of cases, they will most likely try to ensure that the formulation has efficacy again this variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What are symptoms of N.B.1.8.1 infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The symptoms appear to be similar to infection with other variants. There is a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large range of symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;large range of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and severity. Some patients may have allergy-like symptoms, such as stuffy and runny nose. Others may have cold- or flulike symptoms, with fever, sore throat, fatigue, headache and muscle or body aches. Some people may develop cough and difficulty breathing. Some may have nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most people will recover, some could become severely ill and require hospitalization. Some individuals who contract Covid-19 may also develop the post-viral condition known as long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Could another summer wave really happen again?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. It could be triggered by a new variant that’s more contagious and that has some degree of immune escape. A wave also could occur simply because of declining population immunity. Some experts believe that the emergence of this new strain combined with less recent Covid-19 activity could start a wave in the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we have seen from several years of experience with Covid-19 is that infections tend to come in waves. A surge in cases leads to many people falling ill, then recovering and developing short-term immunity to infection. Infection rates decline for several months, then they begin to increase again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/health/summer-covid-rise-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Summer waves of Covid-19;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Summer waves of Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; have occurred over the past few years. It’s certainly possible that the pattern repeats this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Who should consider getting the vaccine now instead of waiting for the fall formulation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a difficult question to answer because the landscape around Covid-19 vaccination has been changing. Just last month, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that Covid-19 shots &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are no longer recommended;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;are no longer recommended&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and pregnant women. These shots appear to still be accessible for children; for instance, the CDC’s guidance &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/children-covid-vaccine-cdc?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:now reads;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;now reads&lt;/a&gt; that children can get the shots after consulting with their health care provider. However, there are already &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of pregnant women having more difficulty obtaining these vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This and other guidance could soon change, as Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/kennedy-new-members-vaccine-advisory-panel?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reconstituted the panel;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reconstituted the panel&lt;/a&gt; of external experts who advise the CDC on vaccine recommendations, and this new panel could make different decisions during their upcoming meeting in late June. Another uncertainty is when a new round of vaccines will be made available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to approach this decision is to consider your risk of severe outcomes if you were to contract Covid-19. Those who are 65 and over or who have chronic underlying medical conditions should consider getting another dose of the vaccine now, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:if they are eligible;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;if they are eligible&lt;/a&gt;. That way, they have additional protection in case there is a summer wave, since the existing vaccine probably retains some efficacy against the new variant. And they can still get another dose in the fall when the new formulation will presumably be released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for those who are younger and generally healthy, some who have not yet received the 2024-25 formulation also may consider getting the vaccine now before guidelines change and they may no longer be eligible. People should discuss their specific medical situations with their primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What precautions should people consider to reduce their risk of contracting this variant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The same precautions we’ve been discussing throughout the Covid-19 pandemic still apply. This is a respiratory virus that could be airborne, so be on guard, particularly in crowded indoor settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are especially vulnerable to severe disease should try to avoid these settings. If they need to go into, say, a crowded train station, they should consider wearing a well-fitting N95 or equivalent mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those people visiting vulnerable individuals may wish to avoid higher-risk settings in the days before the visit to reduce the chance of spreading not only Covid-19 but also other respiratory illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 19:00:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQa2JsSXVjRHNmUjNtWWRkYmFwODFGOHdwX1FKTVlzMmY0N2paN3o5N3hJbW80X2NKYVRRUGtRd0VWMHM1dXZTdy1MSDhFMFROTFh4cFBPUWxwWm0yeVpVZ1VtR21xX2ZOdVpuSlFBZDRRYXdMZUVHSURxZ3ZqbXBHYkpB</guid></item><item><title>美国宇航局代理局长珍妮特·佩特罗（ Janet Petro ） “拥抱挑战”更新2025年6月20日-美国宇航局观察 | Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro ‘Embrace The Challenge’ Update June 20, 2025 - NASA Watch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxNOEN5SUNRUmxmUjRZLWJRSExETGJvODNZQUFZOGFNUGFlVG9HVHI3ZXBrcHBsekwxeFVRN0l1ZDVVcmV3VjhUazdsM0lMTXVYVHVzQkg3VTdkV2tJZU1vaVA2SkFFQTAxZ1I0NmstUUxtVV9KXzZFY2tmSF9DYVRkem5xQlV1ZUcwWFBwejFWMy1wTVl6MFJxZFg2dk5VUHpsbUE3R2hfY3RhM2lUNFV0OUR5MDRfajBsSnIwV1VlczRsUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith’s note:&lt;/strong&gt; this weekly ‘Embrace The Challenge Update’ includes a link to a site where y ou can post questions for a 25 June agency wide town hall. It asks for name an email. So I used &lt;em&gt;Wehrner von Braun – &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e192b263c202b3c0e202f3d2f60292138"&gt;[email protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and I got in and posted &lt;em&gt;“So much for cybersecurity.”&lt;/em&gt; FYI the comment field says “&lt;em&gt;After submitting, your question will enter a moderation queue for approval&lt;/em&gt;” – In other words someone is going to filter the questions that Janet answers. Of course no one would ever think of censoring any of the questions that touch on certain topics. Just sayin’. &lt;strong&gt;Full memo below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; As we move through summer, I know many of you are balancing mission demands, upcoming transitions, and well-earned time off. I want to thank you for everything you’re doing to keep us steady – whether you’re supporting a mission milestone, planning for what’s ahead, or helping maintain continuity at your center.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, we have an agencywide town hall scheduled for 1 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, June 25. You should have received a calendar invite, and &lt;a href="https://nasa.cnf.io/sessions/anq4/before?session_before_redirect=http%3A//nasa.cnf.io/sessions/anq4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here’s the link to submit questions online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Vanessa, Casey, Brian, and I know this is a challenging time, and we’re committed to having an open and honest conversation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ahead of that, I want to acknowledge the very real challenges many organizations are facing as we work through the potential for a more focused budget. These impacts vary across mission directorates, centers, and support offices, but no part of the agency is untouched. Some have asked why we’re acting now, or whether we should wait to see how Congress acts. The reality is we must make responsible choices based on the funding we are projected to receive and begin shaping the workforce toward the missions we’ve been called to do. Using voluntary tools like the Deferred Resignation Program, Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, and Voluntary Separation Incentive Payment now gives us the best chance to prepare for the next Fiscal Year without resorting to other more disruptive actions. These are NASA’s decisions, made in service of our mission, and our people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, a lot continues to happen across the agency:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More than 260 stakeholders from government, industry, and academia joined our Advanced Modeling &amp;amp; Simulation Seminar to learn about the Launch, Ascent, and Vehicle Aerodynamics (LAVA) framework as the team gears up for its public release this fall. The framework is a computational fluid dynamics software system that can accurately simulate challenging problems central to our mission, from aircraft performance evaluation to launch environment characterization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I signed a new agreement this week at the Paris Air Show with our longtime partners at the German Aerospace Center – DLR – that will extend our collaboration in space medicine research. As part of this effort, DLR will provide radiation sensors to fly aboard Orion during Artemis II, helping us better understand the health risks of deep space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, Expedition 73 aboard space station centered efforts on exercise research, spacesuit readiness, and science operations – including studying fluid behavior in microgravity using containerless liquid systems – while NASA teams on the ground continue to review the recent repair to the Zvezda module’s aft segment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our TRACERS mission has reached an important milestone this week. The twin spacecraft – designed to study how solar wind interacts with Earth’s magnetosphere – arrived at Vandenberg Space Force Base. They will soon be integrated with a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket ahead of a planned July launch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On June 13, years of space technology investments to expand commercial launch capabilities culminated in the successful maiden flight of UP Aerospace’s Spyder hypersonic rocket. The new launch system offers a low-cost vehicle to enable enhanced suborbital missions and planetary re-entry test environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to congratulate Rich Burns at Goddard and John Blevins at Marshall on being named 2025 Service to America Medal honorees – better known as the Sammies. Rich led the OSIRIS-REx mission, which successfully returned samples from asteroid Bennu and is helping us better understand the origins of our solar system. John, as chief engineer for SLS (Space Launch System) rocket, played a key role in the Artemis I mission and is helping us prepare for Artemis II. These awards recognize the highest levels of public service, and Rich and John’s work reflects the dedication and excellence that define our NASA team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Embrace the Challenge,&lt;/p&gt;

It has an average survival rate of 12 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, who posted his story in an &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1lbdcel/i_have_six_months_to_live_ama/"&gt;anonymous Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, has just six months left to live despite living 'a very healthy lifestyle' and having no family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I never smoked, almost never drank, ate clean and exercised daily. Sometimes biology lets you down.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer affects roughly 67,000 Americans every year and kills about 52,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than half the time, the disease is first spotted after it has already reached stage three or four due to its vague symptoms. These include abdominal pain, weight loss, back pain, jaundice and floating or clay-colored stools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads patients to assume their symptoms are from more benign causes like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was the case for Clair Honeywood, a 45-year-old from the UK who chocked her severe stomach pain up to IBS. She was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14392951/deadly-pancreatic-cancer-warning-signs-stomach-pain-IBS.html"&gt;given a year to live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Matthew Rosenblum of Michigan assumed his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13301841/diagnosed-lethal-pancreatic-cancer-miracle-drug-combo.html"&gt;bone-white stools&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 were from Crohn's disease, but it was actually stage four pancreatic cancer at age 32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear exactly what causes pancreatic cancer, but smoking, obesity and diabetes are thought to increase the risk by inducing harmful inflammation that causes cells to divide and become mutated more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man in the Reddit thread, however, blames his diagnosis on bad luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Before this diagnosis, I was in perfect health. I thought I had another 50 years left. The first thought was “This is too soon.”'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The former engineer said he will soon move into hospice care and try psilocybin therapy for pain and the mental health effects that have come with his diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, has been thought to reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also has signed up for several clinical trials. It's unclear if he will be getting standard treatments like chemotherapy or radiation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Clair Honeywood (left), 45, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at stage three after mistaking her symptoms for IBS. Matthew Rosenblum, meanwhile, thought his bone-white stools were from Crohn's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Early signs of pancreatic cancer include jaundice, stomach pain, back pain, weight loss, and floating stools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, he is focusing on using up his savings on vacations, scuba diving, skydiving and other items on his bucket list. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His main regret is not taking enough risks like 'starting a business, moving to another place, trying something you were interested in but didn't know if you could do.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the end, your failures are often not as consequential as you might think,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I’m glad I’ve been able to experience life. In all the possible realities I could’ve existed in, this was a pretty good one. Even if it’s short. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don’t have any grandiose aspirations for my legacy. A simple “that guy was alright” is good enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The biggest piece of advice I would give is to not take the time you have for granted. I know that’s probably a worn out statement, but it rings incredibly true when you realize how finite your life really is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 18:14:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPYjFjZHUzOHNGbG00bU9CUFBvXzdZemFYaVdRWnE0NEhXSndyeXFZcG42ZjVrZnQxOGN6cWRWcXhnR0ZXdV9TVFFndTA1NTBmckVqVndWalQzUEx4Qi1oZm54NEx0V1lETE1oQmNTdXFUY3RabllvM0Q4UjFyWFRwbTV0WjI3U3BLeGc2WExFb3hnUVRzQkFkWG0zZ1laVXJpSUNFbmxhYWFqQ0VEbC0xTDZR0gG3AUFVX3lxTE43RGp2R1RzTkFpS1RGWjd0eV9CVTFLazlvVkN3dlhfQ2NuOEdFQk1WNm5heUJKRENCczNTekJfTUxVU3VUOGhTR0VaeVVvS18zdG1jaERfOG1MeDdsMkYwX0NtMThUc2dUcUNzRzNzMXI3SnM0ZWlBYzROenl1VThrZ1J4RFg0VlBNVWtWcXk5cHJ0UmlsQTBMTGZhajlPeEVHeDJsS3JOUHkxaUR2d2tMZlowZ3l4aw</guid></item><item><title>疱疹病毒在感染后一小时内重塑人类DNA - Earth.com | Herpes virus reshapes human DNA within one hour of infection - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFBDX24tUV9hVGZPTC1weEItRHIwS0JCZmtHSzdqNXJBbVRmM19wRGI0Vm0tSFRQUWYtZFZXZ1RtMk9qNDZ3V19EQUpPSV9oaEFWVndVNm12eTVsdmpCUW9LeXJLQnB2U21Lbmd1NXgtRU5ESWRHOVl3RWN6aw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viruses have no life of their own. They survive only by entering living cells and stealing what they need. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is no different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known mostly for causing cold sores, this virus is silent in most people. But inside of our cells, the herpes virus does something extraordinary to DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; shows that HSV-1 does more than hijack the host’s machinery. It reshapes the 3D layout of the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-entire-human-genome-is-stored-on-this-disk-could-aliens-build-a-human-with-this-data-if-they-found-it/"&gt;human genome&lt;/a&gt;. This gives the virus access to specific human genes useful for its own replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HSV-1 is an opportunistic interior designer, reshaping the human genome with great precision and choosing which bits it comes into contact with,” explained Dr. Esther González Almela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reshaping is not a side effect; it is intentional. The virus rewires DNA contacts within hours of infection. These changes let HSV-1 build the perfect space to multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-herpes-virus-controls-dna"&gt;How the herpes virus controls DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within one hour of entering the cell, HSV-1 hijacks the host’s RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). This enzyme normally makes RNA from human DNA. The virus redirects it to copy its own genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topoisomerase I (TOP1), which snips DNA to relieve strain, joins the viral effort. Cohesin, which helps fold DNA, also moves toward the viral genome. Together, these enzymes help HSV-1 build viral replication compartments (VRCs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these compartments, human transcription slows dramatically. RNAP II and TOP1 abandon host DNA. As a result, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/gene-regulation-controlling-cells-to-improve-medical-treatments/"&gt;chromatin&lt;/a&gt; – the tightly packed form of DNA – collapses into a shell just 30% of its normal volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VRCs grow quickly. Host DNA is pushed to the edges of the nucleus. Human gene activity plummets. Viral RNA floods the cell within a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-turns-in-genome-folding"&gt;Surprising turns in genome folding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohesin partially joins the virus party and forms short loops near &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/preparing-for-the-next-pandemic-lessons-about-viral-transmission/"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt; DNA. But much of its usual function is lost. Some host DNA loops vanish, while others stay intact. The virus rewires specific loops to boost genes it benefits from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this damage, parts of the human genome resist. A/B compartments – large regions of active or inactive DNA – stay largely intact. This shows that chromatin can keep its broad structure, even under viral attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another twist: HSV-1 does not rely on altering chemical markers like H3K27me3 or H3K9me3. It leaves these epigenetic marks unchanged. Instead, it changes the physical shape and positioning of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always thought dense chromatin shut genes down but here we see the opposite: stop enough transcription first and the DNA compacts afterwards. The relationship between activity and structure might be a two-way street,” noted Dr. Álvaro Castells García from &lt;a href="http://portal.smu.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Southern Medical University&lt;/a&gt; in Guangzhou, China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-one-enzyme-blocks-the-virus"&gt;One enzyme blocks the virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a key weakness in the viral plan. Blocking just one host enzyme, TOP1, completely halted HSV-1’s genome reshaping. Without this enzyme, VRCs failed to form. The virus could not make a single new particle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In cell culture, inhibiting this enzyme stopped the infection before the virus could make a single new particle,” noted Professor Pia Cosma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOP1 is now a potential target for new &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/computer-model-can-identify-tumor-fighting-immune-cells/"&gt;therapies&lt;/a&gt;. Since nearly two-thirds of people under 50 carry HSV-1, a treatment like this could have a huge impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-herpes-virus-rewires-dna"&gt;The herpes virus rewires DNA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used advanced tools to uncover HSV-1’s tactics. Super-resolution microscopy let them see features just 20 nanometers wide. Hi-C showed which parts of DNA were in contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus genome tends to associate with active, gene-rich regions in human DNA. These contacts likely help the virus turn on the genes it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout infection, HSV-1 genome clusters remain stable in size. RNAP II binds closely to them. Cohesin binds loosely. This balance supports ongoing replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that HSV-1 does not just invade. It rewires and reorganizes &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-cells-communicate-with-each-other-through-rna/"&gt;human cells&lt;/a&gt; with precision. Right now, there is no cure for HSV-1. People can treat symptoms, but the virus stays in the body for life. This study shows a new way to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we stop the virus from reshaping human DNA early in the infection, we might stop it from spreading which could lead to new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60534-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 17:42:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFBDX24tUV9hVGZPTC1weEItRHIwS0JCZmtHSzdqNXJBbVRmM19wRGI0Vm0tSFRQUWYtZFZXZ1RtMk9qNDZ3V19EQUpPSV9oaEFWVndVNm12eTVsdmpCUW9LeXJLQnB2U21Lbmd1NXgtRU5ESWRHOVl3RWN6aw</guid></item><item><title>男性在获得捐赠肾脏后健康崩溃-它充斥着蠕虫- Ars Technica | Man’s health crashes after getting donated kidney—it was riddled with worms - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitAFBVV95cUxQVVdxSjBodGJCeThZSC1XTEpMLVh0Ny1rOExDam90WXhqVWgwbzd2VF9xY24zdzZBZWRoZHJIMWpLRFdVdHRpRkh3cGZkeWotc0V4WEVNTHhEQ0R4b2RXRHotU3F0alNBTkxOc1VhNy1tN2QyUWl6S3luRlZrc3lWSmVSczNfazA0TmlqX051MmdfRHFxWFVoYTFYeVNnUDVNa2J3aWlaeU9sbDNqWlpMYmdqOWw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;About two months after receiving a donated kidney, a 61-year-old man ended up back in the hospital. He was tired, nauseous, and vomiting. He was also excessively thirsty and producing too much urine. Over the next 10 days, things only got worse. The oxygen levels in his blood began to fall. His lungs filled with fluid. He kept vomiting. He couldn't eat. Doctors inserted a feeding tube. His oxygen levels and blood pressure kept falling. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and put on mechanical ventilation. Still, things kept getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that point, he was transferred to the ICU of Massachusetts General Hospital, where he had received the transplant. He was in acute respiratory failure and shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510"&gt;a case report in this week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, doctors at Mass General explained how they determined what was wrong with the man. Their first steps were collecting more information about the man's symptoms from his wife, reviewing his family medical history, and contacting the regional organ-procurement organization that provided the kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process of elimination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's condition and laboratory tests suggested he had some sort of infection. But as a transplant recipient who was on a variety of immunosuppressive drugs, the list of infectious possibilities was "extensive."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Camille Kotton, Clinical Director of the hospital's Transplant and Immunocompromised Host Infectious Diseases division, laid out her thinking. She started with a process of elimination. As an immunosuppressed transplant patient, he was also on several medications to proactively prevent infections. These would rule out herpesviruses and cytomegalovirus. He was also on a combination of antibiotics that would rule out many bacterial infections, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482370/"&gt;fungal infection &lt;em&gt;Pneumocystis jirovecii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that strikes the immunocompromised and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK563286/"&gt;the protozoan parasite &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One feature stood out: The man had developed elevated levels of eosinophils, white blood cells that can increase for various reasons—including parasitic infections. The man also had a reddish-purple rash over his abdomen. Coupled with the severity of his illness, Kotton suspected a widespread parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man's history was notable for contact with domestic cats and dogs—including a cat scratch in the time between having the transplant and falling critically ill. But common bacterial infections linked to cat scratches could be ruled out. And other parasitic infections that might come from domestic animals in the US, such as toxocariasis, don't typically lead to such critical illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

However, potassium is arguably just as important. In fact, research suggests that diets that are higher in potassium and lower in sodium can help lower blood pressure levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We spoke with a medical doctor and two registered dietitians to understand why potassium is the #1 nutrient to help reduce blood pressure.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290730/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-potassium-and-what-to-do-about-it/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Potassium&lt;/a&gt; and sodium work together to maintain fluid balance in the body, which affects blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; When the body is properly hydrated and these nutrients are consumed in adequate amounts, fluid levels remain balanced. However, problems arise when there’s an imbalance of sodium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When your body has more sodium than potassium, it increases your blood volume, causing more pressure on your blood vessels,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Melanie Betz, MS, RD, CSR, FAND&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Important for Kidney Function &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://www.nymc.edu/som/faculty/naidu-srihari-s.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Srihari S. Naidu, MD, FACC, FSCAI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://entirelynourished.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, MS, RD, CDE, CDN&lt;/a&gt;, another way potassium helps lower blood pressure is by increasing the excretion of sodium by the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-and-worst-foods-for-kidneys-8411479" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;kidneys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only is this important for lowering blood pressure, but it may also help reduce kidney damage. Over time, consistently high blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in and around the kidneys, making it harder for the kidneys to function properly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One of the functions impacted is the kidneys’ ability to remove excess sodium, making blood pressure more challenging to control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium helps the smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls relax, which eases tension and lowers resistance within the arteries. This relaxation allows blood to flow more freely, resulting in reduced blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, potassium helps keep blood vessels open by inhibiting angiotensin—a hormone produced in the liver and metabolized by the kidneys—that causes blood vessels to tighten.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy adults are recommended to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;consume 3,400 mg per day of potassium&lt;/a&gt; for men and 2,600 mg per day for women. For folks with high blood pressure, the American Heart Association recommends bumping intake up to 3,500 mg to 5,00 mg per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite the benefits of eating potassium, Naidu cautions that high potassium intake can be dangerous for certain folks, including some older adults, those with kidney disease and people on medications that can increase blood potassium levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to Naidu, high levels of potassium can also cause arrhythmias, where the heart's rhythm is out of sync. Before increasing your potassium intake, Naidu recommends talking with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;potassium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, bananas likely come to mind first. However, you may be surprised by just how many foods contain potassium. And this is good news as Betz and Routhenstein recommend meeting your potassium needs by eating a wide variety of foods. Here are a few examples of foods that are high or good sources of potassium:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Bananas and plantains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leafy greens, including beet greens and spinach &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White and sweet potatoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Winter squash, including acorn, butternut and pumpkins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carrots and parsnips &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beans, including lima and pinto &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tomatoes &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a potassium-rich diet is just one piece of the puzzle for better blood pressure Here are additional strategies to help lower your levels: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try the DASH diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Routhenstein recommends considering the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2054270/how-to-follow-the-dash-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet&lt;/a&gt;—an eating plan specifically designed to help lower blood pressure by limiting sodium intake and encouraging foods containing potassium, magnesium and calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Active: &lt;/strong&gt;According to Naidu, regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure and support overall heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For optimal health, it’s recommended to aim for 150 minutes of cardiovascular exercise per week and at least two strength-training sessions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Stress hormones—like cortisol—can cause your blood pressure to rise, especially during times of prolonged or chronic stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054352/6-fast-ways-to-lower-cortisol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lower cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt;—and blood pressure—find a few &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stress management techniques&lt;/a&gt; you can do regularly, such as journaling, yoga, meditation or going for a walk outside. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Alcohol and Avoid Smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-alcohol-does-to-your-body-8747903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/a&gt; can elevate the hormone renin, which causes blood vessels to constrict and blood pressure levels to rise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you choose to drink, do so in moderation: no more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men. Smoking is another major risk factor as it can cause your blood vessels to narrow and restrict blood flow.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Avoid smoking (if you haven’t started), or talk to your healthcare provider about ways to quit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Often overlooked, potassium is essential for healthy blood pressure. It helps maintain fluid balance, supports kidney health and relaxes smooth muscle in blood vessel walls. High potassium intake isn’t safe for everyone—especially those with kidney disease. However, for most healthy adults, it’s recommended to enjoy a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/11369/healthy-recipes-for-potassium-rich-foods/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;variety of potassium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as plantains, lima beans and dark leafy greens. In addition to enjoying more high-potassium foods, making other lifestyle changes, including managing sodium intake, following the DASH diet, staying active, reducing stress, limiting alcohol and avoiding smoking, can go a long way in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-healthy-blood-pressure-meal-plan-for-beginners-8724322" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supporting healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.

She was given six months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a decade later she is living a full and vibrant life - defying the odds in what doctors call a 'miracle' case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, she began experiencing headaches and seizures, prompting her to go to the hospital. Doctors found &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14408499/unusual-sign-cancer-decade-glioblastoma-brain-symptom.html"&gt;a tumor in her brainstem&lt;/a&gt;, called a glioma, a typically fatal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-03d25b20-4df1-11f0-890e-2ff2c2bfa2b3"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; with minimal treatment options that are often unsuccessful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said she had about six months to live until the cancer, which has a survival rate of about eight percent, killed her.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wethor said: ‘Because my tumor is so difficult to treat, I was able to leave the hospital and spend my "last six months" doing what I love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During those first six months, when I thought they might be my last, I made it a mission to do something creative every single day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She painted, taught herself how to play guitar, and made fashion a form of self-expression. She visited museums with her mother, which she said 'was crucial to keeping my mind off my diagnosis and current health circumstances.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she never received treatment, her symptoms – &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14808807/brain-cancer-perimenopause-symptom-sign.html"&gt;headaches, fatigue, and seizures&lt;/a&gt; – became manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Ten years ago, doctors discovered a tumor in her brainstem—a usually fatal cancer. Yet Wethor has beaten the odds, living a vibrant life full of adventure and creativity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s not always perfect, but I’ve found ways to work with my body rather than against it,’ she said. ‘Most days, I’m able to live a full and relatively normal life…I don’t assume I have time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, an advocate for cancer research, Wethor undergoes MRI scans, fearing all the time that the cancer has grown. But she hasn't let that fear take over her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A glioma of the brain stem is a tumor that develops in the area connecting the brain to the spinal cord and can come in different varieties based on the specific type of glial cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brainstem is crucial in controlling vital functions such as breathing, heart rate, swallowing, and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Damage to it can lead to a wide range of devastating effects that Wethor fears are lurking just around the corner, including difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brainstem gliomas are rare and more common in children than adults. Every year, there are roughly 300 cases in adults and 500 cases in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the same cancer President Joe Biden's son Beau had. He was diagnosed in 2013 and died two years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My doctors can’t explain why I have survived,’ she said. ‘I still have my tumor, but miraculously, it has not grown.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no treatment for this form of cancer, leaving her wondering when her regular MRI scan will show that the tumor has grown and pressure on her brain has worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors do not know what prompted the tumor to develop, how it might respond to treatment, what the best available treatments are, or whether it will come back if a patient reaches remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Grace Wethor in 2020. While not in treatment, her symptoms – headaches, fatigue, and seizures – are manageable with a healthy balance of mindfulness and physical health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;‘The hope is that one day a trial or new treatment will emerge that can help tumors in this area of the brain,’ she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But research suggests that a simple measure you can do at home is highly predictive of longevity. It’s known as your grip strength, and it measures the force or pressure your hand exerts when squeezing or holding an object. Grip strength can be measured in a doctor’s office, or you can pick up a device called a hand grip dynamometer (like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handeful-Dynamometer-Measurement-Electronic-Strengthener/dp/B08X4JQDJZ/ref=sr_1_5?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.65125207%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;) to check it at home on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://mdmercy.com/find-a-doctor/clayton-alexander-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clayton Alexander, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clayton Alexander, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, orthopedic surgeon and hand specialist at Mercy Medical Center; &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/alfred-tallia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alfred F.

But doctors say there is something to grip strength and indicating a healthy, long life. Here’s what the study found, plus what doctors want you to keep in mind when using this as a measurement of your health status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed data from more than 12,000 adults aged 50 and older for 12 years. The researchers used handgrip dynamometry measurements to track grip strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people with weaker grip strengths had a 45% higher risk of dying during the study period than those with stronger grips. The researchers concluded that grip strength provides a “robust prediction of time to mortality” and suggests that healthcare providers encourage people to do strength training as they get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Muscle health is part of overall health, and longevity is a significant health outcome,” says &lt;a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/hnes/faculty_and_staff/ryan_mcgrath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ryan McGrath., Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Ryan McGrath., Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author and associate professor in the department of Health, Nutrition, and Exercise Sciences at North Dakota State University. “Understanding how aspects of muscle health, such as strength, may connect with health outcomes is important for informing relevant programs and lifespan health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might grip strength be linked to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a new concept, and, in fact, doctors usually test grip strength during check-ups as people get older or if they’re getting ready for surgery. “It’s part of the measure of frailty,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/199050-david-m-cutler" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Cutler, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Cutler, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. “We use frailty as a measurement all the time to assess someone’s risk for surgery and health status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength has emerged as an indicator of total body muscle mass and strength, explains &lt;a href="https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=ns1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nikhil Satchidanand, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nikhil Satchidanand, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist and assistant professor in the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Division of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine. “It is not just a measure of muscle power but also helps us understand the general health of our skeletal muscles,” he says. “In clinical and research settings, grip strength is used as a non-invasive, easy, and cost-effective way to gather information about an individual’s overall health and function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good grip strength is also crucial for survival, points out &lt;a href="https://rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/alfred-tallia" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alfred F. Tallia, M.D., M.P.H.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alfred F. Tallia, M.D., M.P.H.&lt;/a&gt;, professor and chair of family medicine and community health at the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. “The ability to grasp things is an essential part of our daily lives that touches our success at all activities of daily living—feeding, bathing, clothing ourselves, ambulating, and movement,” he says. “So it is not at all surprising that a decline in grip strength is correlated with prediction of impending death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for improving grip strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all of that, grip strength isn’t the end-all, be-all for longevity. In fact, Dr. Cutler points out that it’s “just one of several measures” doctors use to look at a person’s health status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know that it’s the grip strength that leads to a longer life, and we don’t know if it will improve their longevity, but we can use measurements that include both grip strength and other standard frailty measurements,” Dr. Cutler says. (Those include things like whether someone has multiple underlying health conditions and if they’ve lost significant weight lately with no explanation, he says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you want to improve your grip strength, there are things you can do. “You can improve grip strength by using a grip strength trainer, but just because you do so does not mean you can reduce mortality,” Dr. Alexander says. (It just may mean that you’ll be better at opening jars or grasping weights.) You can also try repeatedly squeezing a ball, McGrath says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts stress that your grip strength can only tell so much about how long you’ll live. “Grip strength loss is just a marker of frailty—it is not the cause of mortality,” Dr. Alexander says. If you’re concerned that your grip isn’t strong, McGrath says you can work on it. But you’re worried about your overall health, he recommends focusing on physical activity and eating a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 16:18:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9kTHdnYjExMnJBWURxeTN2WWl0NGlxOENpMVZGRVZQMlcwaDhVcURCNjZ6RHY1R3EyTFJkWWYxZjJ6SGg0NTNRN28zVHhBdUZXdHFhdFNQajcyQmFjX1JUMWRkeUM2QlZtbkN2N3FB</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，排名第一的低估食物可以增加您的镁摄入量- EatingWell | The #1 Underrated Food to Increase Your Magnesium Intake, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxNcnhiRE16VFBFbm45ZjhwLWZXY252SW55Q2tmRmNIb1VyU0xTMnRxTFJGZFJPTGE1c1JRcS1LbkFYdm1MM21Mb09pbEZfS1hvRmItVUpTWHQyX0IwbEhKd0hJOFFBcHJoQXh6MWE1bVpFazlwVGRfTGFZYU1QVkNiMWV2eDVUWEctTUQyZDJnZVhlVVBqR0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adequate magnesium intake supports a healthy heart, better sleep and good digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are an excellent source of magnesium. They also offer fiber, protein and omega-3 fatty acids. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can enjoy chia seeds in so many ways, including overnight oats, chia pudding and jam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium doesn’t receive as much airtime as other nutrients (like protein), yet it’s so important for maintaining our whole-body health. The mineral helps with heart and nerve function, blood pressure, blood sugar regulation, strong bones and energy production. “Magnesium is a mineral your body needs to help over 300 little ‘helper’ proteins (called enzymes) do their jobs,” says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When magnesium levels are low, your first symptoms may include muscle cramps, fatigue or poor sleep, says Imus.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not eating enough &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-metabolic-syndrome-11736662" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds and whole grains, you’re probably low in this mineral. Let’s zero in on seeds as a source of magnesium: Dietitians say &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dangers-of-chia-seeds-11717491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, are a simple, underrated way to add more magnesium to your day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One ounce (about 2 tablespoons) of chia seeds offers 95 milligrams of magnesium, which provides 23% of your Daily Value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That same 1-ounce serving has &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7959854/ways-to-add-5-grams-of-fiber-to-your-meals/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;10 grams of fiber&lt;/a&gt; (!), 5 grams of the omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and 5 grams of protein. Chia seeds also offer B vitamins and are a source of a number of antioxidants, including chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, kaempferol and quercetin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds provide magnesium and fiber, both of which are essential for maintaining a healthy digestive system. For starters, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium may help promote&lt;/a&gt; the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut.  These bacteria work to improve the gut barrier’s function and balance the microbiome, Imus says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only that, but magnesium may also help regulate bowel movements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Two tablespoons of chia seeds pack an impressive 35% of your fiber needs. Eating more fiber helps with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-before-in-the-morning-to-help-you-poop-11718405" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestion regularity&lt;/a&gt; so that you’re going to the bathroom consistently (and easily)—just make sure to drink plenty of water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The ample amount of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-11740104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, fiber and omega-3 fats found in chia seeds also supports a healthy heart. Chia seeds may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lower-triglycerides-mistakes-11742759" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lowering triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt;, while also raising HDL cholesterol.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds, especially ground chia seeds, can increase levels of omega-3 fatty acids in the blood, which can help fight heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In turn, low magnesium levels have been linked to issues like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906963/sneaky-reasons-blood-pressure-is-high-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and irregular heartbeat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not sleeping well, it could be a sign your body needs more magnesium, says &lt;a href="https://sproutoutloud.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ali McGowan, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;: “Chia seeds are a small, easy step to help fill that gap.” Observational studies have found that low magnesium intake may be linked to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8076313/magnesium-for-sleep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; like snoring, short sleep duration and daytime sleepiness.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, emerging research has found that omega-3 fatty acids may also improve how well you sleep.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds have a slight earthy taste, but otherwise, they don’t have much flavor. This means chia seeds can easily be added to many dishes and recipes to add thickness while also boosting the nutritional offerings. “I love adding chia seeds to overnight oats, blending them into smoothies for extra thickness, or making a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cinnamon-roll-oatmeal-8690614" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;quick pudding with milk, cinnamon and vanilla&lt;/a&gt;,” says McGowan.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add to oats: &lt;/strong&gt;Add fun texture and thickness to your overnight oats recipe. You can add chia seeds ground or whole, just make sure to add more liquid for the seeds to soak up, or else your breakfast may be dry. The &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-high-protein-high-fiber-meal-plan-for-weight-loss-11736989" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber and protein combo&lt;/a&gt; from chia seeds will give you more staying power (i.e., you’ll feel fuller longer) throughout the morning.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make chia pudding: &lt;/strong&gt;Chia pudding couldn’t be easier to pull together. Just combine chia seeds with your choice of liquid (milk and plant-based milks work well) and voilà, chia pudding. Adding flavors like vanilla, ground cinnamon, honey or maple syrup will take your pudding up a notch. Or try our go-to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Chia Seed Pudding&lt;/a&gt; recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create your own jam: &lt;/strong&gt;Store-bought jam can be high in added sugar and low in nutrients, so consider making your own with chia seeds. It’s as simple as combining a fruit of your choice—frozen berries work well—with chia seeds.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Imus also reminds us not to overdo it. ​​“Chia seeds absorb a lot of water, and too much may lead to constipation or bloating.” Starting with 1 to 2 tablespoons is a reasonable amount.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds make for a great way to up your intake of magnesium. Two tablespoons of chia seeds provide about a quarter of our daily needs, which helps support a healthy heart, better sleep and good digestion. Try adding the seeds to overnight oats, smoothies, yogurt or toast for a boost in not only magnesium, but also omega-3 fatty acids, fiber and protein.

&lt;p&gt;Some oral bacteria and related virulence factors, such as molecules that help bacteria colonize the body — many of which can trigger a potent inflammatory response — were significantly enriched in the guts of Parkinson’s patients with cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that promoting a healthy microbiome through consistent oral care, a balanced diet, and potentially targeted probiotic interventions could support improved disease management in Parkinson’s,” Saeed Shoaie, PhD, the study’s lead at King’s College London in the U.K., said in a &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/mouth-and-gut-bacteria-linked-to-brain-changes-in-parkinsons-disease"&gt;university news story&lt;/a&gt;. The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19490976.2025.2506843#abstract"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microbiome signatures of virulence in the oral-gut-brain axis influence Parkinson’s disease and cognitive decline pathophysiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with Parkinson’s can have a range of &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/non-motor/"&gt;nonmotor symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including gastrointestinal problems such as constipation or nausea, in the years before &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; appear. Changes in the gut may play a role in Parkinson’s development via the communication system between the gut and the brain, called the gut-brain axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the oral health of Parkinson’s patients also impacts the course of their disease, the contribution of mouth bacteria has been largely overlooked. In fact, &lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, a well-studied oral bacterium, has been found in the brain of people with &lt;a href="https://alzheimersnewstoday.com/approved-treatments-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, and active gum disease, or periodontitis, has been reported to impact cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The human gut and oral bacterial communities are increasingly linked to neurodegenerative diseases,” Shoaie said. “Disruptions in the gut-brain axis could trigger inflammation and immune responses that contribute to neuronal damage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Gut, oral microbiome effect on cognition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined gut and mouth bacteria collected from the stool and saliva samples of Parkinson’s patients with mild cognitive decline and dementia to explore the role of gut and oral microbiomes on cognitive impairment. A group of healthy people served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s patients with dementia had significantly less gut microbiome diversity than those with mild cognitive impairment. There was also a decrease in microbial diversity and the metagenomic species richness, or the total number of different species within a microbial community, in the oral microbiome of those with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a species analysis, there was a limited number of overlapping bacterial species across all three groups, meaning many species were uniquely enriched or depleted in patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This suggests “these microbial changes are likely associated with [cognitive impairment],” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a predictive assessment, the changes in microbial species were sensitive enough to differentiate between Parkinson’s patients with varying clinical features, and adding data like age and sex significantly improved the predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don’t yet know if the bacteria are causing the cognitive decline or if changes in the body due to Parkinson’s allow these bacteria to grow,” said Frederick Clasen, PhD, the study’s first author and research associate at King’s College London. “But our findings suggest they may play an active role in worsening symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When oral bacteria move to the gut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers then investigated so-called oral-gut translocation, wherein oral bacteria move into the gut, where they don’t usually live. Data showed the guts of patients with dementia were significantly enriched with mouth bacteria. Moreover, those with cognitive impairment or dementia had significantly higher levels of oral-specific virulence factors in the gut, that is, molecules that help the bacterium colonize the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identified virulence factors had various functions, including stress, immune modulation, adherence, biofilm formation, invasion, and metabolism. Some are important for bacteria to infect cells that line the blood vessels in the brain. At the same time, several other factors related to immune modulation were involved in producing LPS, a molecule on bacterial surfaces that triggers inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These toxins could be used as biological markers to identify patients at higher risk of dementia in Parkinson’s,” Clasen said. “In the future, they might also be targets for new treatments that protect the brain by changing the gut environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also saw a drop in several types of bacteria in the mouth of patients with dementia or cognitive impairment compared with healthy people, which could suggest a loss of healthy bacterial balance, making it easier for harmful bacteria to take over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides compelling evidence that the interplay between oral and gut microbiomes significantly influences [Parkinson’s] and [cognitive impairment],” the researcher wrote. “The translocation of oral microbial species to the gut, along with their associated [virulence factors], highlights new avenues for understanding disease mechanisms and developing potential biomarkers and therapeutic avenues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoaie said the “emerging evidence underscores the potential importance of maintaining oral and gut health in mitigating or slowing neurodegenerative processes. As people with Parkinson’s become increasingly reliant on carers, routine practices such as oral hygiene and nutritional intake may be neglected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Parkinson's News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:38:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxQVVlpYWVoX2dUdmJrSFJlcF9kRlB4MU1reHNELUw0ZDZXMEVzblVBTnp1LWhmM1diaUJXMzBvSDZQRjZfSjRfZ3V0eEJZd241b0hUdE9yRlFZMnRCNjU5YlRiZ25yblBydlVUNmxOX0FaWjhYQlRhWXhaYVpnRmZWYWh5SnZGSEZ0bXZKeDRXV1FPNVR0T290ZW1zcGZ1Y3Z0TXc</guid></item><item><title>首次显示的慢性疲劳综合征如何影响患者血液的量表- Medical Xpress | Scale of how chronic fatigue syndrome affects patients' blood shown for first time - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQb0FZZjFqNjJ6UVJkeGpHRkR4VUZka1hrVEgwRzIyMTJpY09CWndfa2YtRW5VcGlxeFY1cWtsOVVPV1FnYjBPYWtSR1JoZXVzRGlpaGxCTUpITjlxQi1TLWZuZ1NDaEIySEc4Y1Z4Z0J4OXZ5ZEhZMkVPdVZoTzJ4VDRoZUZxZnpPSkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with ME/CFS (myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) have significant differences in their blood compared with healthy individuals, a new study reveals, suggesting a path toward more reliable diagnosis of the long-term debilitating illness. The paper is &lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00258-8" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The largest ever biological study of ME/CFS has identified consistent blood differences associated with chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, and liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significantly, the results were mostly unaffected by patients' activity levels, as low activity levels can sometimes hide the biological signs of illness, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume and consistency of the blood differences support the long-term goal of developing a blood test to help diagnose ME/CFS, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ME/CFS' key feature, called post-exertional malaise, is a delayed dramatic worsening of symptoms following minor physical effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other symptoms include pain, brain fog and extreme energy limitation that does not improve with rest. Causes are unknown and there is currently no diagnostic test or cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Genetics and Cancer worked with researchers from the Schools of Mathematics and Informatics to better understand the biology that underpins the condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They used data from the UK Biobank—a health database of over half a million people—to compare 1,455 ME/CFS patients with 131,000 healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They examined more than 3,000 blood-based biomarkers and used advanced models to account for differences associated with age, sex, and activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results, which were replicated afterwards using data from the US, showed that hundreds of biomarkers differed between ME/CFS patients and healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Some 116 significant differences were found in both men and women, a key finding as ME/CFS can affect sexes differently. The consistent results across both groups strengthens the reliability of the biomarkers, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strongest biomarker differences were found in people who reported symptoms consistent with post-exertional malaise, highlighting its central role in the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe these &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biomarker/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biomarker&lt;/a&gt; changes are more likely a result of ME/CFS, rather than the initial trigger of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Chris Ponting, of the MRC Human Genetics Unit at the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Genetics and Cancer, said, "For so long, people with ME/CFS have been told it's all in their head. It's not: we see people's ME/CFS in their blood. Evidence that there is a large number of replicated and diverse blood biomarkers that differentiate between ME/CFS cases and controls should now dispel any lingering perception that ME/CFS is caused by deconditioning and exercise intolerance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sjoerd Beentjes, of the School of Mathematics, said, "Blood differences are sometimes attributed to reduced activity levels, rather than ME/CFS directly. By applying very recent advances in the statistical and causal inference literature, our study provides strong evidence that ME/CFS affects blood traits through paths other than activity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ava Khamseh, of the School of Informatics, said, "This work has been an exciting cross-disciplinary and collaborative effort to integrate mathematical statistics, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/machine+learning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; and biomedical expertise from across the University to answer a challenged-led question for ME/CFS research."&lt;/p&gt;

The energy they produce is critical in the brain as this organ consumes roughly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8364152/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;20 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the body’s resting energy budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, no one had measured how these organelles are arranged across the brain in three dimensions, which left a gap between the knowledge of cellular biology and the understanding of mental feats that rise or fall with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-energy-from-brain-mitochondria-matters"&gt;Why energy from brain mitochondria matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biology of the brain, we know now, is deeply intertwined with the energetics of the brain,” said &lt;a href="https://www.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; psychobiologist &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/martin-picard-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Martin Picard&lt;/a&gt;, a co‑author of the new work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard and an international team built the &lt;a href="http://humanmitobrainmap.bcblab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MitoBrainMap&lt;/a&gt; from 703 match‑head‑sized samples taken from the donated brain of a 54‑year‑old man who died of a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists profiled &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553192/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;oxidative phosphorylation&lt;/a&gt; capacity, mitochondrial DNA copies, and organelle volume in every cube, then trained a model that predicts energy traits for the rest of the brain with MRI‑level resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cutting-the-brain-into-cubes"&gt;Cutting the brain into cubes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each 0.12‑inch (3 millimeter) cube matched the smallest unit a hospital scanner can currently resolve, thereby bridging lab assays with clinical images. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handling nearly seven hundred samples demanded robotic slicing, automated biochemistry, and hefty computing power, yet the approach preserved regional context that test‑tube studies lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once trained, the model reconstructed a whole‑&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-use-storage-trick-to-keep-your-memories-in-sequential-order/"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; atlas that can overlay standard neuroimages, letting clinicians see where energy shortfalls align with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-old-brain-regions-had-fewest-mitochondria"&gt;Old brain regions had fewest mitochondria &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolutionarily ancient areas such as the brainstem and basal ganglia showed the sparsest mitochondrial coverage, indicating the lowest production of energy for brain cells. More recently evolved cortical folds, in comparison, brimmed with high‑output organelles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://valentinriedl.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valentin Riedl&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the project, called the feat “technically impressive and conceptually groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gradient matches behavioral observations: functions like balance and breathing endure late into life, whereas problem‑solving and working memory (tasks seated in newer cortical regions) fade first when energy falters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evolutionary-changes-in-brain-mitochondria-functions"&gt;Evolutionary changes in brain mitochondria functions &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings align with evolutionary &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7617105/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;theories&lt;/a&gt; suggesting that more recently developed brain regions evolved to support complex tasks like language, planning, and abstract thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-is-constantly-making-predictions-about-the-world-and-your-place-in-reality/"&gt;functions &lt;/a&gt;require more energy, which explains why newer cortical areas are packed with higher-density and more efficient mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, older brain structures responsible for survival functions like breathing or heart rate regulation operate on lower energy demands. This evolutionary layering may help explain why certain cognitive abilities are more vulnerable to aging and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-gray-and-white-matter"&gt;Lessons from gray and white matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553239/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gray matter&lt;/a&gt; in the brain packed about fifty percent more mitochondria than &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abf3736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt;, and those mitochondria also generated energy with greater efficiency. That finding echoes earlier &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11024075/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; showing that the density of mitochondrial complex I correlates with IQ and processing speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because gray matter handles local computation while white matter relays long‑range signals, the split hints that thinking depends not just on how many mitochondria exist but also on how well they convert fuel into &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31985968/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt;, the cell’s energy currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linking-energy-to-mental-performance"&gt;Linking energy to mental performance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10526226/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that mitochondrial health strongly influences learning, attention, and emotional regulation. These traits rely on fast, flexible neural circuits that are especially sensitive to energy shortfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regions like the prefrontal cortex, essential for decision-making and working memory, demand high levels of ATP to function properly. When mitochondria falter in these areas, even minor deficits can ripple outward into daily thinking and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signals-for-aging-brains"&gt;Signals for aging brains&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dysfunction of brain mitochondria is increasingly viewed as a driver of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39877373/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodegenerative disorders&lt;/a&gt;; recent reviews tie impaired organelle dynamics to amyloid and tau build‑up in Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317673121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; from Picard’s lab links psychosocial stress to shifts in the biology of brain mitochondria, suggesting lifestyle and environment may tweak the energetic landscape long before plaques appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By pinpointing where energy production runs thin, the new map could steer drug and behavioral trials toward the regions most likely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toward-personalized-energy-profiles"&gt;Toward personalized energy profiles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early data hint that individual lifestyles (diet, sleep patterns, exercise) may leave distinct marks on each person’s brain energy map. Tracking those differences could guide tailored interventions long before clinical symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the MitoBrainMap with wearable health trackers may reveal how daily habits shift brain mitochondrial performance in real time. That fusion of lab-grade &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/"&gt;precision&lt;/a&gt; and personal monitoring opens the door to truly preventive brain care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has already begun cataloging nine key regions in 500 additional brains to gauge variation across sex, ancestry, and disease history. If the patterns hold, future MRI scans may include an energy overlay that predicts who is at risk for memory lapses, years before they first arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08740-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 15:07:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPTFV3aVRaUTJxcTFjY3lsS01tdlY3UERBak05X0J0NUhiRnVWNHF3Tk1LQTc5ZG9ESGpOeE90VUVhYUlzenF6ZFdINVhBTFRhM011cjBFaVhyOVFRZnViUDVQRVVFdV95Ym1JWUd5ZmcwMmg1VE91LXNuRmpTN1Rnenp3RzdzdV9taW4waXF0cFJ3N2dnZUhOMUd3</guid></item><item><title>医生如何为RFK Jr.的疫苗政策转变做准备-第19期新闻 | How doctors are preparing for RFK Jr.’s shifts on vaccine policy - The 19th News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1jbjI5V0NDZldwOTlJQVlraEhaLUxMU3hMU050Z2M5cVdxZ2FGTDhDeERJdEo1ZE8tcG1rNlp2RnpvTmpmYUIwcXM2ZWl5cVI2c2xQeWliTDE1cWlnUnR4c3ZVZ1VmcFpPZ3c0Qjk0NlphRkhzSUY4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gutenberg article-body-width js-hang-punc"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        
                  
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to vaccines, there are two kinds of parents coming into Dr. Megan Prior’s office in Washington, D.C., these days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One set are parents who pepper the pediatrician with increasingly panicked questions about the future availability of vaccines and whether their children can get any shots early. Then there are the parents who feel vindicated in their decision not to vaccinate their kids, &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Weighing-the-Risks-and-Benefits.aspx"&gt;despite vaccines’ overall safety and record of disease prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s almost like I have these two groups of diverging patients, where some are really, really worried about their access and want to get things done as soon as possible,” she said. “And then others are sort of in this vaccine hesitant category.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  
      
  




&lt;p&gt;Both groups have been spurred by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s HHS shakeups could have huge implications for vaccine policy in America. Earlier this month, he fired all 17 members of a key vaccine panel and replaced them with a smaller group of people who in some cases &lt;a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/06/rfk-jr-fires-vaccine-panel-replacements/"&gt;lack relevant experience and who, like him, have been skeptical of vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; the vaccine panel firings were aimed at addressing members’ conflicts of interest, even though they worked under &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/ACIP-conflicts-interest-policy.pdf"&gt;a comprehensive policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Physicians who treat both children and families say they’re frustrated with Kennedy’s unprecedented firing of the panel known as the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) — and they’re concerned about what it might mean for the future availability of safe and effective vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For now, doctors are figuring out as a medical community how they can keep their patients healthy with evidence-based guidelines. They’re turning to each other — through membership in trusted organizations that are taking joint actions — and figuring out how to give patients reliable information amid uncertainty about the government’s next steps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP’s review of vaccines and subsequent guidance, under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helps insurance companies determine vaccine coverage. A change to ACIP recommendations could have the ripple effect of making a vaccine more expensive to obtain, or more difficult to access through doctors’ offices and pharmacies. The new panel has not taken any actions yet, but its members are scheduled to next week. Vaccine experts say they’re watching closely to see what policy changes, if any, might emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I were a mom, and I’m thinking, ‘What do I do for my kid right now?’ I want to be confident that my primary care physician, my family doctor or my pediatrician was making recommendations based on what we know from science and not based on what the insurance company will or will not pay for, or what politics is saying,” said Dr. Jen Brull, a longtime family physician who is now president of &lt;a href="https://www.aafp.org/home.html"&gt;the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)&lt;/a&gt;. “I think it’s very safe to say that you can look to your primary care physician for that kind of recommendation, and that’s what you should be looking for.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior, who has long used ACIP and CDC guidance on vaccines to answer questions from parents, said she recently downloaded a version of the current children’s vaccination schedule that includes recommendations made by the fired vaccine panel, “just in case there are any changes, so I can remember exactly how wording looked.” She is creating a list of trusted sources, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKC2kT9HsmA"&gt;the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)&lt;/a&gt; and AAFP, so she can monitor how they mirror or pivot from future government actions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other vaccine experts have announced their &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/cidrap-launches-vaccine-integrity-project"&gt;own initiative&lt;/a&gt; to protect the integrity of vaccine policy, information and access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Clearly, there’s a lot of us who are super interested in evidence-based science that will ensure that physicians and families have access to the right recommendations, no matter how politicized things get,” Prior said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Around the same time that news about Kennedy’s ACIP firings broke, hundreds of doctors were gathered in Chicago for a key meeting of &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/"&gt;the American Medical Association (AMA)&lt;/a&gt;, the largest association of physicians, representing more than 190 state and specialty medical societies. Within hours after the firings were public, Brull and representatives from several major medical groups drafted an &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/a25-emergency-1001.pdf"&gt;emergency resolution&lt;/a&gt; that called on Kennedy to reverse his actions on the vaccine panel and also requested a Senate investigation into the firings. The resolution passed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The emotion in the room was that everyone who was there cared about this — but we wanted to make sure that the AMA, that our individual organizations, were speaking truth,” Brull said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and spokesperson for AAP, said the recent dismantling of expertise on ACIP threatens a clarity that has developed over decades within the medical community when it comes to vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AAP has been issuing vaccine guidance since 1935, nearly three decades before ACIP was created. To help reduce confusion, both entities officially began publishing harmonized guidance on vaccines in 1995. The consistency helped streamline care for families and reduced discrepancies as combination vaccines became more widely available, according to Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AAP still maintains its own expert review process for its vaccine schedule, and Higgins said the organization plans to keep issuing recommendations that are “grounded in science and committed to child health.” He worries about potentially conflicting recommendations in the future, and how that might raise public confusion and distrust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Parents we talk with are understandably anxious and unsure,” he said in an email. “Our parents and families have a lot of questions, and as pediatricians, we welcome those questions. Pediatricians want to partner with parents and meet them where they are with compassion, clarity, and credible information.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brull also wanted to emphasize that point from the lens of family physicians, who sometimes see generations of one family and can be a key source of evidence-based medical information, especially in rural areas with more limited health coverage options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“My foundational advice to parents and kids who are old enough to have these conversations on their own is that the best thing most people can do is reach out and talk to their primary care doctor — whether that’s their pediatrician or their family physician, and have a conversation,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ittybittyrevolution/reels/"&gt;who shares her views on health policy news on social media&lt;/a&gt;, does not want to minimize the implications of ACIP’s new membership and what it could mean if they pull a safe vaccine from the immunization schedules for adults or children. She still distinctly remembers her constant worry about whether her young child could access a COVID-19 vaccine, and the transition to in-person schooling and re-entering more public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we live in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/"&gt;measles is incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/national-international/whooping-cough-pertussis-post-pandemic-pediatrician-vaccination/3759327/"&gt;whooping cough is incredibly common&lt;/a&gt;, where these really infectious diseases are just part of our lives again, parents will have to go through those decisions again,” she said. “I think that piece of it makes me so frustrated. I know how frustrating it was to be a parent in COVID, and I do not wish that stress on anyone. It’s doubly frustrating that this stress we would be putting on ourselves is 100 percent preventable.”&lt;/p&gt;

But the pain grew so severe that he went to the emergency room, where scans discovered that the 40-year-old dad had concerning growths on his liver, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14824269/Father-four-dies-bowel-cancer-sign-dismiss.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Ingram-Baldwin / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Kyle Ingram-Baldwin, 40, died eight months after his colon cancer diagnosis.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further tests confirmed that these were cancerous growths. Then Kyle, who hailed from the English county of Kent, was given the devastating news that he had &lt;a href="https://people.com/jeff-ross-doctor-delivered-joke-with-colon-cancer-diagnosis-11757855" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; which had metastasized throughout his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was thinking, what's going on here? What have I done wrong? I was putting the blame on my own feet and worrying about the future for my wife and kids,” the dad, who shared four children, aged 12, 9, 3, and 1, with his wife Becky, said before his passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That's probably the hardest thing: the mental side. Don't get me wrong, the physical is not funny either, but it's a mental challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He underwent chemotherapy, but it failed to halt the spread of the cancer. Once &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-25-shocking-colon-cancer-diagnosis-hours-before-turned-fatal-8788944" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colon cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; has metastasized, the prognosis is grim, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society &lt;/a&gt;explains, with patients having a 13% chance of surviving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly before his death, Kyle said, “It's really hard to put into words, because I love my kids so much. You just worry about their future. They've got the best mum in the world, and I genuinely mean that. My wife's incredible.”'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Ingram-Baldwin / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Kyle Ingram-Baldwin with his wife, Becky.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family launched a fundraiser on June 8 to pay for alternative treatments, as he said he was “not prepared to give up” — but 8 days later, on June 16, Becky shared that “Kyle took a very sudden and unexpected turn and we lost him yesterday. He was the most incredible man I have ever met, and I know he would want me to thank everyone for all your sharing and donations,” which she said would be returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before his death, he urged people to seek medical care “If you think anything's wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Go get it checked,” he said. “I genuinely wouldn't want anyone being in my position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/dad-of-40-dies-8-months-persistent-stomach-ache-colon-cancer-11758235" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:58:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9zWW83Vk81ZHItNVp5YUpDX3ByajZGRG9TVmlPc05QcEFuVmR2ekEwMEp5N1RxTkRfLTg0c1FjbEZYcWZFamVQVXpySlVwTXRUU2kySUpJODVWYzZqTG1ZMzAtb1lmdXU5NVhnMXlB</guid></item><item><title>令人不安的案例将电子烟与侵袭性肺癌联系起来- Gizmodo | Troubling Case Links Vaping to Aggressive Lung Cancer - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPOFdzVVBvR0FXY2Z5YWZLaXJ6c2JHVDZtTE5aUVZ5b3lqYk1lUF9XRER2TzRCNEZ5eE9PQURGTmZSbTEzSGNOWWZiQTZjZnVSWFhrSmdjQjdIX3FKRHVHdDROdVVHbTdaTXBfSGpZYkZZSUVPcHdYYnZXbVQ0RGo1MTZCMU91eE12TlZCVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Vaping might be safer than cigarette smoking, but they carry their own health risks. A New Jersey man’s electronic cigarette habit likely contributed to his fast-spreading, fatal lung cancer, his doctors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City &lt;a href="https://amjcaserep.com/abstract/index/idArt/947911"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; the tragic death this month in the American Journal of Case Reports. The 51-year-old former smoker and longtime vaper developed an aggressive lung cancer that killed him just months after diagnosis. Though a causative link isn’t confirmed, the authors say more studies are needed to figure out vaping’s cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the man visited a local hospital sometime in 2020 after he started to cough up blood. During the prior month, he had also been experiencing symptoms of weight loss, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath. Tests soon revealed that he had a form of non-small cell lung carcinoma, specifically determined to be squamous cell carcinoma. The cancer had already started to spread and break off into pieces that reached the heart, making surgery unfeasible. He was discharged and quickly placed on chemotherapy, but to no avail. The man’s health continued to rapidly deteriorate and he died three months after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man had a history of cigarette smoking, the equivalent of 10 pack-years (meaning he smoked roughly a pack a day for 10 years). But he told the doctors he quit in 2009 and switched exclusively to e-cigarettes for the next 11 years. He regularly received lung and heart check-ups, and his last chest X-ray two years earlier was normal, suggesting his cancer only recently emerged. Because of the aggressive and non-responsive nature of the cancer, his relatively young age (most cases are caught in people over 65) and the lack of recent cigarette use, the doctors suspect that vaping probably played a part in his death.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“While causality cannot be established, the case highlights a potential association between [vaping] and malignancy,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People have gotten seriously sick from vaping before, though usually under specific circumstances. In 2019, for instance, a mysterious lung disease that affected thousands of people in the U.S. was ultimately &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-ever-happened-to-the-vaping-lung-disease-1845750495"&gt;traced back&lt;/a&gt; to toxic additives primarily used in THC-containing vapes (while the initial outbreak did subside, these cases still &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/woman-hospitalized-with-covid-19-was-actually-suffering-1847362336"&gt;appear&lt;/a&gt; occasionally). Other chemicals used to flavor vapes have also &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/popcorn-lung-how-vaping-could-scar-your-lungs-for-life/"&gt;been tied&lt;/a&gt; to rare lung illnesses. But this appears to be one of the first case reports to explicitly link vaping and lung cancer. Other &lt;a href="https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/oral-carcinoma-associated-with-chronic-use-of-electronic-cigarettes-2161-119X-1000304.php?aid=88343"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33926987/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; have found a connection between vaping and mouth cancer. Some studies have also suggested that people who both vape and smoke (so-called dual users) have a &lt;a href="https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/vaping-smoking-and-lung-cancer-risk"&gt;higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of lung cancer than people who only smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, the overall research to date doesn’t appear to &lt;a href="https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/Evidence-update-on-the-cancer-risk-of-vaping-e-cigarettes-A-systematic-review,192934,0,2.html#:~:text=No%20significant%20incident%20or%20prevalent%20risk%20of%20lung%20cancer%20or%20other%20types%20of%20cancer%20was%20found%20in%20the%20never%20smoker%20current%20vapers%20population."&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; a significant added risk of lung cancer among people who only vape and have never smoked. And studies have also long found that vaping is &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/ready-to-quit-smoking/vaping-to-quit-smoking/vaping-myths-and-the-facts/#:~:text=Myth%201%3A%20Vaping%20is%20just%20as%20harmful%20as%20smoking&amp;amp;text=Nicotine%20vaping%20is%20not%20risk,of%20the%20risks%20of%20smoking%22."&gt;less harmful&lt;/a&gt; in general than smoking. Given that this case is only one anecdote, the doctors aren’t pushing for formal changes to screening guidelines just yet. But they are calling for further studies to untangle the unique dangers that vaping may pose.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

These symptoms, which can include exhaustion, difficulty concentrating, and muscle weakness, often begin within minutes to hours after orgasm and can persist for several days. Although the condition has been largely observed in men, there is growing, albeit limited, evidence that it may also affect women. A new scientific review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Sexuality &amp;amp; Culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers the most up-to-date summary of what is currently known about POIS, highlighting its symptoms, possible causes, and a wide range of treatment attempts—none of which has proven universally effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers conducted the review because POIS remains an under-recognized condition with no established diagnostic criteria in medical manuals and no agreed-upon treatment approach. Since it was first described in 2002, only a handful of studies have attempted to systematically explore its causes and potential treatments. The review authors aimed to provide a clearer overview of the scientific literature to help both clinicians and patients better understand the condition and guide future research efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To carry out the review, the authors searched the PubMed database for articles with references to POIS in their titles, abstracts, or keywords. This initial search produced 429 results, which were then narrowed down to English-language studies published between 2020 and 2025. After removing irrelevant or duplicate entries, the authors were left with 29 articles that met their inclusion criteria. These papers formed the basis for their review of the latest knowledge surrounding POIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors began by reviewing the symptoms and diagnostic criteria most commonly associated with POIS. Because the condition is not formally recognized by diagnostic systems like the International Classification of Diseases or the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, researchers have had to rely on informal criteria. The most widely accepted standards were developed by Dutch psychiatrist Marcel Waldinger and his team, based on reports from 45 male patients. These criteria include flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, feverishness, and irritability; onset of symptoms shortly after ejaculation; recurrence in nearly every ejaculation; and a duration of symptoms typically lasting between two and seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later research has expanded upon these findings. In what remains the largest study of POIS to date, researcher Natale and colleagues in 2020 surveyed 302 men, 268 of whom met at least three of Waldinger’s diagnostic criteria. The most commonly reported symptoms were difficulty concentrating (reported by 84% of participants), extreme fatigue (83%), irritability (74%), and muscle weakness (70%). Many participants said they avoided sexual activity, masturbation, or even romantic relationships to prevent the debilitating symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While POIS has historically been viewed as a male-only condition, newer reports suggest it may also affect women. However, these cases are rare and under-documented, and more research is needed to understand how the condition manifests in female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of POIS remains a subject of intense debate. Early studies proposed that it might be an allergic or autoimmune reaction to a person’s own semen. Waldinger’s research supported this hypothesis through allergy skin tests, which showed positive results in a large majority of POIS patients. A few case studies even documented successful treatment through desensitization therapy using diluted samples of the patient’s semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet more recent studies have cast doubt on the allergic explanation. Some patients do not show typical allergy responses, and semen-specific antibodies are not always present. Other researchers have proposed alternative explanations, including the idea that POIS may stem from a chemical imbalance in the brain, a dysregulated immune or hormone response, or nervous system dysfunction. A particularly novel theory suggests that POIS results from minor nerve damage in the pelvic muscles responsible for ejaculation, similar to conditions that cause delayed muscle pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The varied and sometimes conflicting findings suggest that POIS may have multiple causes. Different patients may experience the condition due to different underlying mechanisms, making it difficult to define a one-size-fits-all explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to physical symptoms, POIS is frequently associated with mental health problems. Studies have reported high rates of depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder in those affected. One study found that 87.5% of POIS patients had at least one of these conditions. Another found a lower, but still significant, rate of 45%. Many individuals also experience premature ejaculation, likely due to low sexual activity or anxiety about triggering symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the exact cause of POIS remains unknown, treatment has been inconsistent and largely experimental. Doctors have tried a wide range of medications and therapies, targeting the suspected underlying causes. In the 2020 Natale study, some of the more commonly used medications included antihistamines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (commonly used to treat depression), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Of these, niacin and anti-inflammatory drugs appeared to be most effective for the highest number of participants, but still only helped a portion of those who tried them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other approaches have included hormone therapy, especially in men with low testosterone levels, and psychological interventions like relaxation techniques. A few cases have reported positive outcomes from desensitization therapy or immunotherapy. In one recent and unusual case, a man underwent surgery to block semen from interacting with immune cells in his body and reportedly saw his symptoms disappear. Another case reported improvement after undergoing a microbiota transplant to alter gut bacteria, though it’s unclear whether this treatment played a direct role in his recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the limited number of documented cases and the diversity in symptom expression and treatment outcomes, no official guidelines exist for treating POIS. Most medical professionals are unfamiliar with the condition, and some patients report difficulty discussing their symptoms due to embarrassment or stigma around sexual health. The authors of the review stress the need for personalized approaches to treatment and encourage clinicians to work closely with patients to identify potential triggers and helpful interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earlier reviews on POIS exist, this new article includes a larger and more recent body of research. The authors recommend that POIS be considered for inclusion in formal disease classification systems like the ICD or DSM to promote awareness and improve clinical recognition. They also emphasize the importance of continuing to explore the condition in both men and women and testing treatment strategies in larger patient samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12119-025-10372-x" target="_blank"&gt;Postorgasmic Illness Syndrome: Insights from Recent Literature on a Rare but Fascinating Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Krystian Wdowiak, Agnieszka Maciocha, and Julia Wąż.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 14:05:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNYl9zcllwS0JjV3hQc2xkR2ZwR2l4aWJHTHkxTXN2d0gzOEZDWTdGT0c0dEEyNUdObE1IZ0VMZEt6TEFHU2p6S1U4bVEwV1VmdVg5dmJfb1lJTHVGeTlXTHNhcXY5bnpyb0FNMjdhVlNqR09NMGZfZzlpNGtWZmxKdVFUa3NsekhNMDliY2FJeTFxR1RaZW1uamxDOVlQRXlKUFNESWhvcnI4RkdUdF92a3hrSXQ3MUk4WHBRRkc0OTQyVV9NVUFV</guid></item><item><title>胎盘中产生的激素可能驱动了人类大脑的进化- Earth.com | Hormones produced in the placenta may have driven human brain evolution - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNLWxCZ3o3OGJxakMtQWZQTk1CaVRTOWhMZmc3SWNBT1lHOFBCRXBnMnRNVnAxQ19RRTM5ck1XYkdSLXprZlFhQ3dHcUh0ZnNkV0s1ZlZfeE9vWDNsV3dvSUE3Y0xEWXRkeS1fZU5FQ0JnaHNWQllqTllBeXhWNGdMclZNOW9GaUdnYkFj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes us human? Most would say our minds. The ability to think, empathize, and build complex societies sets us apart from every other species on Earth. But where did this begin? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new hypothesis from researchers at Cambridge and Oxford suggests a surprising factor in human brain evolution: the placenta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This temporary organ that nurtures unborn babies may have driven the development of our large, social human &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-brains-solve-complex-problems-with-simple-tricks/"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-the-placenta-the-basics"&gt;Understanding the placenta – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The placenta is a dynamic, intelligent system that nurtures and safeguards new life from conception to delivery. It attaches to the lining of the uterus and connects to the fetus through the umbilical cord, acting as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/pregnancy-stress-may-have-lasting-effects-on-fetal-development/"&gt;a vital lifeline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through this connection, the placenta delivers oxygen and nutrients from the mother’s bloodstream to the fetus while removing carbon dioxide and waste products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also produces hormones – such as &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sperm-have-a-heat-activated-switch-that-may-be-key-to-fertility/"&gt;progesterone&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/germ-cells-play-a-crucial-role-in-aging-and-lifespan/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, and human chorionic gonadotropin – that help maintain the pregnancy and support fetal development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its physiological functions, the placenta serves as a protective barrier, filtering out many harmful substances, though not all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain viruses, bacteria, and drugs can still cross into fetal circulation, which underscores the importance of maternal health and prenatal care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hormones-and-social-traits"&gt;Hormones and social traits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Alex Tsompanidis, senior researcher at Cambridge’s &lt;a href="https://www.autismresearchcentre.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autism Research Centre&lt;/a&gt;, is the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Small variations in the prenatal levels of steroid hormones, like testosterone and oestrogen, can predict the rate of social and cognitive learning in infants and even the likelihood of conditions such as autism. This prompted us to consider their relevance for human evolution,” noted Dr. Tsompanidis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his co-authors argue that these hormones influenced not just individuals but helped shape human social traits across millennia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-brain-and-its-origins"&gt;Human brain and its origins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for a long time that living in larger, more complex social groups is associated with increases in the size of the brain. But we still don’t know what mechanisms may link these behavioral and physical adaptations in humans,” said Professor Robin Dunbar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests the missing piece may be sex steroid hormones like testosterone and oestrogens. These affect brain structure and connectivity even before birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers used “mini-brains” grown from stem cells in petri dishes. These clusters allowed them to observe how hormones shape developing neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that testosterone increases brain volume, while oestrogens enhance &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/your-brain-literally-changes-based-on-daily-activities-and-lifestyle/"&gt;neural&lt;/a&gt; connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-brain-size-and-the-placenta"&gt;Human brain size and the placenta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans and great apes share a powerful hormonal connection between mother and fetus via the placenta. But humans seem to have a unique advantage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The placenta regulates the duration of the pregnancy and the supply of nutrients to the fetus, both of which are crucial for the development of our species’ characteristically large brains. But the advantage of human placentas over those of other primates has been less clear,” noted Professor Graham Burton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That advantage may lie in hormone levels. Studies show that oestrogen levels in pregnant humans are higher than in other primates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hormones-supported-social-living"&gt;Hormones supported social living &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One human hallmark is our ability to maintain very large, stable groups. To manage this, our ancestors had to evolve both high fertility and reduced male competition. Sex steroid hormones may have supported both changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormones like testosterone drive male-like traits such as strength and competitiveness. In &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-brain-has-a-meal-memory-that-controls-hunger/"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, these traits exist but appear less extreme than in our close relatives or extinct cousins like Neanderthals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, traits linked to oestrogens, like reduced body hair and certain finger ratios, became more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Possibly because the placenta helps convert testosterone into oestrogens using an enzyme called aromatase. Humans have more of this enzyme than other primates, and interestingly, males may have slightly more than females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-placenta-influenced-human-brain-evolution"&gt;Placenta influenced human brain evolution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining all these pieces, the researchers argue that stronger placental function and elevated prenatal hormone levels together expanded brain size and connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lower ratio of testosterone to oestrogen could have reduced male aggression and boosted fertility in females. This allowed humans to live together in larger, more cooperative groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have been studying the effects of prenatal sex steroids on neurodevelopment for the past 20 years. This has led to the discovery that prenatal sex steroids are important for neurodiversity in human populations,” said Professor Simon Baron-Cohen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new hypothesis takes this further in arguing that these hormones may have also shaped the evolution of the human brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Tsompanidis, the team’s hypothesis puts pregnancy at the heart of our story as a species. “The human brain is remarkable and unique, but it does not develop in a vacuum.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adaptations in the placenta and the way it produces sex steroid hormones may have been crucial for our brain’s evolution, and for the emergence of the cognitive and social traits that make us human,” Dr. Tsompanidis concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/evan.70003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Evolutionary Anthropology Issues News and Reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:50:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNLWxCZ3o3OGJxakMtQWZQTk1CaVRTOWhMZmc3SWNBT1lHOFBCRXBnMnRNVnAxQ19RRTM5ck1XYkdSLXprZlFhQ3dHcUh0ZnNkV0s1ZlZfeE9vWDNsV3dvSUE3Y0xEWXRkeS1fZU5FQ0JnaHNWQllqTllBeXhWNGdMclZNOW9GaUdnYkFj</guid></item><item><title>肾脏健康和不安腿综合征解释：症状、原因和治愈方法-印度时报 | Kidney health and Restless Legs Syndrome explained: Symptoms, causes, and cure - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study has identified chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients—especially those undergoing dialysis—as a group at significantly higher risk of developing Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). The research highlights that RLS symptoms are highly prevalent in this population and are closely associated with iron deficiency, a condition frequently seen in CKD due to chronic inflammation, poor dietary intake, and blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2016 meta-analysis found that nearly one in four CKD patients experiences RLS, with higher rates among those on hemodialysis. Further, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies have shown lower iron concentrations in certain areas in RLS patients, suggesting that central, rather than peripheral, iron deficiency is more relevant to symptom development. In CKD, this imbalance is often worsened by dialysis-related blood loss and systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further noted that CKD patients with RLS had lower levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and serum iron, along with elevated TIBC, pointing to both absolute and functional iron deficiency. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and iron-targeted therapy in managing RLS symptoms and improving overall quality of life in CKD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restless Legs Syndrome—also called Willis-Ekbom Disease—is a neurological and sensory condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs. It typically occurs during periods of rest or inactivity, especially in the evening or at night, making it a sleep-disrupting disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to worsen in the evening and improves with movement. People often describe the sensations as aching, itching, throbbing, crawling, or pulling in the legs. Though it mostly affects the legs, it can occasionally impact the arms too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Signs and symptoms of RLS&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS symptoms can range from mild to severe and vary from person to person. Some of its key features include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discomfort after resting: Symptoms typically start when you're sitting or lying down for long periods, for example during a long drive, or while watching a move in a theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relief with movement: Stretching, pacing, or leg simple movement helps temporarily improve the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worse at night: Many experience trouble falling or staying asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night time twitching: RLS may be associated with another, more common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep, wherein the legs twitch and kick during sleep, possibly throughout the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impact on mood and focus: Chronic fatigue, depression, and difficulty concentrating are common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In severe cases, RLS symptoms occur more than twice a week and can interfere with work, social life, and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What causes RLS?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, there's no known cause for restless legs syndrome. However several contributing factors have been identified. Genetics appear to play a role, as RLS often runs in families. One of the most significant medical links is iron deficiency, especially low levels of iron in the brain, which interferes with dopamine production—an essential chemical for smooth muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;RLS is also frequently seen in people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, kidney disease, and peripheral neuropathy. Additionally, problems in the brain’s dopamine pathways, similar to those seen in Parkinson’s disease, have been associated with RLS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Managing RLS: What helps?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently there is no cure for RLS but its symptoms can often be managed with the right combination of treatment and lifestyle adjustments. The first step towards tackling the issue is to address and acknowledge underlying conditions like iron deficiency, diabetes, or sleep apnea. People with RLS are often advised to avoid or limit their intake of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, especially in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the nighttime symptoms, it has been observed that Creating a regular sleep routine and maintaining a calming bedtime environment has a positive effect on the body. Further, warm baths, leg massages, or the use of heating pads and ice packs also give relief. Some devices like vibration pads or specially designed foot wraps that apply gentle pressure have also proved to provide temporary relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jun 2025 13:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
