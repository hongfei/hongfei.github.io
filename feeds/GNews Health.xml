              &lt;p&gt;Fewer Americans say they &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/693362/drinking-rate-new-low-alcohol-concerns-surge.aspx"&gt;drink alcohol&lt;/a&gt; now than they have done for decades, but for those that do, the habit appears to have become dramatically deadlier over time, with the alcohol-related death rate in the U.S. almost doubling in the last twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles examined data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find that the rate of alcohol-related death increased between 1999 and 2024, with an especially sharp uptick during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. And while such deaths have declined since that peak, they remain markedly high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted policies to reduce excessive alcohol consumption and improve access to treatment,” the authors write in a paper &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/globalpublichealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgph.0004623"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in PLOS Global Health.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A shocking rise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new findings jibe with past studies that also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alcohol-is-killing-more-americans-than-ever-1840862638"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; alcohol-related deaths in America have been climbing for decades. But it remained unclear as to the specific kinds of deaths caused by alcohol, or whether the increase in deadly drinking seen during the pandemic has been sustained.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To try and tease apart the answers to those questions, the researchers analyzed mortality data from the CDC across 14 causes of death induced by alcohol use. These included alcoholic liver disease, several forms of alcohol poisoning, as well as mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the rate of alcohol-related deaths rose 89% between 1999 and 2024, the researchers found. The single deadliest year during this period was 2021, which saw 54,258 reported deaths that year. By 2024, deaths had begun to level off, but the average alcohol-induced death rate was still 25% higher than it was in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Trends in deadly drinking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings also offer more clarity on who is dying from alcohol misuse, and why, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of alcohol-related deaths were caused by alcoholic liver disease, followed by mental and behavioral conditions caused by alcohol. Interestingly, the rate of alcohol poisoning deaths remained low throughout the study period, indicating that acute overdoses are relatively uncommon compared to chronic and heavy alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alcohol-related deaths have historically been more common among men, but the researchers’ findings suggest that may be changing: They found that the single largest increase in the death rate of any demographic during the study period was among women aged 25–34, followed by men in the same age group. American Indian and Alaskan Native populations were also found to be at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The rapid rise of alcohol-induced deaths among women is particularly concerning. Although men still die at higher rates, the gender gap appears to be closing,” said senior study author Maria R. D’Orsogna, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Computational Medicine at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-09-analysis-alcohol-deaths.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Notably, for the population aged 25–34, the male-to-female mortality ratio has decreased from three-to-one in 1999 to two-to-one in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that they looked at deaths most directly tied to alcohol use, so their findings likely do not capture the full toll of alcohol on Americans’ health. Alcohol is known to raise the risk or worsen myriad chronic health conditions, including certain cancers. And other research has &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohol-topics-z/alcohol-facts-and-statistics/alcohol-related-emergencies-and-deaths-united-states#:~:text=The%20Alcohol%2DRelated%20Disease%20Impact,States%2C%20behind%20tobacco%2C%20poor%20diet"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that more than 178,000 deaths in the U.S. linked to excessive alcohol use occur every year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to figure out how best to prevent these deaths, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rise in alcohol-induced mortality and its heterogeneous trends across demographics highlight the need for a better understanding of the socioeconomic factors linked to excessive alcohol consumption and of targeted prevention and treatment efforts, particularly for males, youth, and the [American Indian/Alaska Native] population,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

            The US Food and Drug Administration has already made significant changes to this season’s shots: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/27/health/covid-vaccines-fda"&gt;limiting approval&lt;/a&gt; to adults 65 and older, and younger people who are at higher risk from Covid-19. The forthcoming vote from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, carries additional implications for vaccine access – and there are signs that the group could restrict access even further.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00053b6nrj9xrwiu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But scientific projection models from nine teams of researchers, summarized in a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.32469&amp;amp;utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2025.32469" target="_blank"&gt;study published Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Network Open, show that sticking to a universal Covid-19 vaccine recommendation – as has been in place in the US in recent years – has the potential to save thousands more lives than limiting the recommendation to high-risk groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00063b6ng3s36xhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While focusing on vaccination among individuals at the highest risk for severe outcomes, including those aged 65 and older and those with comorbidities, remains an effective ongoing strategy, our scenario projections demonstrate that maintaining the recommendation for all individuals to receive reformulated vaccines has the potential to save thousands more lives through both direct and indirect effects,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00073b6nfdz5js66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Over the past five years, the &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/about.html" target="_blank"&gt;US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub&lt;/a&gt; has provided nearly 20 rounds of projections estimating Covid-19 disease burden. Various teams build their models with a unique set of assumptions, which are then combined into ensemble projections for six scenarios based on different vaccine recommendations and viral immune escape — vulnerability to things like a new variant or waning immunity from prior infection or vaccination. The group’s work was used to guide the expansion of the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00215-0/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;primary COVID-19 vaccine schedule to school-age children&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7129e1.htm?s_cid=mm7129e1_w" target="_blank"&gt;booster recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in fall 2022.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00083b6nilxhkhn0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Models for last season – covering the period from April 2024 to April 2025 – included a worst-case scenario where there was no vaccine recommendation and high immune escape, and a best-case scenario where there was a universal vaccine recommendation and low immune escape.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s00093b6nna8o32ds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The scenario that the researchers say was most similar to the way last season actually played out involved high immune escape. The universal vaccine recommendation that was in place in this scenario was projected to reduce hospitalizations by 11% and deaths by 13% – essentially averting 104,000 hospitalizations and 9,000 deaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000a3b6np8pwhs1v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If vaccine recommendations had been limited to high-risk individuals, the benefit of the vaccine would still be substantial: an 8% reduction in hospitalizations and 10% reduction in deaths. But the expanded recommendations for all ages was projected to prevent an additional 28,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths, the study showed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000b3b6np74cck8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Adults ages 65 and older benefit the most under all vaccine scenarios, both directly and indirectly. A universal vaccine recommendation would reduce the burden of Covid-19 on seniors by an additional 3 to 4%, averting about 11,000 hospitalizations  and 1,000 deaths in this group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000c3b6nbuc19etf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This finding suggests substantial indirect benefits of universal vaccination and the continued value of broad vaccine recommendations,” the researchers wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000d3b6nse0xxfeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The projections for last season were first published by the Scenario Modeling Hub in June 2024, to help inform decision-making ahead of last year’s ACIP meeting. Actual epidemiological trends differed from assumptions that were made in the models at that time – burden was greater than expected during the summer and less in the winter – but projected deaths aligned closely with the models, creating confidence in the “robust accuracy” of the models among the researchers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000e3b6nnxvyy3xu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Projections for &lt;a href="https://covid19scenariomodelinghub.org/" target="_blank"&gt;this season&lt;/a&gt;, published by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub in June, paint a similar picture to last season.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000f3b6ni2p71cce@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recommending updated Covid-19 vaccines only for high-risk individuals will help to avoid an estimated 90,000 hospitalizations and 7,000 deaths – but broadening the recommendation for all people in the US would save an additional 1,000 lives and prevent an additional 26,000 hospitalizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpdi38s000g3b6n728jzlet@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We expect continued substantial burden of disease from COVID-19 in the US,” the researchers wrote in an executive summary of the findings. “All vaccination strategies are projected to significantly reduce disease burden. The greatest benefits will be seen if vaccines are offered to all ages.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfphuvci00003b6nlv0bnwl5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All work by the US COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub is public and “available for consideration” by ACIP and other experts, said Dr. Justin Lessler, a leader with the modeling hub and professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfphv52n00023b6n5uslhzsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The modeling work was not presented at ACIP’s June meeting this year and there’s “no indication” that it will presented at this week’s meeting, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfpi2uif00053b6niie22wzd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We continue to share our results with the CDC and are working to make them more easily available to a broader range of organizations who are providing vaccine guidance,” Lessler said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Respiratory virus season is coming. Policy changes based on misinterpreted data will have immediate, real-world consequences. Frankly, even if the votes end up in favor of these vaccines, so much damage is being done through these public shows of vaccine skepticism and anti-vaccine rhetoric.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Thursday and Friday, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) plans to vote on three shots – the measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox vaccine; the hepatitis B vaccine given at birth; and Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The upcoming votes threaten parental choice,” Steier said. “Without ACIP recommendations, insurance may not cover vaccines. The Vaccines for Children program could stop providing them. Families who want to protect their children may lose that option.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The former top official in charge of vaccination at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/16/nx-s1-5542405/rfk-jr-acip-vaccine-advisory-panel-vote-delay-hepatitis-b-shot-in-infants" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the hepatitis B vaccine recommendation, for example, may be pushed from birth to four years of age, which could mean the virus, which has dropped by 99% among young people, begins spreading in greater numbers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The committee may also &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/16/vaccine-recommendations-anti-vax-data" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;further narrow&lt;/a&gt; Covid vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We’re expecting them to present unverified VAERS reports as if they’re confirmed vaccine deaths,” Steier said, comparing that tactic to “treating every 911 call as proof of a crime.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Several new members have a history of opposing vaccines, especially Covid vaccines and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Remember, the Lord Jesus did not fear lepers, and leprosy was (and continues to be) a highly contagious infectious disease,” Catherine Stein, a professor in the department of population and quantitative health sciences at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220601043817/https://www.allinohio.com/an-epidemiologists-perspective-on-covid-19-the-other-side/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021. “Not only did He heal them, but He touched them. He showed no fear, nor did He ‘socially distance’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Stein wrote that she was motivated by her religious ideology to reject precautions like wearing face masks, which she said function as a “symbol of fear” while also harming the wearer’s health, which is not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She argued that “as Christians, we should not fear death”. She also claimed that “this virus is not the scary killer the media and government portray it to be”, even in the midst of deadly waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In her off-work hours, Stein has &lt;a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20484834-stein-hb-624-testimony" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worked&lt;/a&gt; as a researcher for Health Freedom Ohio, an antivax group &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;aligned&lt;/a&gt; with Children’s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine organization previously helmed by Robert F Kennedy Jr, who is now head of HHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In February 2020, she signed on to a &lt;a href="https://freedomofconscience.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IRF-Roundtable-Protecting-Religious-Freedom.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; urging Trump to reexamine school and daycare vaccine mandates and to focus on “ending the persecution of the unvaccinated people of faith”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kirk Milhoan is a pediatric cardiologist who has advocated against Covid vaccines because of the extremely rare possibility of myocarditis, or swelling of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We should stop it and test it more before we move forward,” Milhoan &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/mrna-vaccines-trump-boast-under-gop-attacks-legislation/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; KFF Health News in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Milhoan is a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, formerly known as the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance, which has promoted ineffective and often unsafe ivermectin treatments for Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Hawaii medical board filed complaints and &lt;a href="https://www.mauinews.com/news/local-news/2022/04/doctors-cleared-of-covid-19-misinformation-allegations/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; his medical license, though his license was ultimately upheld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Evelyn Griffin, once an obstetrician/gynecologist who &lt;a href="https://x.com/EvelynGriffinM1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;shifted&lt;/a&gt; to “holistic health”, implied at a “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/centralcitynews.us/videos/3843797775903484/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Louisiana health freedom day&lt;/a&gt;” event in May 2024 that vaccines are unsafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“When the [Covid] vaccine came out, they blindly believed that the vaccine had no harm,” she said of other doctors. “In medical school, we were taught the childhood vaccines – we were taught that they were harmless, and we were taught to just memorize the schedule.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Griffin participated in a “Stop Vax Passports” &lt;a href="https://stopvaxpassports.org/webinar-covid-injections-and-women-miscarriage-infertility-and-more/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt;, speaking about her personal experience “treating post-injection women” and “defeating vaccine mandates for children in Louisiana.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hillary Blackburn, the daughter-in-law of Sen.

            While human cases of rabies in the United States are rare, it’s still a deadly disease: six people have died from rabies nationwide since September 2024, a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson confirmed to CNN. In addition, the CDC is tracking 14 potential outbreaks in 20 states,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w79u00013b6n24jvpvix@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What is rabies? How is it transmitted and by which animals? What are the symptoms of infection in humans, and is there a vaccine? How should rabies exposure be treated? And what can people do to reduce their risk of exposure?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To guide us through these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at the George Washington University. Wen previously served as Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0w38y00003b6nsorm7l7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What is rabies, and how is it transmitted?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00073b6nafmcn7j6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Rabies is caused by a &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rabies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351821" target="_blank"&gt;deadly virus&lt;/a&gt; that is spread mainly through the saliva of infected animals. The rabies virus is part of the Rhabdoviridae family and genus Lyssavirus, which comprises 16 virus species. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;All 16&lt;/a&gt; can cause rabies disease in humans, though the rabies virus is by far the most common cause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00083b6nw3gngx37@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This virus is typically transmitted through an animal bite, though scratches or &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;direct contact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/23930-mucosa" target="_blank"&gt;mucosa&lt;/a&gt; can also spread the virus. For instance, if the saliva of the infected animal comes in contact with a human’s eyes, mouth or open wounds, the virus could be spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e00093b6no90dkcc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The virus primarily affects the central nervous system, with inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;incubation period&lt;/a&gt;, the time between exposure to the virus and symptom onset, may last weeks to months. Once a person starts showing symptoms of rabies, the disease is nearly always fatal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000a3b6nhohp8qht@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs are responsible for the majority of human rabies deaths worldwide, and young children are frequent victims, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. In the United States, where rabid dogs are far less common due to effective rabies prevention programs, contact with infected bats is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html#:~:text=Nearly%20three%20in%20four%20Americans,States%20were%20infected%20by%20bats." target="_blank"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of human rabies deaths. Rabies can be found in many other wildlife species, including raccoons, skunks, coyotes and foxes. According to the CDC, around &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;4,000&lt;/a&gt; animal rabies cases are reported every year, with 90% occurring in wildlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000c3b6n5ug26anx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; During the incubation period, there are typically no symptoms. Weeks to months after exposure, an infected person may experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;flu-like symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that can include fever, headache and overall body aches. Discomfort, such as a prickling sensation, at the site of the bite is also possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000e3b6ndrrfnljc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms quickly progress. Within two weeks, the infected person starts having increasingly severe symptoms such as confusion, agitation, hallucinations and aggressive behavior. A classic symptom is hydrophobia, or fear of water: Despite feeling very thirsty, the individual may seem to panic at the sight of fluids. The person may also produce a lot of saliva and appear agitated, thrashing arms and legs. Death occurs not long after.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Who is at higher risk for rabies?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; According to the CDC, someone traveling to areas where rabid dogs are a problem is at a higher risk of contracting the rabies virus, as are people who may encounter animals through work or leisure activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000h3b6nbq8kcmi9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/country-data/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;helpful website&lt;/a&gt; that lists rabies status by country. Information includes the prevalence of rabies, whether a robust surveillance and prevention program is in place, and whether treatment is readily available if exposure occurs. WHO also has a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/rabies" target="_blank"&gt;useful website&lt;/a&gt; documenting areas with recent cases of human rabies. Annually, an estimated 60,000 people die from rabies worldwide; &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/rabies#tab=tab_1" target="_blank"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of these fatalities occur in Africa and Asia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000i3b6njqhp26f4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are visiting a country with a higher rabies risk, consider taking extra precautions, especially if it will be difficult to access rabies treatment if you are exposed to the virus. Veterinarians, veterinary technicians, animal control officers, wildlife workers, laboratory workers who handle live rabies virus and people in similar professions should also consider prophylaxis. The same goes for people planning to hike in remote areas with dog-transmitted rabies or to explore caves in regions where rabid bats have been.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000j3b6nwlhgiynk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Can you explain what this prophylaxis is? Can people get vaccinated against rabies?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000k3b6n3lt9746x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Someone at high risk of being exposed to rabies can get the rabies vaccine as part of what’s called pre-exposure prophylaxis — that is, vaccination before any exposure occurs — to provide protection in case contact with the virus happens later. In these cases, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/pre-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the vaccine spaced seven days apart.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000l3b6n8wqau4mn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Depending on an individual’s risk exposure, the CDC recommends taking additional precautions. People in Risk Category 1, the highest risk, should have their blood checked for antibody titers six months after the second dose of the vaccine to make sure they are optimally protected. This category includes lab workers in contact with live or concentrated virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfolvd2p000a3b6nmxykdihk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People in Risk Category 2, which includes those who frequently handle bats or dead animals, should have their antibody titers checked every two years. Most veterinarians, technicians, wildlife workers and animal control officers are considered Risk Category 3: They can either opt for a one-time antibody titer check between one to three years after the two-dose vaccination or receive a one-time booster.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000m3b6ngy4yrvfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the general US population, however, the rabies vaccine is not recommended as pre-exposure prophylaxis. The vaccine is essential, though, as part of post-exposure prophylaxis, the therapies given to someone after a possible rabies exposure to prevent the disease from developing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000n3b6nhzb2whca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is considered a possible rabies exposure?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000o3b6nmyocsg9u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The clearest example is someone who has been bitten by a wild dog, bat, fox, raccoon or other animal known to carry rabies. If someone had direct contact with a bat — for instance, waking up to find a bat in the room — this is also considered a possible exposure &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/diagnosis/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;unless a bite or scratch&lt;/a&gt; can be definitively ruled out. If possible, contain the animal so it can be observed and tested, but do not attempt to capture it if that may result in additional exposure. If you find a dead bat, do not throw it away. Do not touch it or allow other people or pets to touch it. Instead, call animal control so that the bat can be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfn0x48e000p3b6ntzx1l1vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you are not sure whether a possible exposure warrants treatment, it is always best to contact a health care provider. Your local or state health department can also help evaluate whether you need rabies-related care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; If you suspect rabies exposure, seek medical care right away. First, contact your primary care physician, who will generally refer you to the hospital emergency department for the first part of the treatment. Some urgent care centers may also administer the treatment. If you do not have a primary care physician, go directly to the emergency department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you have a wound, it will be washed thoroughly with soap and water immediately. According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/clinical-care/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html#:~:text=Post%2Dexposure%20prophylaxis%20recommendations&amp;amp;text=A%20dose%20of%20human%20rabies,14%20after%20the%20first%20dose." target="_blank"&gt;CDC recommendations&lt;/a&gt;, what will happen next depends on whether you have ever been vaccinated against rabies. If you have never been vaccinated against rabies, you will be given both the human rabies immunoglobulin and a rabies vaccine. You will then need three more doses of the vaccine, on Days 3, 7 and 14 (Day 0 being the day you received the first dose). People with immune disorders would receive a fifth dose on Day 28.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If you have been vaccinated against rabies, you would not receive the immunoglobulin. However, you would still need two doses of the vaccine, one given on the initial day and one three days later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Keep your pets up-to-date on their &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;rabies vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. Stay away from wildlife and stray animals, and make sure your pets do as well. Also teach children not to handle or approach unfamiliar animals. If you see a wild animal such as a fox or raccoon behaving unusually, do not get close, and contact animal control instead. In addition, try to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/bats.html" target="_blank"&gt;prevent bats&lt;/a&gt; from getting inside your home through windows, chimneys or other holes. Most importantly, if you, a family member or a pet is potentially exposed to rabies, seek medical care immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — A bat in Kent County has tested positive for rabies, the health department announced Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the county’s first rabies-positive animal of 2025. Officials did not specify where in Kent County the bat was found, but they urged residents to be careful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“During the fall, bats start looking for safe places to roost for the winter, which can sometimes lead them into homes or businesses,” stated Cathy Armstrong, communicable disease program supervisor. “If it’s unclear whether a person or pet may have had direct contact with a bat, testing the bat is the best way to rule out any risk of rabies exposure. Because bats have very small teeth, a bite may not always be obvious in situations such as when someone was sleeping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="mobile" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To capture a bat, you can use a container and a piece of cardboard while wearing gloves, pants and long sleeves. You can then call the Kent County Health Department at 616.632.7228 to determine whether the bat needs to be tested. If it does, you’ll bring the bat to the animal shelter for testing and then wait for results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p hidden data-minutemedia-viewport="desktop" data-player-id="761ovxjo" data-stn-player="" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, you shouldn’t touch bats or other wild animals, the health department said. You’re encouraged to keep your living spaces secure and make sure your pets are fully vaccinated against rabies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Statewide, 32 rabid bats have been confirmed so far this year, according to KCHD.&lt;/p&gt;

The recommendations impact numerous programmes, including school meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Just in the yoghurt aisle alone, some products could escape without a label while others could be grouped with hot dogs and cookies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That’s a big worry for the US$2.6 trillion (S$3.3 trillion) food industry because these healthier items have been a bright spot as consumers have pulled away from packaged food and sparked trends, such as the surge in demand for high-protein options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Greek yoghurt, which has more protein than other varieties, is now in nearly 74 per cent of US households, up 2 percentage points in the last year, according to NielsenIQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Adding to the concern is that more than half of all calories consumed by Americans are considered ultra-processed by the Nova system, the most commonly used standards developed outside the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“We are focusing narrowly on nutrition,” said Mr Kennedy, who has said highly processed food is poisoning Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;In response to a request for comment for this story, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement that “Americans deserve to know what’s in their food, so they can make informed choices for themselves and their families”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;So far, the administration largely hasn’t opted to unleash new regulations on the food industry, urging it to voluntarily strip out food dyes, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Crafting a definition of ultra-processed food could stretch out over years, giving big food companies time to influence the process, as they have successfully done for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Ms Rena Awada, a 43-year-old cooking blogger in Michigan, is emblematic of a shift toward healthier options. She looks for whole, unprocessed foods when she’s developing recipes or feeding her five kids. To boost protein levels, she might add Greek yogurt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;But navigating a healthy lifestyle could become a bit more complicated for Ms Awada and others in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I do try to limit the ultra-processed foods,” Ms Awada said. Sometimes she opts for convenience, but always checks ingredient labels, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I do like to know what I’m feeding my kids and what I’m using in my recipes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The debate over what should be considered ultra-processed food, or UPF, gets ratcheted up around foods engineered to deliver health benefits, such as higher protein or lowered sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That could ensnare a wide range of products, including protein powder, salad dressings, whole-grain breads with preservatives to extend shelf life and plant-based meat options, like those from Beyond Meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Mr John Thomas, a 33-year-old vegan bodybuilder based in Tampa, Florida, said he views some processed options, such as textured vegetable protein, as healthier than junk food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“I view that as still a relatively healthy food,” he said. “It’s processed – but it’s not an Oreo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The Trump administration first floated the idea of defining ultra-processed food in July and a fierce lobbying fight is under way over whether a federal definition should focus on ingredients, processing or a combination. Some argue it should centre on how much a type of food is made up of beneficial nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“If you create a definition of ultra-processed food that doesn’t consider nutrient density, then you’re going to be grouping dairy products like cheese, flavoured yogurts, even flavoured milk, with things like soda and candy,” said Ms Wagner, the senior vice-president from the International Dairy Foods Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Food companies that make minimally processed foods and don’t rely on synthetic ingredients see an opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Earlier in 2025, the Food Integrity Collective, a non-profit, began the “Non-UPF Verified” pilot programme, working with packaged goods companies, including Spindrift sparkling water, to develop a standard that will establish which products get a label declaring them not ultra-processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The group, which previously launched the “Non-GMO Project” butterfly label, said it has more than 200 companies on its wait-list for verification once the standard is published this autumn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Mr Jon Silverman, a senior vice-president at Spindrift, said the company has always used real fruit in its beverages, “so this programme provides a clear way to highlight that difference for consumers”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;The Nova system, developed in Brazil, separates food into four buckets: unprocessed or minimally processed foods like fruits and vegetables; processed culinary ingredients such as butter or sugar; processed foods made through methods such as fermentation or canning, and finally ultra-processed foods, including hot dogs and frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;Former FDA commissioner David Kessler filed a petition in August urging the FDA to bypass a definition and instead effectively roll back usage of processed, refined carbohydrates in the US food supply by no longer considering them “generally regarded as safe”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;For example, his petition would target high-fructose corn syrup, flours and starches used in industrial food processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;That could be a much faster way to kick a lot of ultra-processed food out of US grocery stores than undergoing a typically years-long regulatory process that would be swayed by industry lobbying, said Mr Jerold Mande, a former senior USDA official and now the chief executive of Nourish Science, a non-profit focused on nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;In July, when the US government began considering creating a definition for processed food, it acknowledged the challenges that the food industry is worried about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“Foods considered to be ultra-processed may also include foods such as whole-grain products or yogurt, which are known to have beneficial effects on health,” US agencies said in materials released at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="font-body-baseline-regular text-primary" data-testid="article-paragraph-annotation-test-id"&gt;“It is important therefore to consider unintended consequences of an overly inclusive definition of UPFs that could discourage intake of potentially beneficial foods.” BLOOMBERG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Straits Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 11:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxNczFBbkZZb0tiR0RQV1NGZlpObjZHVjBuekZxY0RMTGxpU2hWTXFWTXA5RFoxeUwzMXNxVzFRSk05amhySWo5Uk80UlN3VS1ubkJiTHpWd3NJUnlQQ2ttaDV5dU8yblVqekJKcWo2UVM3VnRvM2EwOVBvbTdoUDItaUJ6LW11RFdldEYxZERVN3k5bDRRZlVoWU1VMHBXa3pndXY1enhFSzFaNFRWVnJXU1FB</guid></item><item><title>房客专栏|我是一名心理学家。以下是正念如何帮助您变得更健康。-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/18/mindfulness-mental-physical-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YKKKV3QAQFF5BDOINCOOVVBBLA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most people know which lifestyle choices promote good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QDJ7QJNTWJHKJEGCQOXKSLEYLU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Think regular &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/01/10/foods-health-benefits-diet/" target="_blank"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="attribution"&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0"&gt;Just 15 months after receiving an award from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for excellence in community water fluoridation, the city of Grayling, Michigan, changed course.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0"&gt;With little notice or fanfare, council members voted unanimously in May to end Grayling’s decadeslong treatment program. The city shut down the equipment used to deliver the drinking water additive less than two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0"&gt;Although it already paid for them, the town returned six unopened barrels of the fluoride treatment to the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0"&gt;Personal choice was the issue, said City Manager Erich Podjaske. “Why are we forcing something on residents and business owners, some of which don’t want fluoride in their water?” he said. He saw arguments for and against treatment in his research, he said, and figured that those who want fluoride can still get it at the dentist or in their toothpaste.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.1"&gt;Drinking water fluoridation is widely heralded as a public health triumph, but it’s had critics since it was pioneered 80 years ago in Grand Rapids, about 150 miles southwest of Grayling. While once largely on the fringes, fluoridation skeptics now hold sway in federal, state and local government, and their arguments have seeped into the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0"&gt;Even in the state where the treatment began, communities are backpedaling. And because customer notice requirements are patchy, people may not even know about it when their fluoridation stops.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, has called fluoride “industrial waste” and supports an end to community water fluoridation. The head of the Food and Drug Administration said on a newscast that the CDC’s online description of water fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements is “misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0"&gt;The CDC, which is in the midst of a leadership exodus and staff revolt, and the Environmental Protection Agency are reviewing their respective approaches to fluoride in drinking water. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s administration dismantled the CDC’s Division of Oral Health, which, among other initiatives, provided research and technical assistance on fluoridation. That’s the office that helped present awards for well-run programs like the one in Grayling.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0"&gt;Since Kennedy was elevated to the nation’s top health post, Utah and Florida became the first states to ban communities from adding fluoride to public drinking water. The Utah ban included measures to make prescription fluoride supplements more accessible — but now, the FDA is moving to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-begins-action-remove-ingestible-fluoride-prescription-drug-products-children-market"&gt;remove certain types of those supplements for children from the market&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0"&gt;Altogether, legislation was introduced this year in at least 21 states to prohibit or roll back provisions related to adding fluoride to public water systems, according to Abby Francl, policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. In addition, citing Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” initiative, Oklahoma’s governor issued an executive order instructing state agencies to cease promotion of fluoridation in the public water supply while it reviews the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0"&gt;Some local communities across the country opted to stop treatment this year, including at least four in Alabama, the state with the second-lowest number of dentists per resident. Others are debating it. On Michigan’s east side, the medical director of St. Clair County’s health department &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26073651-memorandum-st-clair-county-michigan-june-17-2025/"&gt;urged the agency&lt;/a&gt; to take steps to “prohibit the addition of fluoride” to public water systems. Two Upper Peninsula cities with a shared water system had special council meetings this summer on fluoridation. In Hillsdale, the acting mayor has said that ending fluoridation is a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0"&gt;“I want to reform the water system now that we have RFK in Health and Human Services,” Joshua Paladino told a local paper in November. Paladino added in an email to ProPublica that he sees public water fluoridation as an imprecise tool because it gives a standard dose across the population.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0"&gt;According to Michigan’s environmental agency, some communities had temporarily stopped fluoridation and were “hesitant to restart because of uncertainty.” That prompted it to &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/egle/-/media/Project/Websites/egle/Documents/Programs/DWEHD/Community-Water-Supply/Correspondence/Memo-2025-03-20-Floridation-of-Public-Drinking-Water.pdf?rev=ffe34c06d888439cb3cb81ec79cc8ed6"&gt;issue a five-page statement&lt;/a&gt; with the state health department in March, stressing that the levels recommended for water suppliers — 0.7 milligrams per liter of water — have no adverse health effects and that fluoridation benefits everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="18.0"&gt;“Local anti-fluoride movements can be vocal and persistent, but do not necessarily represent the viewpoints of the greater community,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0"&gt;Communities that end fluoridation will see more decaying teeth, according to Margherita Fontana, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry. Young children, older adults, people with disabilities and people who are poor are especially at risk, she said, but everyone will be vulnerable. Excessive tooth decay in children can require treatment in hospitals, under anesthesia. In rare but extreme cases, &lt;a href="https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/death-from-a-toothache-the-story-of-deamonte-driver-and-where-we-stand-today-in-ensuring-access-to-dental-health-care-for-children-in-the-district/"&gt;it can lead to death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0"&gt;“It’s unfortunate, because we know how to prevent the disease,” Fontana said. “So it just seems like we’re going backwards in time rather than forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0"&gt;A handful of states require customer notification when fluoridation ends. New York mandates such notice, yet &lt;a href="https://www.wkbw.com/news/local-news/buffalo-water-customers-without-fluoride-for-nearly-a-decade-report-shows"&gt;fluoridation in Buffalo lapsed&lt;/a&gt; for years before it was widely known. Outside Detroit, the city of Wyandotte suspended treatment about a decade ago, despite saying on its website until early this summer that it used fluoride. The claim was removed &lt;a href="https://planetdetroit.org/2025/06/fluoride-levels-in-wyandotte/"&gt;only after a local reporter raised the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0"&gt;Michigan doesn’t have a statewide protocol for notifying residents when fluoridation stops. The environmental agency’s spokesperson said in an email that while it strongly recommends that communities inform customers, it doesn’t have the authority to compel them.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0"&gt;Grayling’s water operator, Josh Carlson, said a district engineer at the agency told him he just needed to tell the state if the town decided to stop fluoridating the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.1"&gt;“It was almost like she was caught off guard that we actually did it,” Carlson said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;h3&gt;From Fringe to Mainstream&lt;/h3&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0"&gt;Water fluoridation began in 1945 in Grand Rapids, Michigan’s second-largest city, as part of a planned trial intended to last 15 years. Muskegon, on the Lake Michigan shore, served as the control, meaning its water was not treated with a fluoride additive. An Illinois city with naturally occurring fluoride in its water was another point of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0"&gt;Six years in, Muskegon officials withdrew from the trial after determining that the health benefits were so significant, they couldn’t deny treatment any longer to Muskegon’s children. Similar studies elsewhere continued for years, showing positive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0"&gt;“It was very usual to have dentures at a very young age” at the time, Fontana said. Fluoride treatment “was such a fantastic discovery, something so easy that nature already provided. It was already there. It was the greatest discovery, really, for oral health.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0"&gt;Grand Rapids celebrates its role in public health history with plaques and a totemic sculpture. But the treatment has been criticized since the early days as, variously, a Communist plot, forced mass medication and an industrial byproduct that causes more harm than good. (Fluoride additives are commonly derived from the processing of phosphate fertilizer.)&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0"&gt;Even as fluoridation became widespread, opposition persisted. Today’s critics note that fluoride is now available in toothpaste, as well as in ingestible drops and tablets like the ones for children that the FDA is working to remove from the marketplace. Dental care is also more accessible than it was in the 1940s. The need that fluoridated water was meant to address, critics say, isn’t as urgent.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0"&gt;While progress has made fluoridation’s effects less dramatic, they’re still significant. It was initially credited with a 65% reduction in tooth decay; now, it’s about 25%. No other fluoride source compares to the cost-effectiveness of drinking water, proponents say, especially for those least able to access dental care, either because of cost or because they live in areas with a shortage of dental providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0"&gt;Community water fluoridation is supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Dental Association and the American Medical Association. The CDC, at least for the moment, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html"&gt;still recommends it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0"&gt;Advocates say that its benefits are so pervasive, they’ve become invisible to many.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0"&gt;“Known benefits that are not visible, they take it for granted, whereas unknown risks are what they are always worried about,” said Jayanth Kumar, lead researcher on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37120936/"&gt;a systematic review&lt;/a&gt; of community water fluoridation and IQ. “Florida didn’t ban alcohol. Florida didn’t ban cigarettes. But they banned fluoride.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0"&gt;Critics say the National Toxicology Program’s &lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/research/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride"&gt;“state of the science” report&lt;/a&gt; from last year shows an association between fluoridated drinking water and a lowered IQ in children. But that assessment — which is both contested and much-cited — involves fluoride levels that are more than twice what the federal government recommends for drinking water, and it’s based on limited studies conducted outside the U.S., with different water conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0"&gt;Even the &lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/publications/monographs/mgraph08"&gt;report’s abstract&lt;/a&gt; says that “more studies are needed to fully understand the potential for lower fluoride exposure to affect children’s IQ.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0"&gt;In a lawsuit brought against the EPA by groups opposed to water fluoridation, a district judge relied in part on the NTP analysis in ruling that fluoridation presents such an “unreasonable risk” that the agency must take action. Even as it appeals the decision, the EPA said its review of new science on fluoride in drinking water “is being done in &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-will-expeditiously-review-new-science-fluoride-drinking-water"&gt;coordination with Secretary Kennedy and HHS&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0"&gt;The court ruling, the NTP report and the wavering stance of federal agencies have empowered a backlash to fluoridation in state and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0"&gt;Stuart Cooper, executive director of the Fluoride Action Network, said he’s seen momentum shift over the last two decades as his group sought to eliminate fluoride treatment, not least as a plaintiff in the EPA lawsuit. Kennedy has given a jolt to the movement, he said. Now, “we have allies at every level.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0"&gt;“Legislators and city councilors are calling us instead of me having to do vice versa,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tooth Decay and Regrets&lt;/h3&gt;

        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0"&gt;In Grayling, questions about fluoridation were brewing for at least a year before the town changed course. Podjaske, the city manager, said he discussed it off and on with Carlson, the city’s water operator. When it came time to reorder the fluoride additive, Podjaske wondered: Is this really necessary?&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0"&gt;Carlson asked the state’s environmental agency about the protocol for discontinuing treatment and was told to keep the state posted. In April, Podjaske suggested adding the fluoridation question to the City Council’s agenda. At the May meeting, the council voted 4-0 to end treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0"&gt;“I figured the best option was don’t push it on people,’’ council member Jack Pettyjohn said about his vote. “Don’t force them to have it in their water.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0"&gt;There wasn’t any outreach to the public or health experts ahead of the vote. Meeting minutes say that Podjaske and Carlson discussed the removal of the fluoride additive after the water operator received “additional education and training.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0"&gt;But both men say that isn’t right. Fluoridation was already on the agenda when Carlson attended a training that wasn’t about the treatment, but where he had an informal conversation with an instructor that made him worry about fluoride’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0"&gt;The vote would’ve occurred even without Kennedy’s activism, Podjaske and Pettyjohn said. Carlson, though, noted how Grayling’s pivot played out in context of “some of the new narratives coming out of Washington.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0"&gt;“There’s a lot of mixed feelings about RFK Jr., but he seems to be anti-fluoride,” Carlson said. “I don’t know if that’s driving people’s complaints about fluoride.” With the proliferation of social media, he said, “I could see that being a factor, in the fact there’s more people with an opinion now.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0"&gt;At the same time, he said, locals are more tuned in to water issues following &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/flint-michigan-water-crisis-ten-years-after"&gt;the Flint water crisis&lt;/a&gt; and the contamination of waterways with PFAS chemicals linked to a nearby military base. &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-epa-pfas-drinking-water"&gt;PFAS are a group of “forever chemicals”&lt;/a&gt; that can carry a cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0"&gt;Carlson said that in the occasional feedback he’s gotten on fluoridation over the last couple of decades, “the negatives were more than the positives in recent years.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0"&gt;Following input from the state environmental agency, &lt;a href="https://www.cityofgrayling.org/citynews.asp?aid=432"&gt;Grayling posted a notice about the change online&lt;/a&gt; in August, 10 weeks after treatment stopped. Some people didn’t see it. Mary Bobenmoyer, owner and general manager of Our Town Coffee &amp;amp; Treats, didn’t know until a reporter asked her about it in late August. “They did it?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0"&gt;Bobenmoyer spent seven years as a dental assistant. She encourages children especially to get fluoride treatment at the dentist. But, she said, “I personally don’t think it should be filtered in our water. We should have free and clear water.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0"&gt;Over in Grand Rapids, there’s sporadic pushback on fluoridation, said water system manager Wayne Jernberg. But he hasn’t noticed any recent escalation. And he doesn’t see why there would be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.1"&gt;“We rely on the science of us,” Jernberg said. “We’ve been adding it for 80 years, OK? And we don’t see any issues in our community.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.2"&gt;Meanwhile, reports on dental health have caused some communities that dropped fluoridation to reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0"&gt;In Canada, just across the river from Detroit, the City Council of Windsor, Ontario, voted to stop fluoridation in 2013 after lengthy public debate. Less than six years later, the county health agency reported troubling outcomes from oral health screenings at area schools. It found that the percentage of children with decay or requiring urgent care increased 51% in five years, while the percentage of children that didn’t require any care decreased by 43%. The Windsor council soon decided to reintroduce water fluoridation, citing it as “a key prevention strategy.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.1"&gt;In the province of Alberta, Calgary’s council voted in 2011 to stop fluoridation in part because of community skepticism and because expensive repairs to the equipment were needed, according to Councillor Gian-Carlo Carrà. But in time, researchers found that &lt;a href="https://cumming.ucalgary.ca/news/calgary-childrens-dental-health-getting-worse-without-community-water-fluoridation"&gt;local children developed significantly more cavities&lt;/a&gt; than their peers in Edmonton, where water is fluoridated.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0"&gt;“We saved ourselves some money,” said Carrà. “Fast-forward 10 years, and the results are clear that dental outcomes for Calgarians are worse after 10 years of not having fluoride in the water.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.1"&gt;When fluoridation was put on the ballot in 2021, 62% of voters supported its reintroduction. It took more than 28 million Canadian dollars and several years to start treatment again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.2"&gt;But, Carrà said, those costs — and the money to run the system — seem worthwhile. “I’m just much more interested in doing as much good as I possibly can,” Carrà said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
    
                    
&lt;p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0"&gt;In Grayling, speaking more than two months after voting to end the treatment, Pettyjohn said he has an open mind about the future of fluoridation. “I would totally look at readdressing it, especially if the people of Grayling really wanted us to,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOZFiX6hDXQ" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The Simple 15-Minute Habit to Help Regulate &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt; After Meals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar levels&lt;/strong&gt; is crucial for overall health, especially for individuals with diabetes or insulin resistance. High &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; after meals can lead to various health complications, including fatigue, increased thirst, and long-term damage to organs. Fortunately, there's a simple, effective habit you can incorporate into your daily routine to help regulate your &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels: a 15-minute walk after eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a 15-Minute Walk Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engaging in a short walk after meals offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to better &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control. Here's a detailed breakdown of how this habit works and why it's so effective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Muscle Activation and Glucose Uptake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you walk, your muscles contract. This contraction requires energy, which is primarily derived from &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; in your bloodstream. As your muscles work, they pull &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; from the blood, effectively lowering &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Improved Insulin Sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity, even in small doses, can improve your body's sensitivity to &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Insulin&lt;/strong&gt; is a hormone that helps &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; enter your cells for energy. When you're &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; resistant, your cells don't respond well to &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt;, leading to elevated &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt;. A post-meal walk can enhance &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; sensitivity, making it easier for &lt;strong&gt;glucose&lt;/strong&gt; to be utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking promotes healthy digestion. It helps move food through your digestive system more efficiently, reducing the likelihood of &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; spikes caused by rapid absorption of nutrients. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="./warning-signs-of-low-blood-sugar-hypoglycemia-and-what-to-do-y9q07b.html"&gt;Warning Signs Of Low Blood Sugar Hypoglycemia And What To Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Stress Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is a well-known stress reliever. Stress hormones can raise &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels, so incorporating a relaxing walk after meals can help counteract this effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Weight Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent physical activity contributes to weight management. Maintaining a healthy weight is directly linked to better &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Example:&lt;/strong&gt; A study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt; found that individuals who walked for 15 minutes after each meal experienced better &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control compared to those who walked for 45 minutes at once. This suggests that the timing of exercise is as important as the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Implement the 15-Minute Post-Meal Walk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this habit a part of your daily routine is easier than you might think. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Choose a Time and Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Select a time that works best for you after each meal. Whether it's after breakfast, lunch, or dinner (or all three!), consistency is key. Find a safe and accessible location for your walk. This could be around your neighborhood, in a park, or even indoors if the weather is unfavorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Set a Reminder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use your phone, calendar, or a simple sticky note to remind yourself to take a walk after eating. Creating a visual cue can help you stay on track, especially when you're first establishing the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Start Slowly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not used to regular physical activity, start with a gentle pace and gradually increase your speed as you become more comfortable. The goal is to engage your muscles and elevate your heart rate slightly, not to exhaust yourself. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="./unlocking-blood-sugar-balance-for-sustainable-weight-loss-iykdsd.html"&gt;Unlocking Blood Sugar Balance For Sustainable Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Make it Enjoyable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen to your favorite music, a podcast, or an audiobook during your walk. Walking with a friend or family member can also make the experience more enjoyable and help you stay motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Track Your Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use a fitness tracker or a simple notebook to record your walks. Monitoring your progress can provide a sense of accomplishment and encourage you to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table: Sample Walking Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;| Meal      | Time of Walk   | Location            | Notes                                      |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Breakfast | 8:00 AM        | Around the block    | Listen to a podcast                         |
| Lunch     | 1:00 PM        | Local park          | Walk with a colleague                         |
| Dinner    | 7:00 PM        | Neighborhood streets | Enjoy a relaxing stroll after a busy day |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Science Behind Post-Meal Exercise and &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies support the benefits of post-meal exercise for &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; management. Here are a few key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study 1: "Postprandial Walking Improves &lt;strong&gt;Glycemic Control&lt;/strong&gt; in Type 2 Diabetes"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study, published in &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Care&lt;/em&gt;, demonstrated that taking a short walk after meals significantly reduced postprandial (after-meal) &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; spikes in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The researchers concluded that this simple intervention could be an effective strategy for managing &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study 2: "The Effect of Exercise Timing on Postprandial &lt;strong&gt;Glycemia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Insulinemia&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Sports Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, this study compared the effects of exercising before and after meals. The results indicated that post-meal exercise was more effective at reducing &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Study 3: "Effects of Low and Moderate Intensity Exercise on Postprandial &lt;strong&gt;Glucose&lt;/strong&gt; Levels"&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research, featured in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American College of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, found that even low-intensity exercise, such as a leisurely walk, could significantly improve &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control after meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential Benefits Beyond &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt; Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to regulating &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; levels, a 15-minute post-meal walk can offer a range of other health benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Improved Heart Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity is known to improve cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure, reducing cholesterol levels, and strengthening the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects. This can help reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Better Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consistent physical activity can improve sleep quality. A post-meal walk can help you wind down after dinner and prepare your body for a restful night's sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Increased Energy Levels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it may seem counterintuitive, physical activity can actually increase your energy levels. A short walk can help combat the afternoon slump and leave you feeling more alert and energized. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="./how-a-continuous-glucose-monitor-cgm-can-revolutionize-your-health-83zbwz.html"&gt;How A Continuous Glucose Monitor Cgm Can Revolutionize Your Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Stronger Bones and Muscles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking is a weight-bearing exercise that helps strengthen bones and muscles. This can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and improve overall mobility and balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Concerns and Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a 15-minute post-meal walk is generally safe and beneficial, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Individual Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have underlying health conditions. They can provide personalized recommendations based on your individual needs and medical history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Adjusting to Your Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to your body and adjust the intensity and duration of your walks as needed. If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop and rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Weather Conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be mindful of weather conditions and dress appropriately. Avoid walking in extreme heat or cold, and take necessary precautions to stay safe and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Footwear&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wear comfortable, supportive shoes to prevent foot pain and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Hydration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay hydrated by drinking water before, during, and after your walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: A Small Step for a Big Impact on &lt;strong&gt;Blood Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporating a 15-minute walk after meals is a simple yet powerful habit that can significantly improve your &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; control and overall health. By activating your muscles, improving &lt;strong&gt;insulin&lt;/strong&gt; sensitivity, enhancing digestion, reducing stress, and aiding in weight management, this small change can make a big difference. Start today and experience the many benefits of this easy-to-implement strategy. Your &lt;strong&gt;blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; will thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

There has never been a more socially acceptable time to be middle-aged.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A quick medical primer: &lt;b&gt;Perimenopause&lt;/b&gt; is the transition into menopause. It often starts in the mid-40s, though it can begin earlier. Thereâ€™s a bouillabaisse of symptoms as hormones fluctuate, from night sweats and hot flashes to erratic periods, weight gain, and mood swings. &lt;b&gt;Menopause&lt;/b&gt; is when youâ€™ve gone 12 months without a period. Some call this reverse puberty; my colleague Brooke Hauser calls it an &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/15/magazine/entering-my-punk-perimenopause/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/15/magazine/entering-my-punk-perimenopause/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;emotional mosh pit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My generation didnâ€™t invent this timeless passage â€” about 1.3 million women enter menopause every year â€” but weâ€™re the first to be so vocal about it. Women feel more comfortable sharing symptoms and asking for relief. Companies are taking notice and adding workplace benefits to help employees manage symptoms. For years, treatment was plagued by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/magazine/menopause-hot-flashes-hormone-therapy.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.mFtz.0ZjGpfGrLDqA&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/01/magazine/menopause-hot-flashes-hormone-therapy.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.mFtz.0ZjGpfGrLDqA&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;flawed research&lt;/a&gt;, connecting hormone therapy to elevated health risks. Finally, these &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/well/menopause-myths.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.aFZt.AwrNqllwEXFL&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/well/menopause-myths.html?unlocked_article_code=1.mk8.aFZt.AwrNqllwEXFL&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;myths are being dispelled&lt;/a&gt;, with meaningful consequences.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;States are taking action. This summer, Rhode Island became the first state to require employers to provide &lt;a href="https://rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/15/ril.pressrelease.inputform/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;amp;ID=375783" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;workplace accommodations&lt;/a&gt; for job applicants and employees experiencing menopause and menopause-related medical conditions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Maine enacted a law that &lt;a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2555074/governor-janet-mills-signs-menopause-bill-backed-by-halle-berry" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2555074/governor-janet-mills-signs-menopause-bill-backed-by-halle-berry"&gt;requires enhanced training&lt;/a&gt; for medical professionals and more accessible treatment options for women. California and New Jersey have &lt;a href="https://a21.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250409-papan-legislation-enhance-physician-training-menopause-approved-assembly" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://a21.asmdc.org/press-releases/20250409-papan-legislation-enhance-physician-training-menopause-approved-assembly"&gt;similar legislation&lt;/a&gt; pending. Five states introduced legislation that would mandate insurance coverage for menopause care; Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed &lt;a href="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1776784" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.billtrack50.com/billdetail/1776784"&gt;that stateâ€™s bill&lt;/a&gt; into law in July.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In Illinois, Oct. 12-18 is now &lt;a href="https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=25&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=SJR&amp;amp;SessionID=114&amp;amp;GA=104" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Menopause Awareness Week&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/health/menopause-bills-wellness" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/11/health/menopause-bills-wellness"&gt;recently passed bill&lt;/a&gt;. (A similar bill, introduced in Nevada, would have designated October as Menopause Awareness Month, but was vetoed by Governor Joe Lombardo, who has clearly never dealt with night sweats.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Last year, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts launched an &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/13/metro/menopause-perimenopause-hot-flash-millennials/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/11/13/metro/menopause-perimenopause-hot-flash-millennials/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;online support group&lt;/a&gt; specifically for employees experiencing perimenopause and menopause. Local tech startups are capitalizing on the shift. Here in Boston, Embr Labs is designing a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/09/business/innovation-beat-age-tech-startups/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/09/business/innovation-beat-age-tech-startups/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;wristband&lt;/a&gt; to help cool body temperature for women experiencing hot flashes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;What your grandmother used to call â€œthe changeâ€� has even become a cottage industry for influencers, luxury resorts, and food products.

For more on this trend, check out my pal Beth Teitellâ€™s meaty dive into the topic: â€œ&lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/15/lifestyle/protein-needs-grams/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Protein mania: Why everyoneâ€™s eating like a linebacker now&lt;/a&gt;.â€� (She also has interesting things to say about &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/25/lifestyle/weighted-vests-middle-age-fitness/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;weighted vests&lt;/a&gt;, an accessory I have yet to try. Maybe for my next birthday.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Of course, some charlatans want to exploit the menopause momentum. Scams abound, so much so that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/womens-health/experts-and-stories/the-latest/menopause-misinformation-is-everywhere-heres-how-to-detect-it" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;primer&lt;/a&gt; on how to detect menopause misinformation, with warnings about the proliferation of unregulated dietary supplements and TikTok influencers who tout hormone therapy without the proper credentials. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;As for me: Iâ€™ve written about how &lt;a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/2025/01/29/everything-to-know-perimenopause/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;overwhelmed&lt;/a&gt; I sometimes feel by the barrage of medical advice cluttering my social media feeds. Itâ€™s tempting to wonder if my limp hair is from perimenopause or cheap shampoo. Sometimes I question whether Iâ€™m screaming at my kids due to fluctuating hormones or because nobody in my house can put away their shoes. Often, I sit and wonder: Could an estrogen patch make all my problems melt away?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But, like anything else, itâ€™s complicated. Women need to be discerning consumers. Whatâ€™s right for your friend with night sweats might not be best for you with erratic periods. Commercialization is a risk whenever an issue finally gets mainstream attention.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But perimenopause and menopause are more than trends, and we have to separate the hormones from the hype. If I ever get a straight eight hours of sleep again, I just might have the brainpower to do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_center"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;ðŸ§© &lt;b&gt;3 Down:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/games/mini-crossword/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/games/mini-crossword/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter"&gt;Saturate (with)&lt;/a&gt; | â˜�ï¸� &lt;b&gt;76Â°&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/17/metro/new-england-boston-forecast/?s_campaign=spoint:newsletter" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Cloudy but warm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;5. It disrupts your digestion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee doesn’t just wake up the brain – it wakes up your gut too,” says Sanders. “Caffeine stimulates digestive hormones, speeding things along in the colon. It’s why so many people get that familiar urge to head to the loo after their first coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another compound in coffee, chlorogenic acid, triggers the “gastrocolic reflex” – a wave of movement that propels food through the gut. If you’re prone to digestive issues, this can set off symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/worst-foods-ibs/"&gt;People with IBS&lt;/a&gt; often find coffee worsens cramps, urgency or diarrhoea, and it can aggravate inflammatory bowel disorder,” says Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can also worsen heartburn. Caffeine stimulates stomach acid and relaxes the valve at the top of the stomach, increasing your risk of reflux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to avoid an upset stomach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If reflux or cramps are an issue, avoid drinking coffee on an empty stomach. “Try a smaller size or cold brew, which tends to be less acidic and better tolerated,” says Suresh. “If symptoms flare consistently, reduce your intake or switch to decaf to see if caffeine is the trigger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;6. It messes with your medication&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Caffeine can interact with many medicines,” says pharmacist Deborah Grayson, a specialist in drug-nutrient interaction. “It can amplify or counteract a drug’s action, or alter how it’s processed in the liver, leading to higher levels and increased risk of side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high caffeine intake may impair blood-thinners, like warfarin, by reducing platelets’ ability to clot, says Grayson. And drinking coffee within an hour of taking thyroid medication, levothyroxine, can reduce its absorption by half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take care with over-the-counter remedies too. Cold and flu remedies often contain stimulants such as pseudoephedrine, which raise heart rate and blood pressure and may disrupt sleep. “Caffeine can amplify these effects, so it should be used sparingly or avoided,” says Grayson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is added to many painkillers to increase their effectiveness, and drinking coffee may ramp them up further. “However, for some people, the extra caffeine may increase risk of gastritis or stomach bleeds, and also increase the risk of heartburn and indigestion,” says Grayson. “This risk is highest with aspirin, though it can also occur with paracetamol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to make sure your medication isn’t effected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, one or two coffees a day is safe with common medications,” says Grayson. “But keep a one-to-two-hour gap between taking them and drinking coffee and consult your GP or pharmacist if you’re unsure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;7. It exposes you to microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by researchers at the University of Birmingham found take-away coffee from high-street chains contains substantial levels of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/skin/health-risks-forever-chemicals/"&gt;microplastics – tiny fragments of plastic, shed from packaging&lt;/a&gt;, that can accumulate in the body and may harm health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Birmingham tested 155 hot and cold popular drinks, from supermarkets and cafés. Coffee ranked second highest (after tea) at 43 microplastic particles (MPs) per litre. The main source? Single-use cups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;How to avoid microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re grabbing coffee on the go, take a reusable cup,” says Erica Cirino at the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/"&gt;Plastic Pollution Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. “Choose stainless steel, ceramic or glass, and avoid plastic lids. At home, use ceramic or stainless-steel equipment and recycled-paper filters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS recommends adults stick below 400mg of caffeine a day. For pregnant women, it’s below 200mg a day. Caffeine levels vary widely according to the size and blend of your coffee. Here’s a quick guide from dietitian Bini Suresh.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin"&gt;Metformin&lt;/a&gt; has been prescribed to people with type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="174576" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; to manage blood sugar for more than 60 years, but scientists haven't been exactly sure how it works. A new study suggests it works directly in the brain, which could lead to new types of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine in the US, identifies a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_pathway"&gt;brain pathway&lt;/a&gt; that the drug seems to work through, in addition to the effects it has on biological processes in other areas of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been widely accepted that metformin lowers blood glucose primarily by reducing glucose output &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1120781"&gt;in the liver&lt;/a&gt;," says Makoto Fukuda, a pathophysiologist at Baylor. "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1994.tb13128.x"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that it acts through the gut."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/10-key-reasons-dementia-is-linked-with-diabetes"&gt;10 Key Reasons Dementia Is Linked With Diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We looked into the brain as it is widely recognized as a key regulator of whole-body glucose metabolism. We investigated whether and how the brain contributes to the anti-diabetic effects of metformin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.142545"&gt;Previous work&lt;/a&gt; by some of the same researchers had identified a protein in the brain called Rap1 as having an impact on glucose metabolism, particularly in a part of the brain called the ventromedial hypothalamus or (VMH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174579" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph.jpg" alt="Metformin injection chart" class="wp-image-174579 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph-425x415.jpg 425w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/MetforminGraph-600x586.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174579" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Direct brain injections of metformin lowered blood glucose in mice. (Lin et al., &lt;em&gt;Sci. Adv.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, tests on mice showed metformin traveling to the VMH, where it helps tackle &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/soups-and-shakes-diet-can-put-type-2-diabetes-into-remission-study-finds"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; by essentially turning off Rap1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers bred mice without Rap1, metformin then had no impact &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-distinct-new-form-of-diabetes-is-officially-recognized"&gt;on a diabetes-like condition&lt;/a&gt; – even though other drugs did. It's strong evidence that metformin works in the brain, through a different mechanism than other drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was also able to take a close look at the specific neurons metformin was changing activity in. Further down the line, that could lead to more targeted treatments that take aim at these neurons specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also investigated which cells in the VMH were involved in mediating metformin's effects," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/how-does-metformin-lower-blood-sugar"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Fukuda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that SF1 neurons are activated when metformin is introduced into the brain, suggesting they're directly involved in the drug's action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-metformin-a-wonder-drug-202109222605"&gt;Metformin is safe&lt;/a&gt;, long-lasting, and relatively affordable. It works by reducing the glucose produced by the liver and increasing how efficiently the body uses insulin, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/time-restricted-eating-helps-control-blood-sugar-in-type-2-diabetes"&gt;manage the symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we know it very probably works through the brain, as well as the liver and the gut. Clearly, this needs to be shown in human studies as well, but once that's established, we might be able to find ways to boost metformin's effects and make it more potent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also ties into other interesting studies that have found the same drug can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-medication-slows-brain-aging-in-monkeys"&gt;slow brain aging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/common-diabetes-drug-linked-to-exceptional-longevity-in-women"&gt;improve lifespan&lt;/a&gt;. With a better understanding of how metformin works, we may see it used for a broader range of purposes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This discovery changes how we think about metformin," &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/news/how-does-metformin-lower-blood-sugar"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Fukuda. "It's not just working in the liver or the gut, it's also acting in the brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that while the liver and intestines need high concentrations of the drug to respond, the brain reacts to much lower levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu3700"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_2 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My aunt has suffered some serious physical and mental health issues in her life. She lost a child at birth, and another to a tragic accident that also gravely injured her husband. She has suffered from depression, which isn’t surprising, considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is the kindest, sweetest human and an amazing mom to her other two children. She also works full-time and is beloved in her office. She was forced into menopause after a surgery she needed and is suffering from terrible symptoms. She has awful hot flashes where she starts dripping sweat and doesn’t sleep from night sweats and other common menopausal sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did some research and suggested she speak to her doctor about Hormone Replacement Therapy. But she’s afraid of the side effects. How can I get her to at least talk to someone and get all the information necessary to make the right decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweaty Auntie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_3 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend was recently sharing information with me about how hot flashes come about. My research shows that hot flashes are caused by the lack of estrogen during menopause, which disrupts the hypothalamus, otherwise known as the brain’s thermostat. In other words, your brain starts to overheat and sends messages to your body on how to cool down, which includes sweating so the moisture can then cool you from the outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HRT can be helpful to alleviate hot flashes and night sweats, but it does come with some risk and doesn’t work for everyone depending on many factors. Tell your auntie that though it may not work for her, and may cause headaches, nausea and other side effects, prolonged hot flashes can affect her quality of life and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Book her an appointment with her doctor and accompany her so you can ensure she gets all of the information. In the end, it’s her decision alone to make. But I’m certain she’ll appreciate your care and concern.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_2 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband is an exceptional cook and really enjoys it. However, he rarely accepts help in the kitchen, has trouble with executive functioning skills such as time management, and dinner is almost always an hour later than planned. On top of that, no matter how good anything tastes, he is dissatisfied with the outcome and blankets the meal with his own disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I get out from under this dark cloud? And how do I help him see that none of it is healthy other than the meal itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not Good Enough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_3 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your husband sounds very insecure and self-deprecating. Those are HIS problems, but they influence you. It’s hard to be with someone who is constantly negative. Not to state the obvious, but do you give him positive feedback about the food he’s created?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe your husband would benefit from some professional help. He may be experiencing anhedonia, which is defined as “the inability to experience pleasure from activities that are normally enjoyable and rewarding.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you could try to help him out by discussing the meal with him in advance. Say, for example, he’s making a lasagna. You could help him by preboiling the pasta, chopping the mushrooms, grating the cheese, etc. That could help with the time management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, while eating, you could discuss the meal in detail, as in, on a scale of 1-10, where does this fall for you, and where does it fall for me, and why. Deconstruct, make notes and recreate the dish. Once it gets to a 10, he can’t possibly complain. If he does, you could point out the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_4 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEEDBACK&lt;/strong&gt; Regarding the old friends who are now enemies (June 10):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader –&lt;/strong&gt; “The most logical explanation for the boyfriend's sister reacting in that manner is for some reason, she really, REALLY doesn't want her brother dating her now-former friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone needs to ask the sister why she doesn't want her brother dating her old friend.  It might be protectiveness, but it's also possible that there is someone else waiting in the wings that the sister wants to match him up with, even if he’s not interested in this hypothetical other person and never will be.  So, she's being rude to chase her old friend off.  Like some fantasy fairy tale in the former friend's head that she desperately wants manifested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Mental and personality issues can manifest during the college years, which may explain why she changed so much since they saw each other last.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-block dropdown_num_4 "&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader #2 –&lt;/strong&gt; “Some people get downright weird about their siblings dating their friends.”&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;

Other types of fatty fish, like mackerel and sardines, deliver the same benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eggs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you like them scrambled, hard-boiled, or over easy, experts say they’re great for your skin. “&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:17;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/a62282874/eggs-every-day-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eggs;cpos:17;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Eggs&lt;/a&gt; are a great source of vitamins A and E, which support cell growth and promote healthy skin hydration,” says Dr. Gratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pumpkin seeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumpkin seeds are a tasty source of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:18;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/g65992526/symptoms-of-zinc-deficiency/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:zinc;cpos:18;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt;, which is vital for skin health, says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:19;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Ffood-nutrition%2Fa66127718%2Ffoods-for-skin-health%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.;cpos:19;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Lena Bakovic, M.S., R.D.N., C.N.S.C.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Live It Up. “Zinc plays an important role in wound healing, inflammation, and immune function,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chickpeas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chickpeas are rich in protein, vitamin E, zinc, and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:20;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65893243/types-of-magnesium-supplements/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:magnesium;cpos:20;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, and help reduce inflammation and support collagen production,” Dr. Gratch explains. Their mild flavor also means you can enjoy them in chilis, salads, grain bowls, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Flaxseeds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a plant-based source of omega-3 fatty acids, Bakovic recommends flaxseeds. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:21;pos:1" href="https://ijprajournal.com/issue_dcp/The%20Science%20of%20Flaxseed%20in%20Skincare%20%20A%20Review%20on%20Its%20Moisturizing%20and%20Hydrating%20Benefits.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research;cpos:21;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that they help keep skin moist and combat the processes that promote premature aging and collagen breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you opt to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:22;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64542223/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-blueberries-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eat blueberries every day;cpos:22;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eat blueberries every day&lt;/a&gt; or are looking for reasons to add more strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries to your plate, experts say these help boost skin health. “Antioxidants found abundantly in plant-based foods like berries work to protect cells from oxidative stress damage,” says Bakovic. “This plays a role in healthy skin maintenance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quinoa&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like berries, Bakovic says that quinoa is a whole grain that is rich in antioxidants—particularly quercetin, which research in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:23;pos:1" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2025.1523905/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Frontiers in Pharmacology;cpos:23;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Pharmacology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found promotes skin barrier repair and reduces pigmentation and scarring for people with acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Turmeric&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakovic recommends seasoning your food with the spice. Research in the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:24;pos:1" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/7/3617" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Journal of Molecular Sciences;cpos:24;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has shown that curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, may help prevent premature skin aging, treat inflammation from psoriasis and acne, protect against sun damage, and reduce wound healing times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olive oil&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Use this in cooking and dressings,” suggests Pelitera. “Olive oil is a good source of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, providing support for healthy [cells and] tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Walnuts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nuts are great snack options that contain vitamin E, selenium, and healthy fats to nourish and protect the skin,” Dr. Gratch says. Walnuts are a great pick because they contain the highest concentration of omega-3 fatty acids of any nut, per &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:25;pos:1" href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/good-food/4-health-benefits-of-walnuts-and-how-much-you-should-eat/2024/02" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UC Davis Health;cpos:25;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UC Davis Health&lt;/a&gt; (they’re also a palatable source, if fish isn’t your thing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bell peppers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This colorful, crunchy veggie “provides a good source of vitamin C and vitamin A while also being high in water content for a source of hydration,” Pelitera says. Enjoying every color will ensure you’re getting a wide variety of antioxidants and beneficial plant compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Almonds&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Almonds are a powerful source of vitamin E, which is a fat-soluble vitamin and essential for skin health,” says Pelitera. Almond butter will deliver the same perks—just choose one made with just the nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dark chocolate is a good source of polyphenols, which can help inhibit enzymes that degrade collagen and elastin, which are important for encouraging supported skin structure and function,” Pelitera explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Water (and water-rich foods)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s not technically a food, but hydration is so important to healthy skin that H2O has to be on this list. “Drinking sufficient daily amounts of water as well as consuming foods with high water content (such as cucumbers and watermelon) helps to maintain skin moisture levels, working towards reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,” Bakovic explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 03:34:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1Ec1dJOFV0cGIyY1h2V0l5VnE2WGZXazh3c0FFYkNhVDhwcE9EZElsUjJka0J4WGZVcWY3TE9nWTVfdVdCcHp1dmRWRTJncEMtaXkwbWZmQTdMaDlIdDV3TG8zejNBRjF5cFJXd3c3VkdYcThEb1E</guid></item><item><title>美国成年人对学校疫苗接种要求有何看法？调查-德撒律新闻</title><link>https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/09/17/childhood-vaccine-immunization-debate-american-family-survey-covid-flu-mmr/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body mt-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__key-points-list col-12"&gt;&lt;div class="key-points-list-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supermajority of U.S. adults support mandatory vaccines for children attending public schools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is notable support for vaccination requirements across political lines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A majority of self-reported 2024 Trump voters favor required vaccinations for children.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A supermajority of Americans — including both Republicans and Democrats — believe vaccinating children is a public health issue, “so vaccines should be required for children to attend public schools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s the finding of the new American Family Survey, a collaboration between Brigham Young University’s Wheatley Institute, Deseret News and BYU’s Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. Because vaccines are a big topic right now, the finding is being released ahead of the full release of the survey in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Overall, more than two-thirds of U.S. adults (68.1%) believe vaccines should be required, while 20.5% say it’s a personal choice and 11.4% answered “don’t know.” Broken down by political party, 86.4% of Democrats, 53.6% of Republicans and 59.2% of independents say vaccines are a public health issue and support vaccination requirements for public schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Per the survey report, written by Christopher F. Karpowitz and Jeremy C. Pope, “Though it is now the subject of intense debates in Florida and in the nation as a whole, support for dropping vaccine requirements rarely attracts more than one-third support among any group and it is never more popular than keeping the requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pope and Karpowitz are the annual survey’s principal investigators and are political science professors at BYU. The nationally representative survey — the 11th edition — was conducted of 3,000 U.S. adults Aug. 6-18 by YouGov. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.1%. The full survey tackles a range of issues, from what concerns parents to views on marriage and the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“In the midst of ongoing disputes about vaccine schedules, requirement and availability,” Karpowitz and Pope write that “among self-reported 2024 Trump voters, a majority (51.9%) support required vaccinations, compared to 34.2% who do not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="1595"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/VWSOJ5R655FWDFEVWPOIMESI7E.JPG?auth=a51527a0c76461ad564a465f4d101621c35100be68f70281b93244ab3bf4dffd&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=425" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/VWSOJ5R655FWDFEVWPOIMESI7E.JPG?auth=a51527a0c76461ad564a465f4d101621c35100be68f70281b93244ab3bf4dffd&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=850 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;A patient receives a vaccination from public health nurse Donna Nicholson at the Salt Lake Public Health Center in Salt Lake City on Monday, Sept. 8, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Scott G Winterton, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Heated-ongoing-political-debate" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Heated ongoing political debate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The clearest difference of opinion is partisanship. Though most Republicans and Democrats support vaccination for school as a public health issue, the numbers show that some see it as a political issue, according to Karpowitz and Pope. They wrote: “It betrays a lack of trust in the public health bureaucracy (perhaps earned in some ways). It shows ways in which a subset of Republicans feel alienated from their government.” The two suggest that “should provoke us to figure out ways to build trust in these institutions and practices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1700" data-height="2700"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image dn-article-body__image-float-right"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/4EMAQ5ENVFD6JO7US76RJT7RZM.jpg?auth=a2b27a9c358f18ae0787dbf4db98b819bd69e36c954086c87cb4dc8dbb81f5e1&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=400&amp;amp;height=635" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/4EMAQ5ENVFD6JO7US76RJT7RZM.jpg?auth=a2b27a9c358f18ae0787dbf4db98b819bd69e36c954086c87cb4dc8dbb81f5e1&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=1270 2x"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;All kinds of vaccines, from those for COVID-19 to the vaccines traditionally required for school, have been the subject of heated ongoing debate. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long expressed vaccine skepticism and has recast the committee in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that makes vaccine recommendations. The newly minted Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices includes some who are at the very least vaccine wary. The committee is expected to make some of its recommendations this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But vaccination requirements for daycare and school entry are by state and local jurisdictions, as &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.kff.org/state-health-policy-data/a-look-at-recent-changes-to-state-vaccine-requirements-for-school-children/"&gt;KFF reported&lt;/a&gt;, although the federal government approves the child vaccination schedule, which is set by the CDC based on the advisory committee’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And the Trump administration “recently released a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-MAHA-Strategy-WH.pdf" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that calls for a new vaccine framework that includes reevaluating the childhood vaccine schedule and addressing vaccine injuries," per KFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;All states allow medical exemptions to school vaccine requirements. Washington, D.C., and 46 states (including Utah) allow exemptions for religious and/or personal belief. Just California, Connecticut, Maine and New York allow only the medical exemptions. Parents can ask that children be exempt for some vaccines, but not others, if they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;KFF said nine states have recently made changes that could result in more students requesting a nonmedical exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Pediatricians-on-childhood-immunization" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Pediatricians on childhood immunization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Pediatricians have been outspoken in support of vaccinations for children. As Utah pediatrician Dr. Paul Wirkus told Deseret News last week, “Immunization works both by protecting the individual and protecting the group because there will be some people who either can’t be immunized or those for whom the vaccine may not work fully. Group immunization is the ultimate act of caring for your neighbor while also caring for yourself. When people opt out of immunization they’re generally benefiting from the fact that their neighbors have protected them by forming a wall of immunity around them. That wall becomes a lot more porous if there are more people who don’t immunize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2032"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BWYDFKUR3ZFODAP7DYXDPSKQGY.JPG?auth=be18f7653cf0ba78168774ecdb21d06e70acc0b6380f2dcbf6a4d70e4c2846d3&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=541" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BWYDFKUR3ZFODAP7DYXDPSKQGY.JPG?auth=be18f7653cf0ba78168774ecdb21d06e70acc0b6380f2dcbf6a4d70e4c2846d3&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1082 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;A vaccination calender hangs on a wall at the Salt Lake Public Health Center in Salt Lake City on Monday, Sept. 8, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Scott G Winterton, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/07/10/utah-childhood-vaccination-rates-dropping-coalition-public-health-worried/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/07/10/utah-childhood-vaccination-rates-dropping-coalition-public-health-worried/"&gt;Deseret News reported&lt;/a&gt;, Utah’s Community Vaccine Forum recently “sounded alarms about Utah’s declining vaccine uptake — especially expressing concern about measles, which has been more common in the U.S. recently than in many years.

A different Annenberg survey in January found that “more than 7 in 10 U.S. adults support making it mandatory for parents to vaccinate their children against preventable diseases,” Annenberg reported in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/09/03/cdc-turmoil-rfk-jr-call-resign-california-oregon-washington-vaccine-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/09/03/cdc-turmoil-rfk-jr-call-resign-california-oregon-washington-vaccine-guidelines/"&gt;Florida Gov.

Among all parents with minor children at home — those most affected by requirements — 28.6% call it personal choice, compared to 60.8% who believe vaccines are for public health and should be required. The numbers are slightly different for mothers of minors, compared to fathers of minors, with slightly more fathers saying it is a personal choice, at 31.4% compared to 26.4% for moms. Moms thus are more apt to favor requiring children to be immunized, 61.7%, compared to dads at 59.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s worth noting that endorsement of vaccines by parents with children under 18 at home, while still clearly a majority, was slightly lower than in the adult population as a whole. “But support for maintaining vaccine requirements is still more than twice as strong as for abandoning them,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The same pattern held when the results were limited to parents with elementary-age children under age 12 at home: 60.2% favor requiring vaccines, compared to 30.8% who deem vaccination a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“And in fact, this high-level support is true for many other demographics as well,” per the report, including age, education, race, gender, income, etc. “In all groups, a supermajority favored school vaccine requirements,” noting that support “far outpaces opposition.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 02:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxOZU1CYkRXazBsMXg4WVJEQWlqaVZUbDU5V2FTcF9GSmxXSmdiTVVhVWd4Q1Z3eVJnOHNkZ2lxRndnQUNFZlJFTDVINzlydWpVR3VZanZPQjBsRVNRWjZpaEN1X3R1d3MwbVNsVWJvODVtVDR4UHVGQzNNTXMyalVaWjdyMU44ME9YbEZ3WS1jSWhMcWFWdHZEX1VyeTJ4R0xlQzRKakdieERtNDB1dDM2eVZ1ejhZV0FJY0llbg</guid></item><item><title>科学家被扫入冰川上的冰井后死亡： “水然后推他” -冷却</title><link>https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/mendenhall-glacier-alaska-research-scientist-death/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;
					
&lt;p&gt;An Italian scientist conducting research on the Mendenhall Glacier in Alaska fell into a stream of meltwater and then plunged into a shaft in the ice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"The water then pushed him into a moulin, which is a vertical shaft in a glacier where meltwater funnels down," Alaska Department of Public Safety spokesperson Tess Williams &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-missing-meltwater-pushed-alaska-glacier-shaft-rcna228980" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; NBC News in an email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-happening"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.traveljuneau.com/things-to-do/glacier-sightseeing/mendenhall-glacier/" target="_blank"&gt;According&lt;/a&gt; to Travel Juneau, the Mendenhall Glacier is around 13 miles from Juneau. It is part of the larger &lt;a href="https://www.traveljuneau.com/things-to-do/glacier-sightseeing/juneau-icefield/" target="_blank"&gt;Juneau Icefield&lt;/a&gt;, the fifth-largest ice field in North America. It covers about 1,500 square miles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Riccardo Pozzobon fell into the meltwater shaft Sept. 3. Officials deemed a rescue attempt too dangerous, and Pozzobon was &lt;a href="https://snowbrains.com/italian-geologist-dies-on-alaskan-glacier-he-was-studying/" target="_blank"&gt;pronounced&lt;/a&gt; dead Sept. 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-07118206f0b2011f18dacb2c42b2c577 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-07118206f0b2011f18dacb2c42b2c577"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-a00f312a61122985f9450f8c102d1310 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-a00f312a61122985f9450f8c102d1310"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-b1e70174e1f9432bf139954efd104793 theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-b1e70174e1f9432bf139954efd104793"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-4a34e4c88bd63cb36c79bc3dacde4fb5 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-4a34e4c88bd63cb36c79bc3dacde4fb5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-913cfbc5c9a447efb831deba91f953af theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-913cfbc5c9a447efb831deba91f953af"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-76f61eefe0d23ddbaaa48278c2455b89 theco-programmatic-ev-ira-widget" id="theco-76f61eefe0d23ddbaaa48278c2455b89"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-55e0f321813ed7b8ccbc787ae3998045 theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-55e0f321813ed7b8ccbc787ae3998045"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-b4c28b3342244244978245dab6d0c256 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-b4c28b3342244244978245dab6d0c256"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A month prior to Pozzobon's accident, meltwater from the Mendenhall Glacier and the nearby Suicide Glacier triggered a &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/suicide-basin-flooding-alaska-melting-glaciers/" target="_blank"&gt;glacial lake outburst flood&lt;/a&gt;, The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/13/climate/alaska-juneau-flood-glacier.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The Mendenhall Glacier and Suicide Glacier used to be connected, but glacial melt has created a gap between the two called Suicide Basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-6a6cbeb6e8945055bccba405fe4926d2 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-6a6cbeb6e8945055bccba405fe4926d2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a glacial lake outburst flood, water encased in the glacier's ice suddenly erupts when that ice is displaced, typically because of melting or a landslide. This dammed water releases in a powerful surge that can cause immense flooding damage to surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="theco-inline-advertorial theco-target" id="theco-1724111176" data-theco-trackid="586927" data-theco-trackbid="1"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-ice-melt-important"&gt;Why is ice melt important?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glacial ice melt is a problem for glacial communities around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-35608adc3146fd5d1ea43ac5077a77c7 theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-35608adc3146fd5d1ea43ac5077a77c7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e5bbdd86e36c68c43a50dfde30121439 theco-palmetto-2-solar-widget" id="theco-e5bbdd86e36c68c43a50dfde30121439"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Glacial lake outburst floods are also a major concern in places including &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/glacial-outburst-resort-flood-pakistan/" target="_blank"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/glacier-lake-outburst-flood-nepal-china-tibet/" target="_blank"&gt;Tibet, and Nepal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond those who live near glaciers, ice melt impacts the planet as a whole. For one, melting ice contributes to &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/melting-glaciers-ice-loss-global-impacts/" target="_blank"&gt;rising sea levels&lt;/a&gt;. This influences everything from higher tides during &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/steroids-extreme-weather-climate-change-storms/" target="_blank"&gt;extreme weather&lt;/a&gt; events to flooding of coastal cities. NASA &lt;a href="https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/global-sea-level/ice-melt/" target="_blank"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that if all glaciers and ice sheets were to melt, the sea level would rise by 195 feet. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, melting ice is a &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/arctic-ice-melt-frozen-soil-permafrost-infectious-disease/" target="_blank"&gt;public health concern&lt;/a&gt;. As ice melts, bacteria and pathogens that were frozen in ice for centuries can be unearthed. These diseases can pass from Arctic &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/could-microbes-locked-arctic-ice-millennia-unleash-wave-deadly-diseases" target="_blank"&gt;animals to people&lt;/a&gt;, a process called zoonosis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-being-done-about-ice-melt"&gt;What's being done about ice melt?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/explore-critical-climate-issues" target="_blank"&gt;The climate crisis&lt;/a&gt; is a multifaceted issue with no quick solution. The World Meteorological Organization has &lt;a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/glacier-melt-will-unleash-avalanche-of-cascading-impacts" target="_blank"&gt;urged&lt;/a&gt; the global community to take glacial ice melt seriously, as the risks of melting glaciers will have large impacts on populations and economies everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-6325d2b6ac4ddc767b3e86d8d6704bab theco-ad-after-12th-p" id="theco-6325d2b6ac4ddc767b3e86d8d6704bab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the face of these risks, scientists have taken to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969725000841" target="_blank"&gt;geoengineering&lt;/a&gt; to study ways to mitigate ice melt, though as Inside Climate News &lt;a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/09092025/geoengineering-polar-ice-melt/" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, the idea is not widely seen as a true solution by mainstream climate scientists because of the alarming risk of unintended consequences. In the long term, the solution is to move away from atmosphere-heating &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/dirty-energy-fossil-fuel-sources/" target="_blank"&gt;dirty energy&lt;/a&gt; sources and toward renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;

Gavin Newsom again broke from the Trump administration by signing AB144, a new law that allows California to base immunization guidance on independent medical organizations instead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a step his office framed as rejecting “corrupted federal guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our states are united in putting science, safety, and transparency first — and in protecting families with clear, credible vaccine guidance,” Newsom and the three other governors said in a joint &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/17/following-trumps-politicization-of-cdc-west-coast-states-issue-unified-vaccine-recommendations-california-breaks-from-future-federal-guidance-with-new-law/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The West Coast Health Alliance stands united in protecting public health and always putting safety before politics.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="Inline-1" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsom’s office said the new law ensures California can chart its own path, with recommendations shaped by groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/public-health-for-all/publichealthforall.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;California’s Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; highlighted the law change Wednesday in a statement titled “Public Health for All,” saying the update ensures Californians “have access to life-saving vaccines and screenings.” They added that the recommendations focus on protecting those most at risk — including older adults, people with chronic conditions, pregnant people, children under 5, and residents of long-term care facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as public health leaders accuse the Trump administration of undermining the CDC by firing all its vaccine advisory committee members and replacing some of them with vaccine skeptics. These changes “dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans’ health,” the governor’s release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pediatrician Dr. Eric Ball told SFGATE that the West Coast Alliance guidelines bring needed clarity at a confusing time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of different messages that are coming out from different entities, and it’s nice to have kind of a unified message from these states that are based on expert recommendations of trusted medical sources,” he said. “I feel like this will lead to a lot more certainty, a lot less confusion amongst providers in California, as well as the patients here.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ball warned that unlike commercially insured residents, children who rely on the federally funded Vaccines for Children Program may face barriers. “There might be a two tiered system,” he said, noting it could create a disparity in access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball noted that the guidance also accounts for households with vulnerable family members, a gap he said the CDC didn’t address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These guidelines allow for vaccination based on high-risk conditions. One that’s ignored by the CDC is living in a household with an immunocompromised person,” he said. Ball pointed to his own family as an example, noting that while his teenage daughter is healthy, she could still bring home COVID-19 and put his immunocompromised wife at risk. The alliance’s approach, he said, ensures families like his can be protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UCSF, told SFGATE he found it “refreshing” that the West Coast was taking coordinated action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong noted that the guidelines will ensure that those at higher risk will get access to the care they need. “Simplicity and minimalism is everything. The more rules and conditions you put in, it not only hits the people who don’t get to take part, but it hits the people you want to take part,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coordinated guidance includes recommendations from health officers, who are certified medical doctors, and subject matter experts from each of the states. These experts stressed the importance of seasonal shots, which they said remain a critical tool to reduce severe illness, community transmission and strain on hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California Department of Public Health Director Dr. Erica Pan said, “We want the people who live and work in our states to know that there is a strong public health, healthcare, and scientific community that will continue to stand together to provide and use the data and evidence needed for you to make healthy choices, and we are here to protect our communities.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon’s Dr. Sejal Hathi described vaccines as a “critical tool to prevent severe illness and death,” adding that the four states in the West Coast Alliance are stepping in to provide guidance “in a void of federal leadership.” The combined approach is designed to empower communities to protect themselves, Washington’s health secretary Dennis Worsham added, while Hawaii health director Kenneth Fink noted that the guidance represents a united, science-based effort that he hopes will retain people’s trust in public health organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move carries weight beyond symbolism, Chin-Hong said, adding that Newsom’s signature makes the alliance’s recommendations enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just a guideline, but it makes it legally possible, not just … a bunch of states getting together,” he said. “Hopefully, others will do that, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-3" data-large-id="Inline-5" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 02:13:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNZjV6STJRYk9PRV9rX0huU0FpZF9pOVJsN3I4MEZZbmlMbnlnVU8tODVpSjZOWnNqLXlMREJiM2NPaGJUQmtReGZfdDVzbktQVFJMMXhUREc5cERYMGw2YmdWQW9ZZ3lEZEQxLU5uNzVTR1BZQTFZaVliNmZHUHVPZVk3dGpZaUltbUJMNEpTZ2dZUXNJSG5yS2UxWQ</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州和西部各州发布新冠疫苗指南，打破了CDC - CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-hawaii-oregon-washington-vaccines-covid-west-coast-health-alliance-cdc/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington on Wednesday issued unified recommendations on COVID-19, influenza and RSV vaccines that differ from those issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governors of the states, which make up the newly-formed West Coast Health Alliance, said in a joint press statement that their alliance was "fighting back against the Trump administration's assault on science." Earlier this month, the states &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-oregon-washington-health-alliance-cdc-vaccines-immunization/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;announced the formation of the alliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as a response to what it called the "weaponization" of the CDC, spearheaded by Health Secretary and vocal vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy's moves included &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-removes-members-cdc-immunization-advisory-committee-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;firing all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine recommendations committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;replacing them with apointees that include vaccine skeptics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;rolling back recommendations on who should receive COVID vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Public health leaders warn these moves dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans' health — undermining the CDC's credibility at a moment when trust and clarity are most needed," the alliance said Wednesday.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/Immunization/IMM-1481.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The West Coast Health Alliance's recommendations for respiratory viruses&lt;/a&gt; say the COVID vaccine should be given to "all who choose protection," and specifically children 6 months to 23 months old, all adults over 65, those younger than 65 with risk factors, and anyone pregnant or planning to get pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations largely mirror what the CDC previously advised until this year, when Kennedy announced &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-covid-vaccines-cdc-children-pregnant-women/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the CDC would no longer recommend the COVID vaccine for children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon criticized the alliance's recommendations in a statement to the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people's trust in public health agencies," Nixon said. "HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance also recommended that everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, and that all babies, people 50-74 years old with risk factors, and everyone 75 and	older receive the RSV vaccine.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he &lt;a href="https://www.dhcs.ca.gov/Documents/September-17-2025-MEDI-CAL-COVERAGE-OF-VACCINES-Stakeholder-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;had signed a new law, AB 144&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the state to base future immunization guidance on independent medical organizations rather than the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The law is designed to address which vaccines health insurance companies will cover, since insurers typically cover only those vaccines recommended by ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's announcement by the Western states comes on the same day former CDC chief Susan Monarez &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-susan-monarez-debra-houry-senate-testimony-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told a Senate committee that she was fired by Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for refusing to pre-approve childhood vaccine guidance regardless of the scientific data and refusing to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy, without cause.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states, including Colorado, Illinois, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/massachusetts-public-health-vaccines-covid/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, New Mexico, and Pennsylvania have issued COVID vaccine guidelines that differ from the CDC. Meanwhile, Florida this month &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/ron-desantis-florida-eliminate-childhood-vaccine-mandates/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;announced it would be the first state to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Spoiler: a lot of these are things many of us do without thinking.&lt;br&gt;Drinking alcohol beyond safe limits: This one’s obvious, but it’s worth repeating. Your liver processes alcohol, and too much of it over time can lead to fatty liver, hepatitis, or even cirrhosis.&lt;br&gt;Processed foods and the fatty liver connection: Fast food runs, frozen meals, and snacks loaded with refined sugar and trans fats? Bad news for your liver. These foods contribute to fatty liver disease, which is now one of the most common liver conditions in the US and Canada.&lt;br&gt;Too much sugar: Sodas, energy drinks, sweetened coffees—these are liver killers. Excess sugar gets converted into fat in the liver, which can eventually lead to scarring and inflammation.&lt;br&gt;Your liver doesn’t often shout when it’s struggling—it whispers through fatigue, bloating, brain fog, or subtle changes in your body. The tricky part? These signs are easy to brush off. But catching them early and changing a few everyday habits can make a world of difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 01:33:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>“太可怕了” ： Kristin Davis在拍摄时回忆起意外的健康诊断- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kristin-davis-shingles_n_68cb3518e4b09addd91e1a1d</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kristin Davis said the unexpected happened to her after she suddenly developed a “scary” bout of shingles on set. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Appearing on Wednesday’s episode of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwPdQILl7UY" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" “The Drew Barrymore Show,”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68cb3518e4b09addd91e1a1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwPdQILl7UY" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; “The Drew Barrymore Show,”&lt;/a&gt; the “Sex and the City” star, 60, opened up about developing shingles on her face, which she said forced her to take a break from filming. Davis did not specify when she was diagnosed nor which TV show she was starring in at the time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I had a crazy thing happen to me. We were filming the show, and I started getting this pain on my forehead, and I didn’t know what it was,” Davis explained. “I was really tired. I was flying back and forth. We had gone over schedule. My kids were back in L.A., and I ended up getting shingles on my face.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Davis called the health diagnosis “so scary” after she said blisters spread across her face. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I got a blistery rash that went down my face,” she told host Barrymore. “It was so scary. I thought shingles only happened on your torso, right? Like, your body. I’ve learned so many things.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shingles is a “painful rash illness” that happens when the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox, “reactivates” in someone’s body, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68cb3518e4b09addd91e1a1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/about/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. The rash is typically painful, itchy or tingly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The “And Just Like That” actor went on to caution fans to monitor their health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“What I learned is you need to talk to your doctor or your pharmacist about your risks for shingles and prevention,” Davis said. “Talk to your own doctor, because everyone’s going to have their own specific situation.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Elsewhere in the interview, Davis admitted getting shingles “took her by surprise” considering she prioritizes her health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I’m really healthy. I take such good care of myself, at least I try,” Davis said. “What I didn’t realize is that we know, scientifically, that when you’re over 50, your immune system weakens. So even if you’re doing all the things, you can still develop shingles.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Davis isn’t the only celebrity who has opened up about being diagnosed with shingles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Actor Demi Moore revealed in September that she developed shingles while filming the critically acclaimed horror sci-fi film “The Substance.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“To give you an idea of the intensity, my first week that I actually had off, where it was just [my co-star Margaret Qualley] working, I got shingles,” Moore told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-09-03/demi-moore-margaret-qualley-director-coralie-fargeat-the-substance-interview-fall-preview" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Los Angeles Times" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68cb3518e4b09addd91e1a1d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2024-09-03/demi-moore-margaret-qualley-director-coralie-fargeat-the-substance-interview-fall-preview" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. “And I then lost, like, 20 pounds.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It’s simple, tasty, and many people swear by it. But what is it made of? Social media influencers keep claiming that it helps with relaxation, better sleep, and calm nights. Does it really help you fall asleep faster, sleep deeper, or wake up more refreshed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s all you need to know about the magnesium mocktail, more popularly known as the Sleepy Girl Mocktail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Unable to sleep?

It plays roles in muscle relaxation, nerve transmission, and perhaps even lowering stress and anxiety. For some people, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;magnesium deficiency is linked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; with sleep disturbances. Taking magnesium in the evening may help with physical relaxation. However, it’s not clear that magnesium on its own reliably induces sleep in people without a deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ritual and sleep hygiene effects matter. Even if the ingredients are only modestly helpful, the act of preparing a relaxing drink, slowing down, avoiding screens, dimming lights, and having a bedtime ritual – all those play a strong role in helping the body transition to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the scientific evidence is not as robust, large-scale, or consistent as the popularity on social media. Many studies are small, short-duration, or have mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly which form of magnesium works best (glycinate, citrate, oxide, etc.), the ideal dose, and timing before bed are not well established. Some forms have side effects (e.g., digestive upset). Whether sparkling water or prebiotic soda adds anything beyond flavor and enjoyment is likely minimal; the fizz may feel nice, but its sleep-promoting value is not proven. Moreover, tart cherry juice often has sugar; excess sugar before bed could reduce sleep quality or impact metabolic health. So, the quantity, timing, and overall diet still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make the Sleepy Girl Magnesium Mocktail at home?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to try the magnesium mocktail, here’s a simple and easy recipe for you to try at home:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take ½ cup (approx. 4 ounces) of pure tart cherry juice (unsweetened if possible). Add 1 tablespoon of magnesium powder (preferably from a form like glycinate) – check the label for elemental magnesium amount. Top it off with sparkling water or prebiotic soda (small splash) for flavor and texture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Important guidelines and precautions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try drinking it about one hour before bed. This gives time for the body to digest and for calming effects to begin. Avoid adding a lot of sugar. If juice is sweetened, dilute or choose unsweetened to avoid sugar spikes. Start with a modest dose of magnesium (maybe 100-200 mg), especially if you’re not used to supplements. Larger doses increase the risk of stomach upset or loose stool. People with kidney problems, heart issues, or those taking medications (like some antibiotics, diuretics, or heart medications) should consult a doctor first before using magnesium supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; The information in this article is provided for educational and informational purposes only.

Tina Kotek, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green wrote in a joint statement. ‚ÄúThe West Coast Health Alliance stands united in protecting public health and always putting safety before politics.‚Äù &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In Oregon, the new guidelines appear to be a step toward eliminating the requirement that patients obtain a prescription to get the 2025-2026 COVID-19 booster shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Last month, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontechs-comirnatyr-receives-us-fda-approval" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;approved updated COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; from Pfizer and Moderna that were reformulated in the spring to better match the variants currently in circulation. That approval was limited to adults 65 and older, and for people 5 through 64 years with at least one underlying condition that puts them at high risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Typically, the FDA recommendations would come after a public review of the safety and efficacy of the shots by the CDC and a key group of experts known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. But officials at the U.S. Health and Human Services have spent months delaying that step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Guidelines from ACIP for the 2025-2026 COVID-19 booster shots are still pending, which has meant that in Oregon and more than a dozen states, most pharmacies have required a doctor‚Äôs prescription before they will give the COVID-19 shot. The group is set to meet on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Oregon‚Äôs Board of Pharmacy, meanwhile, is holding an emergency meeting on Wednesday at 11:30 a.m. to discuss a change in protocol for vaccine administration around fall respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. That change could allow pharmacists to administer vaccines without a prescription, regardless of what ACIP decides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The recommendations from these four states pit Democratic governors who have promised to provide universal access to updated COVID-19 shots against top federal officials at Health and Human Services who &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;have sought to restrict them&lt;/a&gt; to groups at higher risk, citing practices in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;In recent months, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has come under intense scrutiny for allegations he has ignored staff scientists at the CDC and is using the power of the federal government to pursue an anti-vaccine agenda that he has long held. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;ACIP has been the nation‚Äôs preeminent authority on vaccine safety and efficacy, but the group is mired in controversy after Kennedy dismissed all 17 of its prior members this summer and removed liaisons to major medical organizations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Some new members Kennedy has appointed to ACIP have &lt;a href="https://x.com/RetsefL?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;called for MRNA shots&lt;/a&gt; to be pulled from use and have &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;misrepresented the risks&lt;/a&gt; of infectious diseases, including the measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, has said that recommendations made by the current ACIP committee should be rejected as illegitimate, given the turmoil at the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;On Wednesday, the committee heard testimony from Susan Monarez, the recently ousted director of the CDC, a Trump nominee confirmed by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Monarez told lawmakers that Kennedy demanded she commit in advance to approve all of ACIP‚Äôs recommendations regardless of the scientific evidence, and directed her to fire career vaccine policy officials without cause. She refused and was fired by the White House. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Kennedy has accused Monarez of lying about the events that preceded her firing.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Officials at HHS have called the new members of ACIP highly credentialed doctors, scientists, and public health experts, and said Kennedy reconstituted the committee because its previous members had been too quick to rubber-stamp vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;They lambasted the health alliance, saying that states run by Democrats are the ones who undermined trust in public health through pandemic-era decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;‚ÄúACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic,‚Äù HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a written statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The recommendations from the West Coast Health Alliance include the 2025‚Äì26 COVID-19, influenza and RSV vaccines. The recommendations for the latter two appear to align with current guidelines from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;According to the press release, the recommendations were developed by health officers from the four states. They are based on guidelines issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;Last year, only 20% of Oregonians got the COVID-19 booster shot, &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/oregon.immunization.program/viz/OregonCOVID-19VaccineEffortMetrics_16989688884510/StatewideProgress" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;according to the state health authority&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body__text article-body--padding color_dgray m-none"&gt;The uptake rate was higher among some groups, like those 65 and up and native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, who are at greater risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Oregon Public Broadcasting - OPB</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxNVnNpWEItUUlRakphV3FRLXJpYUNnUmpBRWE4RGR5Zk02TmtablJLVEZORWdESTJzcER4V3NuaFFyVDJONW1hQ2xkM1dDenh3MHRYeFdYWVppMEhxYnRxNWhVUmlpanVSU0xkbU1zMklKd0k0R2xHSGd1RG1iaEt5eWFScHpIVkE1YnJFcnF6WDhvdjViNk94bGhrYVpxeDVBNktUdHF3Q1hBcktlNWhjYlNvOVc</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州和西海岸各州在与疾病预防控制中心的冲突中推出自己的疫苗指南-洛杉矶时报</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-17/california-vaccine-guidance</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-dateline data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;SACRAMENTO — &lt;/span&gt;Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Wednesday giving California the power to set its own immunization schedules based on state health experts and independent medical groups — a sharp break from decades of reliance on guidance from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move came the same day that &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-09-03/california-pushes-back-on-trumps-cdc-with-west-coast-health-alliance"&gt;California and its West Coast allies&lt;/a&gt; issued joint recommendations for COVID-19, flu and RSV vaccines, part of a regional alliance formed to counter what they say is a politicized U.S. Centers for Disease Control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our states are united in putting science, safety, and transparency first — and in protecting families with clear, credible vaccine guidance,” said the governors of California, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii, which make up the West Coast Health Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthcare clash comes following a wave of COVID cases and as the annual flu season nears. For decades, the CDC has been the nation’s trusted authority on vaccines — setting childhood immunization schedules, guiding which shots adults should receive and shaping state health policies across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at the direction of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Trump ally, the CDC fired top leadership, lost senior scientific advisors and remade its vaccine advisory committee with members who the Associated Press found spread misinformation and conspiracy theories about immunizations. That committee, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, is set to meet Thursday and Friday to review — and potentially change — vaccine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, has defended the shakeup as necessary to create trust and “eliminate politics from science.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They deserve the truth and that’s what we’re going to give them for the first time in the history of the agency,” Kennedy told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month during a contentious hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fired CDC chief Susan Monarez told U.S. senators on Wednesday that the United States public health system is headed to a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-09-17/fired-cdc-chief-susan-monarez-warns-senators-that-rfk-jr-is-endangering-public-health"&gt;“very dangerous place” &lt;/a&gt;under Kennedy and that she had been unsuccessfully pressured to sign off on new vaccine recommendations without supporting scientific data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chaos at the CDC triggered a fierce backlash as more than 1,000 employees at the health agency and national health organizations have &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/1000-current-former-hhs-officials-demand-rfk-jrs-resignation-rcna229103" target="_blank"&gt;called on Kennedy to resign&lt;/a&gt;. Some states, however, have embraced the approach — Florida announced plans to become the first state to end all  mandated vaccines, including for schoolchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polarization is taking a toll. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-covid-19-vaccine-update/" target="_blank"&gt;A recent KFF poll&lt;/a&gt; found Americans are increasingly uncertain about public health guidance and whether new recommendations from the administration will make them more or less safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say that not only are vaccines crucial for the health of individuals and the community but they also ultimately save money — preventing sickness and the rise in healthcare costs that would accompany widespread disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes in federal vaccine recommendations have been sweeping. The Food and Drug Administration, which falls under Kennedy’s purview, now requires adults 65 and younger and otherwise healthy — who report no underlying health issues — to consult with a healthcare provider before getting the COVID vaccine. Similarly, the CDC requires parents of healthy children to talk to a healthcare provider before their child can receive the COVID vaccine, a barrier the American Academy of Pediatrics called “deeply troubling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics issued its own COVID vaccine guidance, countering what the CDC recommended, that says all young children 6 months to 23 months should be vaccinated, as well as certain high-risk older children. The group said that older children should be offered the vaccine if their parents request it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also changed its vaccine schedule from recommending the COVID vaccine to all pregnant women to offering “no guidance” as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the vaccine. In response, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that people receive the updated COVID-19 vaccine at any point during their pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California said it too will reject CDC guidance, starting with the recommendations released Wednesday from the West Coast Health Alliance. Those recommendations were developed by health officers and subject matter experts from each state, who considered guidelines from medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 vaccine recommendations from the West Coast Health Alliance include vaccinating all children 6 months to 23 months, all seniors 65 and older and  anyone 2 years old to 64 years old with risk factors. The alliance recommended all pregnant and postpartum women or those planning to become pregnant to be vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance recommended people get vaccinated if they are in close contact with other people who have risk factors for severe illness if they get COVID-19. It was also recommended all children who have never been vaccinated against COVID-19 get a shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those recommendations are slightly different for adults issued from the American Academy of Family Physicians, which recommends all adults get the updated COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alliance recommended that children 6 months and older and all adults and pregnant women  receive the flu shot. For the RSV vaccine, the alliance recommends it for children younger than 8 months, as well as anyone 75 years or older. The alliance recommends the RSV vaccine for people age 50 to 74 if a person has risk factors and for pregnant women between 32 weeks and 36 weeks of gestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and clinical associate professor at Stanford School of Medicine, said the recommendations from the West Coast Health Alliance sends a clear message to residents that their state governments “will not allow them to become victims of federal scientific incompetence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It tells families that when they ask their doctors about vaccines for their children, those recommendations will still be based on decades of rigorous research and clinical evidence, not on whatever political winds are blowing in Washington,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Newsom’s signature on Assembly Bill 144, the state overhauled its law that referenced the CDC’s current recommendations as the basis for which immunizations are covered by health insurance. Those recommendations will now be made by a larger group of medical associations and the  national vaccine advisory committee’s guidance as of Jan. 1, 2025 — which was prior to Kennedy‘s being sworn in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new law allows the California Department of Public Health to modify or expand the list of recommended immunizations with input from medical and scientific organizations. It also extends liability protections for any vaccine injury caused by “omission in prescribing, dispensing, ordering, furnishing, or in the administration of a vaccine or other immunizing agents” for any shots required by state law or done in accordance to the state’s recommendations. That liability waiver, which would be in effect until 2030, does not include willful misconduct or gross negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want the people who live and work in our states to know that there is a strong public health, healthcare and scientific community that will continue to stand together to provide and use the data and evidence needed for you to make healthy choices, and we are here to protect our communities,” said Dr. Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flurry of vaccine actions came as lawmakers and the University of California proposed a $23-billion ballot measure to replace federal research dollars lost to Trump-era cuts, underscoring efforts by Democrats in the state to shield science and public health from shifting federal policies. Senate Bill 607, if passed by the California Legislature when lawmakers return in January, would go before voters in November 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At UCLA, the Trump administration has suspended more than half a billion dollars in research grants and demanded the university pay a $1.2-billion fine over allegations of antisemitism and civil rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The loss of critical federal funding awarded to the University of California presents an unprecedented and perilous moment for the state and its communities,” Theresa Maldonado, UC vice president for research and innovation, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Times staff writer Rong-Gong Lin contributed to this report.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 22:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxPZTJIUnc2SC1sR1lWRDhHT3BjYTRDa09hZ3djOEc0MmdTYUVxNWthZDZZN1Y5clJTN2lLMG9raEVjczVsZzRUaTlTd25YaWloazNDaVFUSmNkTWVUbTFHcFFvaEtPLTdxcGcyLXQyMjMzN1hNZW9TSzdsRDFuaXhLVVVaOU5nZw</guid></item><item><title>我测试了几十个健康贴士- 4如此不同，多年后我仍然发誓- Everygirl</title><link>https://theeverygirl.com/wellness-products-that-actually-work/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Everygirl</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 22:21:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5sQTlocXcxZHNxWWtsbTRyN0xwalJTY0dtTHctUnN5eGZHSHpOeFhYM2RwaUR6dVpkOEROZDJkdzFaU1l3QlRYUG9sNG91YU9Mb2lJNGZBYVR4SHF2LTc2LVJ1em9KcE9CalA2aGo4UQ</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.对疫苗政策的最大破坏即将到来- vox.com</title><link>https://www.vox.com/health/461858/cdc-susan-monarez-rfk-jr-vaccine-guidelines</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="zephr-anchor" class="_1agbrix10"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This morning, ousted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Susan Monarez came to the Senate to share her story of being fired by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and President Donald Trump, the latest volley in an ongoing battle between the Trump administration and the public health establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;According to Monarez’s testimony, the upcoming meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) — which will take place over the next two days — had been the impetus for her ouster. She testified that, during a contentious meeting with Kennedy before she was fired, he asked her to approve, sight unseen, the new vaccine recommendations that would be made by his new ACIP. The panel is now staffed by experts who were handpicked by Kennedy, who also asked her to fire career CDC vaccine scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;During her testimony before the Senate health committee, Monarez maintained composure as many Republican senators sought to cast doubt on her credibility. But the committee chair, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), who is also a trained physician, was a counter-force: He issued his own warning about unjustified changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, particularly the hepatitis B shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And now, what could be the real breaking point for Kennedy’s Make America Healthy agenda is here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At tomorrow’s and Friday’s meetings, the ACIP will discuss possible changes to the childhood vaccine schedule and the federal government’s guidance for the Covid-19 and hepatitis B vaccines and for measles-mumps-rubella shots. The guidance for hepatitis B shots, in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-committee-meeting-infants.html"&gt;may be changed&lt;/a&gt;, and emerged as a flashpoint at Wednesday’s hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-rift-over-the-hepatitis-b-vaccine-briefly-explained" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The rift over the hepatitis B vaccine, briefly explained&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;How did the hepatitis B shot suddenly become so central in this debate? It’s long been a target of anti-vaccine activists because it is given within the first day of a child’s life. And in today’s Senate hearing, some Republicans sounded on board with making changes: Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) suggested that the timing of the vaccine, which is currently offered to newborn babies, should be pushed back. He argued that unless the mother is known to have hepatitis B, giving the vaccine that early was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;At the end of the hearing, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA), the committee chair, offered a rebuke: He noted that a child infected at birth with hepatitis B has a more than 90 percent chance of developing a chronic infection — and he pointed out that the US used to see &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-committee-meeting-infants.html"&gt;20,000 babies infected by hepatitis B every year&lt;/a&gt;, before the vaccine became standard in the early 1990s. Now it’s less than 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“That,” he emphasized, “is an accomplishment to make America healthy again. And we should stand up and salute the people who made the decision, because there are people who would otherwise be dead if their mothers weren’t given the choice of that vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Cassidy also underscored that the CDC does not &lt;em&gt;mandate&lt;/em&gt; the hepatitis B vaccine; it only requires the insurance company to pay for the shot — and that’s only if the parents want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Now that we’ve controlled [hepatitis B], do we let the genie out of the bottle?” he asked, observing that if the ACIP removes the recommendation for newborns to get the hepatitis B shot, health insurers may no longer cover the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Today’s hearing with the former CDC director didn’t result in widespread calls for Kennedy’s resignation. But the opposition to his aggressive overhaul of vaccine policy has been building for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY)&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU-ijk73OF0"&gt; grilled Kennedy over the value of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; at another hearing earlier this month. Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/16/gop-lawmakers-dont-sound-enthused-about-rfk-jr-00564704"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on a growing ambivalence among other GOP lawmakers, too. But Kennedy still has a lot of allies in his corner; except for Cassidy and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), most of the Republican questions for Monarez at the Wednesday hearing were hostile and sought to cast doubt on her credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But Cassidy could really escalate the situation. He’s always been the most closely watched Republican senator when it comes to Kennedy and the MAHA agenda. He’s the health committee chair, and because he’s a trained physician, he has a lot of credibility among experts and the public. If he wants to make life difficult for Kennedy, he can — by investigating the health agency, calling for more testimony, and opposing his agenda on the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now Cassidy has all but issued a warning to ACIP and Kennedy against making an unjustified change to the hepatitis B vaccine guidance.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Swedish-led research team at Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital has shown in a new randomized clinical trial that a low dose of the well-known medicine aspirin halves the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colon and rectal cancer with a certain type of genetic alteration in the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Every year, nearly two million people worldwide are diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colorectal+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Between 20 and 40% develop metastases, which makes the disease both more difficult to treat and more deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous observational studies have suggested that aspirin may reduce the risk of certain cancers and possibly also the risk of recurrence after surgery in patients with colorectal cancer harboring mutations in genes within the PIK3 signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These genes regulate key cellular processes such as growth and division. When mutated, these processes can become dysregulated, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer development. However, prior findings have been inconsistent and no &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/randomized+clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;randomized clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; had previously confirmed the association. To address this gap, the ALASCCA trial was initiated and has now been &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study included more than 3,500 patients with colon and rectal cancer from 33 hospitals in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Patients whose tumors showed a specific genetic mutation in the PIK3 signaling pathway—a mutation found in approximately 40% of patients—were randomized to receive either 160 mg of aspirin daily or a placebo for three years after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;For patients with the genetic mutation in PIK3, the risk of recurrence was reduced by 55% in those who received aspirin compared with the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is being tested here in a completely new context as a precision medicine treatment. This is a clear example of how we can use &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+information/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic information&lt;/a&gt; to personalize treatment and at the same time save both resources and suffering," says first author Anna Martling, professor at the Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, and senior consultant surgeon at Karolinska University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does aspirin reduce the risk of recurrence of colon and rectal cancer? The researchers believe that the effect is likely due to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/aspirin/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;aspirin&lt;/a&gt; acting through several parallel mechanisms—it reduces inflammation, inhibits platelet function and tumor growth. This combination makes the environment less favorable for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although we do not yet fully understand all the molecular links, the findings strongly support the biological rationale and suggest that the treatment may be particularly effective in genetically defined subgroups of patients," says Martling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that the results could have global significance and influence treatment guidelines for colon and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rectal+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. Martling sees the fact that the drug is well established as a major advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Aspirin is a drug that is readily available globally and extremely inexpensive compared to many modern cancer drugs, which is very positive," says Martling.&lt;/p&gt;

About 40% of colorectal cancer patients have such mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think this will change clinical practice,” said Prof Anna Martling, who led the &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en/mmk/research/colorectal-surgery/alascca/alascca-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Alascca trial&lt;/a&gt; at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. “If you had these mutations, the risk of the cancer coming back was lowered by more than 50%. It is a huge effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Nearly 2 million people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year around the world, with more than 40,000 cases in the UK. Many have their tumours removed, but despite advances in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, the cancer can return if cells are left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rates of bowel cancer are rising worldwide &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/bowel-cancer-rising-under-50s-worldwide-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;in people under 50&lt;/a&gt;, and while the reasons are unclear, scientists suspect junk food, obesity, a lack of physical activity and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/23/childhood-toxin-exposure-may-be-factor-in-bowel-cancer-rise-in-under-50s" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;toxins produced by gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/mar/20/cancer-drugs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Previous trials&lt;/a&gt; have shown aspirin can help to prevent colorectal cancer in people who are high risk because of hereditary conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/20/gamechanging-bowel-cancer-screening-offered-to-people-with-lynch-syndrome-in-england" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Lynch syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. But it was unclear whether the drug reduced the chances of cancer recurring after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Martling and her colleagues recruited more than 3,500 patients who had had colorectal tumours removed at hospitals in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland. Genetic tests on 2,980 of the patients found 1,103, or 37%, had mutations in genes that make up a biological pathway called PI3K, which is implicated in colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The patients with the mutations were randomly assigned to have 160mg aspirin a day or a placebo for three years after surgery. Those on aspirin were 55% less likely to have the cancer return than those on placebo, the trial showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The drug appears to protect against cancer by dampening down inflammation, interfering with the PI3K pathway, and dampening down the activity of blood platelets, which can surround tumour cells and effectively hide them from the patient’s immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Martling said the results emphasised the need to run genetic tests on all colorectal cancers so patients who stood to benefit from aspirin could be given the drug. “It’s a widely available drug that is extremely inexpensive,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aspirin has been on the market for more than a century, but taking the drug long-term still has risks. In the trial, four patients had “severe adverse events” potentially linked to aspirin, including allergic reaction, gastrointestinal bleeding and bleeding on the brain. Four patients died across both arms of the trial, with one fatality possibly caused by aspirin. Details are published in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2504650" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Catherine Elliott, director of research at &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK, said: “Preventing cancer cases saves lives, and finding new ways to do this is key to our efforts to beat cancer. There is increasing evidence that in certain groups of people, low-dose aspirin can offer protection from bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The Cancer Research UK-funded CaPP3 trial showed a similar effect in people living with Lynch Syndrome, an inherited condition that increases the risk of bowel and other cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We need larger, high-quality studies like CaPP3 and this recent research to confirm who would most benefit from taking aspirin to help them live longer, better lives, free from the fear of cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxOT2hCdEdYdzZ5cGdjSHJOMVJBR1MyNHRzUzVrTi1yRUVrQjhiOFFRUFpGdG13ZUJSMEVrTm5QVDZxSkFTeXZNRnpoN0tLX2M2Yk9HdE0tZEF4RTFTeVJkZ2ROSWF5RUJHdDdDRHoxWmdZNFh2aXNUb3E4ZGVDejFXQ01PRVdsLVdFOFlSZFhGclNwMWNkMExzLVRHZjhyVC1IUmR5aG41Qkhtc05ORFNJVWtXRmhLdW0zM1drOVo1SXRGb0RpX3BZ</guid></item><item><title>在疫苗接种推出期间，新冠肺炎病例蔓延-匹兹堡邮报</title><link>https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2025/09/17/covid-19-vaccine-cases-allegheny-county-pennsylvania/stories/202509160085</link><description>&lt;body class="pgevoke bs-grid pg-hasicomoon pg-site-pg pg-user-checkingstatus pg-requesttype-story pgevoke-pageparentsection-news pg-piano" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Seasonal vaccination is also a critical public health tool to reduce serious illness, community transmission, and strain on hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want the people who live and work in our states to know that there is a strong public health, healthcare &amp;amp; scientific community that will continue to stand together to provide and use the data and evidence needed for you to make healthy choices, and we are here to protect our communities.” &lt;strong&gt;– Dr. Erica Pan, Director of the California Department of Public Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines remain a critical tool to prevent severe illness and death. In a void of federal leadership, our four states are stepping forward to provide clear, consistent recommendations our communities can trust. Our commitment is to ensure that our shared guidance is rooted in science and that vaccines people want and need are accessible to all. Public health depends on clarity, equity, and transparency—and that is what we’re delivering today.&lt;strong&gt;” – Dr. Sejal Hathi, MD, MBA, Director, Oregon Health Authority&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines protect more than just ourselves — they help safeguard our families, neighbors, and communities. By staying up to date, Washingtonians can reduce the spread of illness and keep our state strong this season. The Alliance’s recommendations are rooted in science, giving our communities confidence in the guidance we provide.” –&lt;strong&gt; Washington State Secretary of Health Dennis Worsham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The effectiveness of public health institutions depends on the public’s trust. We understand our responsibility to earn that trust by helping people protect themselves, their families and their community. These recommendations represent a collaborative effort, done with humility and based on science, to meet our responsibilities to our communities and the public at large.”&lt;strong&gt; – Kenneth S. Fink, MD, MGA, MPH, Director, Hawai&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ʻ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i Department of Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Truth under assault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has aggressively weaponized the CDC by purging its vaccine advisory committee, firing all 17 members and replacing them with cherry-picked appointees who include vaccine skeptics. He’s forced out the CDC director, triggered high-level and career-staff resignations, and scheduled expedited meetings where this reshaped panel will vote on critical recommendations that guide national vaccine policy and insurance coverage. Public health leaders warn these moves dismantle independent, science-based oversight and inject politics into decisions that protect Americans’ health — undermining the CDC’s credibility at a moment when trust and clarity are most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;States stepping in &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alliance states are fighting back against the Trump administration’s assault on science — sharing a commitment to ensuring that health recommendations are guided by safety, efficacy, transparency, access, and trust. To develop these recommendations, Health Officers, who are all medical doctors, and subject matter experts from each of the WCHA states reviewed guidelines from credible national medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). Our alliance believes that all clinically recommended vaccinations should be accessible to the people of our states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WCHA will continue to build its structure, evaluate new evidence and recommendations as they become available, and determine how to ensure the review process is transparent. WCHA is committed to sharing any updated assessments with our communities.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A new study by Duke researchers marked a major shift in
understanding one of the deadliest forms of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, researchers released a new &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09503-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that found
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) likely begins in basal stem-like cells rather
than in specialized lung cells called neuroendocrine cells.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The study suggests basal cells can “give rise to tumors in
both the classic neuroendocrine form and a tuft-like form.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This discovery reshapes our understanding of how small cell
lung cancer begins,” said the study’s senior author, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fmedschool.duke.edu*2Fprofile*2Ftrudy-g-oliver/1/010001995831ac35-72da1b03-a17d-4ee7-900b-b20847cd2f8a-000000/5Ow80nU5O_SahUl4TO7YavDOfJ0=444__;JSUlJQ!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!Ff2CRBIcDjfPe4qyOoHfj_Ig94XRksrxE_EIIW-FT0QRfroacnGMHMaqYy4Hmi6OoQkrNfOKHQ$"&gt;Trudy
G. Oliver, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, professor in the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fpcb.duke.edu*2F/1/010001995831ac35-72da1b03-a17d-4ee7-900b-b20847cd2f8a-000000/Qq00kt6zjckS1BELCfOA33kAMfw=444__;JSUl!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!Ff2CRBIcDjfPe4qyOoHfj_Ig94XRksrxE_EIIW-FT0QRfroacnGMHMaqYy4Hmi6OoQmqu8ZCRg$"&gt;Department
of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/zwly9k6z.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:*2F*2Fmedschool.duke.edu*2F/1/010001995831ac35-72da1b03-a17d-4ee7-900b-b20847cd2f8a-000000/683r2GjotLiTAr1oTEv_7QSsSi0=444__;JSUl!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!Ff2CRBIcDjfPe4qyOoHfj_Ig94XRksrxE_EIIW-FT0QRfroacnGMHMaqYy4Hmi6OoQkmEKrAjg$"&gt;Duke
University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The “tuft-like form” is connected to poor patient outcomes
and resistance to current treatment. Researchers said this new discovery allows
them to explore new strategies to prevent the disease before it takes over the
immune system and spreads.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Our models, for the first time, reflect the full complexity
of the disease, allowing us to study and target its most dangerous forms,”
Oliver said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Researchers said that by using genetically engineered mice,
3-dimensional tumor organoids, and the largest available dataset of human SCLC
tumors, they were able to determine that the tuft-like tumors were triggered
when genetic changes were introduced into basal cells, not neuroendocrine
cells.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“We used a technique called lineage barcoding that allowed
us to tag individual cells and track how they evolve over time,” said the
study’s first author, Abbie S. Ireland, a graduate student in the Molecular
Cancer Biology program at Duke University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Ireland said the study showed that small cell lung cancer
cells can change or shapeshift through a process scientists call “fate
plasticity,” which she said “helps explain why the disease resists treatment
and could provide new approaches for how we might block their transition into
aggressive cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;SCLC makes up 10 to 15% of all lung cancers, according to
the American Cancer Society, with about 30,000 diagnoses every year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The cancer is known for growing faster than other types and
has often spread to other parts of the body before it is diagnosed. The ACS
reports that the SCLC 5-year survival rate is less than 10%, due to its
aggressive nature.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Oliver said this discovery now opens opportunities for
scientists to explore how the immune system interacts with these basal cells
before they transform into aggressive cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;“That opens the door to therapies that could stop the
disease before it even starts,” Oliver said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Gus Saltonstall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new ketamine treatment center opened this week on the Upper West Side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keta Medical Center has opened its doors at 123 West 86th Street, between Columbus and Amsterdam avenues. The new location is Keta Medical Center’s second on the Upper West Side, as there is also an outpost at 7 West 96th Street, between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“New Yorkers deserve access to innovative, safe, and effective options that go beyond traditional medications,” said Dr. Haviva Malina, Co-Founder of Keta Medical Center, in a news release. “By opening our second Upper West Side clinic, we’re making it easier for patients to find relief and reclaim their lives with care that fits their schedules and needs.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keta Medical Center bills itself as a place that “empowers those left behind by traditional treatments to finally realize mental health relief, and rediscover the joy of living life fully.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ketamine was first approved in the 1970s by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an anesthetic during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more recent years, ketamine has begun to be used as a treatment for depression. As outlined by the &lt;a href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/ketamine-treatment-depression-what-you-need-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Columbia University Irving Medical Center,&lt;/a&gt; “ketamine was later found to have rapid-acting antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects,” through its targeting of different neurotransmitters in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In lower doses, it is a form of hallucinogen that can make a person feel detached from reality and enter a dreamlike state,” &lt;a href="https://drugfree.org/drugs/what-is-ketamine/?utm_term=what%20is%20ketamine&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Lead+Generation&amp;amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;amp;hsa_acc=4449235478&amp;amp;hsa_cam=20618265783&amp;amp;hsa_grp=166574456060&amp;amp;hsa_ad=708455346129&amp;amp;hsa_src=g&amp;amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-1583976420&amp;amp;hsa_kw=what%20is%20ketamine&amp;amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=20618265783&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD_EJxWdm_yYJH-IHLMrz27ieAPz_&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwuKnGBhD5ARIsAD19RsaD85jWUUlS6PrbYzlN_k8kJo-iOssgaDtrr5uPdTMLwrF2Ij01oZgaAudUEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to DrugFree.org.&lt;/a&gt; Ketamine can also have side effects, such as dissociation or temporary increases in blood pressure during or shortly after a therapy session, along with nausea and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Keta Medical Center, including the new Upper West Side outpost, each session is supervised by registered nurses and overseen by an emergency room physician. The clinics accept most commercial insurance plans and Medicare, and are open throughout the week from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;A new military playbook could help leaders prevent life-threatening muscle breakdowns in American troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/rhabdo/about/index.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;Exertional rhabdomyolysis&lt;/a&gt;, known as "rhabdo," is a serious medical condition brought on by physical exertion or even heat exposure, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and it has sidelined hundreds of US troops in recent years, prompting the military to look closely at how to spot it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhabdo occurs when damaged muscle tissues release proteins and electrolytes into the bloodstream, damaging organs. Symptoms, which can mimic those of other heat-related illnesses, include nausea and vomiting, kidney damage, heart arrhythmias, and in some cases death or permanent disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it can look like other common illnesses, exertional rhabdomyolysis can be tricky to diagnose and easily missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Francis O'Connor, a professor of military and emergency medicine, said in a military news release that new policy changes will help protect troops and speed up recovery times with clearer diagnostic criteria and better ways to identify at-risk troops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troops most at-risk include those with excessively &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22692-creatine-kinase-ck" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;elevated muscle enzymes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15315-compartment-syndrome" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;muscle compartment syndrome,&lt;/a&gt; kidney issues, or &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.army.mil/article/241176/army_now_testing_recruits_for_sickle_cell_trait" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;sickle cell trait&lt;/a&gt;, which the Army tests for. More mild cases can be managed outside the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. David DeGroot, director of the Army Heat Center, said that his team "frequently" sees exertional rhabdomyolysis cases, with heat illnesses and on its own. The new clinical practice guidelines that the military has not only help spot this condition, but it also gives providers a resource to get injured troops back to work "as quickly as possible" without putting their health at risk, he added.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The US military has waged serious campaigns against heat-related illnesses for years, especially throughout the Global War on Terror as troops fought frequently in hot climates overseas. Most military bases today mark weather conditions with colored flags, in part to alert troops to hot temperatures that could prove unsafe for outdoor training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhabdo, meanwhile, has garnered less attention, despite a recent uptick in military cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Defense Health Agency report published in 2024 found an increase in military &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/05/14/marines-suffer-most-cases-of-2-life-threatening-conditions-related-exercise-and-heat-report-finds.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;rhabdo cases&lt;/a&gt; over the preceding four years, with nearly 530 troops suffering from the condition during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, a US Navy SEAL made &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/tufts-lacrosse-navy-seal.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;headlines&lt;/a&gt; after leading an unsanctioned workout for his alma mater's lacrosse team, putting 24 of 61 students in the hospital, all were diagnosed with rhabdo.

These symptoms often co-occur, persist across childhood, and strongly relate to challenges with sleep, communication, behavior, and sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings underscore the need for clinicians and families to proactively address gut health as part of comprehensive autism care. By treating even unexplained GI symptoms, children may experience improvements in well-being and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Symptoms:&lt;/strong&gt; Autistic children had more frequent and lasting gastrointestinal issues than peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wider Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Gut problems were tied to sleep, mood, communication, and sensory challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care Priority:&lt;/strong&gt; Treating GI symptoms could improve quality of life and developmental outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Children diagnosed with autism are far more likely to experience ongoing gastrointestinal (GI) problems than their typically developing peers. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the finding of  a new UC Davis MIND Institute study published in&lt;em&gt; Autism&lt;/em&gt;. The research also found that these stomach and digestive issues are linked to greater challenges with sleep, communication, sensory processing and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112859"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a gut and a child." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/09/asd-microbiome-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Although gastrointestinal problems in autism have been reported before, this study is the first analysis of GI symptoms in autistic kids from early to middle childhood. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study followed 475 children between the ages of 2 and 12, including 322 children with autism and 153 with typical development. Families participated in detailed physician-led interviews at multiple time points. This allowed researchers to track both the frequency and persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms throughout childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that autistic children were not only more likely to report GI problems, but they were also more likely to have multiple symptoms at once. It was also more likely for these symptoms to persist over many years. Importantly, these symptoms often did not have an identified medical cause. This highlights the need for clinicians and families to pay closer attention to children’s overall health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The connection between autism and gut symptoms has not been fully understood. Parents often sense that their child is having digestive issues, but can’t tell what is causing them,” said Bibiana Restrepo, the lead author of the study. She is a developmental pediatrician and a professor in the Department of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that these symptoms are common, persistent, and can affect many areas of a child’s daily life. By identifying and treating them, we may be able to improve both physical comfort and developmental outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stomach problems beyond digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers evaluated nine common gastrointestinal symptoms, including constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating. While occasional digestive issues are common in all children, the study revealed striking differences between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children with autism had more GI symptoms at every age studied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They were more likely to experience multiple GI symptoms at the same time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Their GI symptoms were more likely to persist across childhood, rather than resolve quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms were strongly associated with other health and behavioral challenges. Children with more frequent GI issues also showed higher rates of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;sleep difficulties&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;anxiety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;irritability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;communication challenges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sensory sensitivities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;repetitive behaviors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a reminder that the brain and the body are deeply connected,” said the study’s senior author Christine Wu Nordahl. Nordahl is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and directs the Autism Phenome Project at the MIND Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When children are experiencing stomach pain or other GI problems, it doesn’t just affect digestion. It can influence sleep, mood, and how they interact with the world around them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing common gut issues for children with autism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although gastrointestinal problems in autism have been reported before, this study is the first analysis of GI symptoms in autistic kids from early to middle childhood. It is also among the largest and most rigorous to track these symptoms over a decade of childhood development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize that many GI symptoms are treatable, even when they don’t have an obvious medical diagnosis. Increased awareness among clinicians, educators and families can help ensure children get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For parents, this study validates what many have long observed: that GI symptoms are very common in children with autism,” Restrepo said. “Clinicians should ask about these issues in routine visits, because effective treatment may help children feel better and thrive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team hopes their findings will lead to greater collaboration between pediatricians, gastroenterologists and autism specialists. By addressing GI health as part of comprehensive autism care, children may gain relief from symptoms that interfere with their growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not about finding a single cause,” Nordahl added. “It’s about recognizing the whole child. Supporting gastrointestinal health is one important step toward improving overall quality of life for children with autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and the UC Davis MIND Institute. It was also supported by the MIND Institute Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this autism research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cda3b4a8a5b4ac8da5a8aca1b9a5e3b8aea9acbba4bee3a8a9b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Nadine Yehya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucdavis.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;UC Davis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nadine Yehya – UC Davis&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13623613251362349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A longitudinal evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder&lt;/a&gt;” by Bibiana Restrepo et al. &lt;em&gt;Autism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A longitudinal evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in children with autism spectrum disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently reported in children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.

A rigorous symptom classification was performed by physicians via clinical consensus. The frequency and persistence of gastrointestinal symptoms across childhood were compared between groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations between gastrointestinal symptoms and measures of internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sleep problems, sensory problems, restricted and repetitive behaviors, and social communication were also evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with autism presented with more gastrointestinal symptoms at each time point, and they were also more likely to experience multiple and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence and number of gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with greater impairment in internalizing behaviors, sleep, communication, sensory processing, and repetitive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants in the autism spectrum disorder group reported more gastrointestinal symptoms without known etiology throughout childhood in this longitudinal well-characterized sample.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2025 20:06:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBLRmZqZ21tckRRcVA1S2U3WmxyZVRQMHhZaUo1SmQ4MHp1a1NjdW8yenBCWlZKQlJjQ0RoZmpRU3hVUnVwLVdoeFBaYjJuRFJQS3JiUVhZbk9GZ2VRb0FkNkRUeFJudkhmd3hEVGptQQ</guid></item><item><title>维生素B3可以帮助预防皮肤癌。以下是可能受益人-美国国家公共广播电台</title><link>https://www.npr.org/2025/09/17/nx-s1-5544145/vitamin-b3-can-help-protect-against-skin-cancer-heres-who-may-benefit</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Doctors who perform skin cancer surgeries often recommend nicotinamide — which is a form of Vitamin B3 — to their patients. It's been shown to protect cells from UV radiation damage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, a new study of nearly 34,000 veterans, finds this over-the-counter supplement is linked to a reduction in non-melanoma skin cancers among people who've already had skin cancer. The research was&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/article-abstract/2838591" target="_blank"&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Dermatology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The biggest reduction was seen among people who began taking the supplement after being diagnosed with their first skin cancer. Researchers found those who took 500 mg of nicotinamide, also known as niacinamide, twice daily, for at least one month, had a 54% reduced risk of developing another skin cancer, compared to patients who did not take the supplement.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Overall, the reduction in skin cancer risk, across all the participants, was about 14 percent. The reduction was seen in non-melanoma skin cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, which is the most common, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The biggest reduction was in squamous cell cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very surprised at the degree of risk reduction," says &lt;a href="https://dermatology.vumc.org/lee-e-wheless" target="_blank"&gt;study author Dr. Lee Wheless&lt;/a&gt;, of Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a staff physician at the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System VA Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Evidence to support the potential benefits of B3 supplements to protect against skin cancer goes back a decade. The results of a randomized clinical trial in Australia published in 2015 that included 386 people with a history of non-melanoma skin cancers pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1506197" target="_blank"&gt;reduced risk of new skin cancers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The 2015 findings led many doctors to recommend B3 supplements to their patients. A survey of 1,500 doctors who perform Mohs surgery — a precise procedure to remove skin cancers — found &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33625146/" target="_blank"&gt;77% recommend &lt;/a&gt;nicotinamide. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sarah Arron is a dermatologist in the San Francisco Bay area, who performs surgery on people with skin cancers. She was not involved in the study. Arron had been on the fence about when to recommend Vitamin B3 to her patients. Now, she says the new study provides stronger evidence and adds more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The growing body of literature suggests that we should routinely recommend nicotinamide as secondary prevention for all patients with skin cancer and that earlier initiation will have a stronger effect," Arron wrote in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2838594" target="_blank"&gt;an editorial &lt;/a&gt;on the study, which was published alongside the study in JAMA Dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Arron says the supplement is widely available over the counter and has "minimal adverse effects." She says people should buy the form of the supplement that ends in "amide", rather than niacin (nicotinic acid) which is another form of B3 that does not have the same effects.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I am going to be more rigorous in recommending it to patients, especially patients who are having their first skin cancer. I think the benefit is strongest if we start it early," Arron told NPR. She says the supplement was less effective at preventing skin cancer among participants in the study who began taking B3 after they had already been diagnosed with multiple skin cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She points out that more than $8 billion is spent each year to treat skin cancers in the U.S., and she says people tend to underestimate the impact of non-melanoma cancers. Squamous cell skin cancers are very treatable, and are often removed when detected early, but they can spread to other parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One unanswered question is whether B3 supplements are beneficial for people who have never been diagnosed with skin cancer.  Arron says more research is needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It is certainly possible that somebody who is at higher risk for skin cancer, who's already showing signs of precancerous change in the skin, might benefit from nicotinamide," she says. "But we'll have to do those studies to see."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says Vitamin B3 has been shown to help protect cells from UV radiation damage.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lots of skin care products, from cleansers to serums to moisturizers include B3, which is marketed as an ingredient to help improve skin tone and texture. There may be aesthetic benefits for the skin, but Arron says it's unclear if these topical products would have any influence on cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

"Meanwhile, the pain—shooting, stabbing, constricting pain—was getting worse. At some level, I knew what was happening: my brain was damaged."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She was taken to the hospital for a brain scan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The diagnosis was quick and ominous: a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a life-threatening type of stroke, caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain," the Emmy nominee added. "I’d had an &lt;a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1338345/emilia-clarke-says-shes-missing-parts-of-her-brain-after-surviving-2-aneurysms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;aneurysm&lt;/a&gt;, an arterial rupture."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emilia had immediate surgery to seal the aneurysm, calling the pain "unbearable." While she was recovering, she continued, she experienced aphasia and was "muttering nonsense."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A week later, "the aphasia passed," Emilia added, and she left the hospital a month after being admitted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a 2013 brain scan, she learned a growth "doubled in size" and that she needed surgery again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"When they woke me, I was screaming in pain," she wrote. "The procedure had failed. I had a massive bleed and the doctors made it plain that my chances of surviving were precarious if they didn’t operate again. This time they needed to &lt;a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1025613/emilia-clarke-reveals-she-survived-2-life-threatening-brain-aneurysms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;access my brain&lt;/a&gt; in the old-fashioned way—through my skull."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thankfully, Emilia shared, she's now "at a hundred per cent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>E!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An annual &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf528/8254054"&gt;&lt;span&gt;study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; published this week in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; reveals the heavy burden and considerable costs of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in adults aged 75 years and older and high-risk people 65 to 74 years old in France.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers at Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere and RSV vaccine manufacturer Moderna in Paris parsed data on RSV hospitalizations, including stays in the intensive care unit (ICU), on patients aged 65 and 74 with chronic respiratory disease or congestive heart failure and those 75 and older. Data were from the French National Hospital Discharge database. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was conducted from 2017 to 2022, before approval of RSV vaccines in France. A correction factor derived from virologic data from two hospitals was used to adjust for underreporting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Hospitalizations are frequently underreported due to diagnostic challenges and a lack of standardized testing," the authors wrote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;True burden underreported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A total of 353 RSV hospitalizations occurred at two hospitals during the study period. Over half (54.1%) of patients were 65 and older, 52.1% were women, and 28.3% had at least one ICU stay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The significant burden of RSV on adults aged 75+ and high-risk adults aged 65-74 with chronic conditions remains underreported.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among adults aged 75 and older, the adjusted incidence of RSV hospitalization was 85 to 221 per 100,000 people, death rates among hospitalized patients were 8.9% to 10.4%, and annual adjusted costs were €27 million to €76 million ($32 million to $90 million US), mainly driven by ICU admissions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In total, 12.1% to 18.5% of patients in the older group were admitted to the ICU, and 33.5% to 37.7% were readmitted to the hospital within 3 months, mainly for respiratory (6.8% to 9.9%) or cardiorespiratory (11.3% to 16.0%) conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Adults aged 65 to 74 also had higher adjusted rates of RSV infection (161 to 735 per 100,000 people), along with elevated rates of ICU admission and disproportionately higher costs due to intensive-care needs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The significant burden of RSV on adults aged 75+ and high-risk adults aged 65-74 with chronic conditions remains underreported," the researchers wrote. "Improved diagnostics and targeted vaccination programs are essential to reduce hospitalizations, mortality, and healthcare costs in these vulnerable groups."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
