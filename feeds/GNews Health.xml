			&lt;p&gt;The levels of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; in your blood could affect the amount of body fat you carry, a factor that in turn could determine your risk of developing type 2 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those are the findings of a 2023 study that used genetic markers to establish a more definitive link between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="160058" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; levels, BMI, and type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="160058" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, the University of Bristol in the UK, and Imperial College London in the UK, said calorie-free caffeinated drinks could be explored as a potential means of helping reduce body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with lower BMI and whole body fat mass," the researchers &lt;a href="https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000335"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper, published in March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, genetically predicted higher plasma caffeine concentrations were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Approximately half of the effect of caffeine on type 2 diabetes liability was estimated to be mediated through BMI reduction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eqbRU-59e54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved data from just under 10,000 people collected from existing genetic databases, focusing on variations in or near specific genes known to be associated with the speed at which caffeine is broken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, those with variations affecting the genes – namely &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYP1A2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a gene that regulates it, called &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=AHR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – tend to break caffeine down more slowly, allowing it to remain in the blood longer. Yet they also tend to drink less caffeine in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; was used to determine likely causal relationships between the presence of the variations, illnesses like diabetes, body mass, and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg" alt="Three coffees being held by hands" class="size-full wp-image-141100" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Caffeine in your blood may help determine your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. (&lt;a href="https://pixabay.com/photos/coffee-drink-friends-latte-2565441/"&gt;StockSnap/Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a significant link between caffeine levels, BMI, and type 2 diabetes risk, no relationship emerged between the amount of caffeine in the blood and cardiovascular diseases including atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked a moderate and relative increase in caffeine consumption to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/four-cups-of-coffee-a-day-might-be-the-perfect-amount-of-your-heart"&gt;better heart health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2018.1507996"&gt;a lower BMI&lt;/a&gt;, and this research adds more detail to what we already know about the effects that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="103693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; has on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LoTgfGotaQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to also keep in mind the impacts of caffeine on the body &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/all-the-ways-caffeine-affects-your-body-in-one-handy-infographic"&gt;aren't all positive&lt;/a&gt;, which means &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-eye-opening-medical-case-reveals-what-can-happen-when-you-overdose-on-caffeine"&gt;care must be taken&lt;/a&gt; when weighing up the benefits of drinking it – but this latest study is an important step in assessing how much caffeine is ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Small, short term trials have shown that caffeine intake results in weight and fat mass reduction, but the long term effects of caffeine intake is unknown," the researchers &lt;a href="https://bmjmedicine.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000335"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Considering the extensive intake of caffeine worldwide, even its small metabolic effects could have important health implications."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team thinks the association shown here could be down to the way caffeine increases thermogenesis (&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/our-muscles-evolved-a-clever-way-to-keep-us-warm-even-when-theyre-doing-nothing"&gt;heat production&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-before-exercising-does-something-pretty-awesome-to-your-body"&gt;fat oxidation&lt;/a&gt; (turning fat into energy) in the body, which both play an important role in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-expert-reveals-3-ways-you-can-speed-up-your-metabolism"&gt;overall metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_122681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-122681" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-642x260.jpg" alt="Coffee in cup" class="wp-image-122681 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/CoffeeBowelCancer.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-122681" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The research adds to what we know about caffeine's effects. (Guido Mieth/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study involved a large sample, Mendelian randomization isn't infallible, and it's still possible that other factors are at play that weren't accounted for. More research will be needed to confirm cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess whether non-caloric caffeine containing beverages might play a role in reducing the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2023/march/caffeine-type2-diabetes.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; University of Bristol genetic epidemiologist Benjamin Woolf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9978685/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMJ Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in March 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Katherine Wells has been an epidemiologist working to protect the public from disease outbreaks for 25 years. Until January, she had never encountered measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I mean, we considered measles eradicated in the United States," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, as public health director for Lubbock, Texas, Wells is at the center of a measles outbreak that has infected &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;more than 700 people in Texas alone&lt;/a&gt;, sent more than 90 to the hospital and killed two otherwise healthy children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The outbreak is &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/" target="_blank"&gt;the largest since 2000&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections have surpassed the number of cases that occurred during a 2019 outbreak in New York, previously the largest one, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's frustrating," Wells said, "because we have the solution, which is a very effective vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells strongly believes her best chance to stop the viral infections is to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/14/1244690933/vaccine-expert-worries-child-measles-deaths-are-being-normalized" target="_blank"&gt;boost vaccination&lt;/a&gt; across West Texas, where immunization rates among kindergarteners have dropped in many counties, as they have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;nationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One of her toughest challenges: Anti-vaccine advocates have flooded the region with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5372760/measles-misinformation-poll" target="_blank"&gt;false claims&lt;/a&gt; about risks from vaccines. "They are moving ten times the speed we are," Wells told Tradeoffs when we caught up with her to talk about her experiences. Those false messages not only undermine the public's confidence in vaccines, she said, they sow distrust in public health more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Countering the misinformation takes money, Wells said, and the federal government — a reliable partner to local health officials in the past — has taken a step back. Wells' city and state abruptly lost federal public health funding in March when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cancelled more than $11 billion in grants nationwide. A spokesman for the state of Texas told Tradeoffs there aren't funds available to send to Lubbock, though the state has provided other types of support.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wells isn't giving up. "We can't let that noise disrupt what we need to do," she said. "We still need to focus on our community. We need to get vaccines in arms, even if that takes having one-on-one conversations with individuals."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Below are highlights from our conversation with Wells, edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the shock of facing a measles outbreak &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Public health always happens at 4:30 on a Friday afternoon. That afternoon my staff told me that we had two cases, two potential cases, of measles in the hospital. And that's not unusual. You always have doctors that see a rash and they want to test for measles. So I didn't think much of it. That next Monday, I'm actually on board for one of our community nonprofits, and I was sitting in that board meeting and the woman next to me said, 'My husband is a trainer of paramedics out in the rural areas and yesterday he told me that there was a lot of measles in Gaines County.' I literally got up out of my seat, walked out and started making some phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was scary. I'm going, well, am I overreacting or is this really something? But my gut feeling inside said there's something more going on. … If you underreact, then it's so contagious, it's just like exponential growth. So you want to get in as quickly as possible and figure out exactly how many cases there are. What's going on, on the ground? Are there other sick individuals? How can we make sure it stays in that one community and doesn't spread to other communities out in the region?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the ways  federal upheaval has complicated the measles fight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We're watching the CDC, HHS colleagues being laid off. All of this uncertainty. … I don't know what's going to be cut, what public health's going to look like at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But we have this team of people coming into work, seven days a week, helping families that are impacted with measles, combating the misinformation about vaccines, working with our providers who are needing to get children tested or adults tested, talking to businesses that might have had a measles exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That core public health work is continuing. And that's just an amazing workforce that's getting, you know, beat up in the national media, accused of their job not being important. But these people, because of their caring for the community, are continuing to show up every day, day in and day out, and making sure that the work that needs to happen during a measles outbreak happens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On facing the 'machine' that's churning out vaccine disinformation &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It is definitely a challenge. I almost call it a misinformation machine. … It's just hard to keep up with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5372760/measles-misinformation-poll" target="_blank"&gt;the messaging&lt;/a&gt;. You feel like you combat one bullet point on some kind of false information and then they pivot and find another. … You're watching the Children's Health Defense swoop in and start talking to the parents of the children who have died — giving false hope to a community and peddling cod liver oil and vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Being healthy — or taking these supplements — is not going to prevent your child from getting measles. And we don't know which child is going to have severe complications from measles. We don't know who's going to end up in the hospital and we don't know, unfortunately, which child may die.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On how to help people who are afraid of vaccines  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Trying to get somebody to take an injection when they're not sick, to prevent illness, just causes a lot of fear of the unknown. I've talked to a lot of parents that have said, "Well, we never had measles or polio or mumps in our community. So why, even if the risk for vaccines is so minuscule, why even take that risk if that disease doesn't exist?" We're seeing more physicians in our community willing to speak up on the importance of vaccine, more physicians willing to take the time with their patients to have those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;I think the one that really touched my heart was a mother with five young children, who had never vaccinated her children before. … She felt comfortable enough to come in and have that conversation with one of our nurses and got all five children vaccinated against measles with the MMR. … So we are getting through to individuals. It's just a slow process. She's just one of many parents that are now coming into the public health department — because we are that trusted messenger — to get the vaccine. … It's uplifting. You're so exhausted. I mean, we have worked three months straight without a day off, and it just gives you that boost of energy again— and some hope.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On cultivating community for the future of public health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It makes me want to double down on my work in public health. … Ten years from now, I hope that the narrative around vaccines is changed and we're back into a place where people can trust science and trust public health, and listen to those messages, and believe in community.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I still have some hope for all of this. There are 2,000 other health department directors out here, in the United States, who do this work day in and day out. And public health really happens on that local level – with individuals who know their community and want to make their community a better place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan Gorenstein is executive editor and Melanie Evans is a reporter for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://tradeoffs.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tradeoffs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a nonprofit news organization that reports on health care's toughest choices.

But just months later the previously healthy artist, now 38, was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'This is what early stages of ALS looks like. His legs were spasming and his reflexes so overactive he couldn’t correctly do this exercise. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'ALS was not on our radar yet and Eric hadn’t fully expressed just how worried he was about what was happening in his body.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJH31NRx4ac/"&gt;another video&lt;/a&gt;—watched 159,000 times—posted earlier this month but also taken around the beginning of 2020, Allie is filming Eric struggling to hold a pair of weights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He doesn't know it yet but that weakness in his hands is his first symptom of a terminal disease with no cure,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It has been five years since this video, feels like yesterday and also a lifetime ago. What I wouldn’t give to go back and not take a single thing for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am passionate about educating others on the nuances of this disease and giving people an understanding of what it looks like, to the best of my ability.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ALS &lt;span&gt;is a rare condition that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with twitches, cramps and muscle weakness are among the early signs of the condition, along with slurred speech and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-3c644480-2ccc-11f0-8eca-97e6d8dbea31"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In another video posted earlier this month but also taken around the beginning of 2020, Allie is filming Eric struggling to hold a pair of weights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;ALS can lead to paralysis and eventually death. The acclaimed scientist Stephen Hawking famously suffered from it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure but doctors can provide treatments to help reduce the impact it has on a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eric was only diagnosed with the condition after seeking medical attention for the weakness in his hands and loss of co-ordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;On his own Instagram account, Eric—an accomplished painter who now relies on a power wheelchair to get around—shares images of the artworks he creates using digital sculpting, eye tracking technology and 3D printing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In one post he said: 'Some days are harder than others. Something like a chest cold, so simple for those unaffected, can really bring you down, remind you your physical strength is leaving you little by little. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Something like coughing up that stubborn tickle in your throat, so simple in theory yet growing increasingly harder. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Seeing friends fighting this same fight not catching any breaks, just hit after hit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Sometimes it feels like it can break you, but that’s what strengthens my purpose to fight, for all of us facing ALS.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 5,000 adults in the UK have ALS and there is a one in 300 risk of developing the condition over the course of a person's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;ALS also claimed the life of Sandra Bullock's partner Bryan Randall (pictured with Sandra in 2018) in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leeds Rhinos star Rob Burrow (pictured) died last year at the age of just 41 after a four-and-a-half-year battle with MND &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Life expectancy for about half of those with the condition is between just two and five years from the onset of symptoms. But these can worsen rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people may live for up to 10 years, and, in rarer circumstances, even longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact cause is largely unknown, but current research points towards a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and possibly lifestyle factors—and it often hits seemingly fit and healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, Leeds Rhinos star Rob Burrow, 41, died after a four-and-a-half-year battle with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a rare neurological disorder that can also occur in some progressive cases of ALS. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 12:21:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>带状疱疹疫苗可将心脏病风险降低23 ％ ，对100万人的研究发现- CNN | Shingles vaccine reduces risk of heart disease by 23%, study of one million people finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPOUQ4QlpPMFhGcm9rdmw3a08tTWtDVjdMbFV5UU1wWG1Sb2kwVlMzbjJQR1VBYWt4S3Z1ZUxaNFNHbXkwX2lJSEJOMElyT0pLMGtvRTRFSlhITm1QUUdXS25qMXJsN2x4WGoxcVhrT0tTWDhrdmVSUDN2YVBlS0RhY255UmJzLVR5LWkw0gGQAUFVX3lxTE12RlN5enAzR19hUENlNHVDei1kYmRMZ1p6Ul85V1RhRzZPczJGSEdzWDM4d3BQSXZqYjh5OUdCSVQwVmJDTW9NY2xNN19kd1lXcVZiVk1yMGlTSE9GZld4ZkVOODd4b21LZ19JX2dyV1VSMVA3SE1oaktlUWRMd1FQRFlvZk9VVWp2d192SFJObA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Getting the shingles vaccine could do more than just prevent a painful red rash — it may also lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, according to a new South Korean study of more than one million people published in the &lt;a href="https://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/shingles-vaccine-lowers-the-risk-of-heart-disease-for-up-to-eight-years" target="_blank"&gt;European Heart Journal.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00023j6n1tncd0rs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=About%201%20in%203%20people,have%20shingles%20more%20than%20once." target="_blank"&gt;highly common&lt;/a&gt; herpes strain, also called varicella-zoster virus (VZV), can cause chickenpox in childhood and later develop into shingles in older or immuno-compromised adults. The shingles vaccine is already considered a top-line defense against the virus, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/health/shingles-vaccine-dementia-prevention-wellness"&gt;recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have pointed to other unexpected health benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00033j6nwhe2j6s8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An analysis of health outcomes for 1,271,922 people age 50 and older found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular disease among those who were vaccinated for shingles. The reduced risk was most noticeable up to eight years after vaccination among males, people under 60, and even those with “unhealthy lifestyles,” such as chronic smoking or drinking, according to the May 6 study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00043j6num94p1sl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Since shingles can cause inflammation in blood vessels and lead to blood clots, which in turn raise the risk of heart disease, preventing shingles through vaccination might also help reduce these cardiovascular risks,” explained Hayeon Lee, a coauthor and researcher from the Lee Kyung Hee University College of Medicine in an email. It’s also possible that the nerve damage caused by shingles could disturb the heart’s rhythm, leading to irregular palpitations and even cardiac arrest, per the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00053j6ne1o0v4er@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The vaccine may be better at preventing shingles in younger patients and males because of their more robust immune systems, Lee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00063j6nkbc2werc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If a vaccine helps lower the risk of both infection and serious chronic conditions, it becomes an even more valuable public health tool,” Lee said. “This study supports a broader understanding of vaccination — not just as a shield against infectious diseases, but as part of a more comprehensive approach to maintaining long-term health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00073j6n6v862hzn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed to determine a direct causal link between vaccination and reduced cardiovascular event risk, but this analysis is the largest and most comprehensive so far, presenting a compelling case for those on the fence about vaccination, said Dr. Sharon Curhan, a physician and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00083j6nws7v0690@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since this herpes strain can lie dormant in the body for years after exposure before it reactivates into shingles, you don’t need a history of chickenpox to get the vaccine, Curhan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir00093j6n5svhtw3p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, more than 99% of adults age 50 years and older worldwide have been exposed to VZV, and many may not have had, or known they had chickenpox at all, according to estimates from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000b3j6n62pr2p9a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients from the study used an older variation of the shingles vaccine that is being phased out of most countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000c3j6nspj3km9b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The live zoster vaccine, no longer available in the US &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/hcp/vaccine-considerations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;as of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, contains a living but weakened form of the virus used to generate an immune response. It’s since been swapped for Shingrix, a two-shot recombinant zoster vaccine containing only part of the virus — which has shown to be more effective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000d3j6nklet201u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More research is needed to compare the various health benefits of these different vaccine variations, said Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000e3j6n0busxm50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The biggest limitation of this type of research is that you’re essentially comparing people who get vaccinated to those who don’t get vaccinated,” Geldsetzer said. “We know that those people who decide to get vaccinated are often very different from those who don’t in their health motivations and behaviors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000f3j6n7y3j4zx5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers were able to sort for several demographic variables such as age, sex, income level and pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol. They also considered the frequency of medical visits and use of specific medications based on national insurance records, Lee said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000g3j6nop1mg1ig@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some variables, like diet, other vaccinations, and proper adherence to treatments, can always slip through the cracks in non-clinical trials which use large data sets like the one used in this study, Geldsetzer said. For this reason, he hopes future studies can be randomized and use data from a clinical setting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000h3j6nptuep5ys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, Lee said future research should observe more racially and ethnically diverse populations, as immune responses can vary across different populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000j3j6nlcctus08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These findings follow several other studies identifying the possible health benefits of shingles vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000k3j6nzqiuk6bk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In April, Geldsetzer and a team of researchers from Stanford published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08800-x" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that found people who received the vaccine had a 20% reduced risk of dementia compared with those who didn’t get it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000l3j6nkmesiz7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This study took advantage of a “natural experiment” after Wales rolled out its shingles vaccination program in 2013. Due to limited vaccine supply, government officials decided that only Welsh adults born on or after a very specific date would be eligible, so researchers could directly compare the health outcomes of two groups of individuals over time while limiting covariables.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmafvq9ir000m3j6nnk6d2kfh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is likely because shingles doesn’t just cause inflammation in the blood vessels, said Geldsetzer. It also inflames nerves throughout the body, which can lead to long-lasting pain disorders and, in the case of dementia, brain tissue damage.

Up to 30 per cent of men in the UK are said to be affected by the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies suggest it normally takes men about five-and-a-half minutes to orgasm during sex. But for about one in three, this occurs within three minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say that both psychological and physical factors can lead to the problem, including stress, depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One 2014 study detailed the benefits of kegels for men dealing with lifelong premature ejaculation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However it is said that a regimen of tensing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles, known as kegel exercises, has been shown to help extend the length of intimacy by two minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One 2014 study asked male participants to perform kegel exercises for an hour three times a week for 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal Therapeutic Advances in Urology, Italian doctors from the Sapienza Univeristy of Rome included 40 men who had dealt with premature ejaculation for much of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the study, 83 per cent of the patients had gained control of their ejaculatory reflex and were able to ‘last’ about two minutes and forty seconds longer than the average duration at the start of the study—about 39 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

could prevent around half of &lt;a href="/topic/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cases from reaching an advanced stage, new research suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are currently trying to determine the effectiveness of simple blood tests in detecting cancer before symptoms appear, and whether such early detection improves survival rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; is currently trialling such tests, including the Galleri test and miONCO-Dx test, with experts predicting a nationwide rollout of a universal cancer screening program within the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers writing in the journal BMJ Open say screening people annually – or every two years – could significantly boost early detection and prevent cancers from progressing to stages where treatment is less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experts turned to mathematical modelling to see how a multi-cancer blood test would change what happened to a group of 50 to 79-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used both fast-growing tumours (which remain at stage I for two to four years before progressing);

(PA Wire)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Peter Sasieni, professor of cancer epidemiology at &lt;a href="/topic/queen-mary-university-of-london"&gt;Queen Mary University of London&lt;/a&gt;, who has a lead role on the Galleri trial, told the PA news agency: “I am very excited about the science behind these tests, but we need to ensure that the technological game-changer translates to clinical benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is why we are conducting a huge randomised controlled trial to see whether the prediction made by this modelling is reasonably accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The advances in molecular biology and artificial intelligence means that we are now able to find tiny fragments of many cancers in a small blood sample. That is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to show that using these tests in people without symptoms can help identify cancers earlier when they can be successfully treated, thereby preventing advanced cancer and reducing the numbers dying from cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof Sasieni said he hopes that “by 2032, there should be sufficient evidence to say categorically how many lives can be saved by annual screening”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “That could lead to national rollout being completed within the next 10 years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He suggested the NHS should be able to negotiate “a much better price per test” with manufacturers for annual screening rather than every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NHS might expect an additional 15 million blood tests per year with the technology, which is around a 2.5 per cent increase on current figures, but should not be a problem, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 lfIPRg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=85%2C134%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/02/20/9/51/iStock-113121982.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;crop=3%3A2%2Csmart&amp;amp;trim=85%2C134%2C0%2C0&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Cancer types studied included bladder, breast, cervical, bowel, kidney, liver and bile-duct, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, skin and blood cancers such as leukaemia" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-101588"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Cancer types studied included bladder, breast, cervical, bowel, kidney, liver and bile-duct, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, skin and blood cancers such as leukaemia&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr David Crosby, head of prevention and early detection research at &lt;a href="/topic/cancer-research-uk"&gt;Cancer Research UK&lt;/a&gt;, said: “Multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests are a promising area of cancer research that could help clinicians diagnose cancers earlier, potentially helping more people survive cancer and live longer, better lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is encouraging that the modelling from this research predicts that annual screening with an MCED test could reduce deaths from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, as with any new clinical innovation, large-scale clinical trials and independent reviews are needed to fully assess the benefits and risks of using MCED tests in the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With many researchers and companies active in the cancer early detection space and a range of tests available, we want to see Government and NHS support for a wide range of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That way, we can maximise the chances of finding tests that improve cancer outcomes and make a meaningful difference to patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, the &lt;a href="/topic/department-of-health"&gt;Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; announced the NHS trial of the miONCO-Dx blood test with 8,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It works by examining the microRNA in a blood sample and uses AI to identify if cancer is present and, if so, where it is located in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial tests show the test can detect up to 12 common cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 10:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxPU25Va21EcndLbWphZzlTSDFYdF8zcjNtd2U5REd2UUlYRHBHT01YRHFVd3I0blRoRjU3ZXFHV1BuNVhXVFBQLUdZRXJXcVFJUEt4ZE5kRUV6UXIwTmlBam93SmM1Ynd3eW9RakF1RDc0R29tajBPTmxuOUZBZjJSVVhPWFhZcjRwd2lBOWdwMGN3ZUlMZDh1M3lyMmZLLW9VV29IMU1KTDNFUFJ4eUdUSXhGME13eDdjQndscWNn</guid></item><item><title>前HaysMed肿瘤学家在堪萨斯州西部开设新诊所- Hays Post | Former HaysMed oncologist opens new practice in western Kansas - Hays Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE9PSVU4WUJUbEJZay1ZR1NLSlJYa2I1aDhzc1JReHNkdG42a29Nd0FlNW1FOEg5a3NKQlZud2l2MHJVWUVQbmQ0RlpWQS0yUzRCQnZCV2MxQTZmQW02V2xZdHFvVnpjR1RlejN2MnVuOTk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="p-4 text-lg text-gray-800 leading-loose"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;By CRISTINA JANNEY&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hays Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former HaysMed oncologist has opened a new practice in western Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Robert Rodriguez, medical oncologist, and Amanda Volchko, advanced practice provider, started seeing patients two weeks ago through their practice, Western Kansas Oncology Group, serving Oakley, Tribune and Goodland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/5/1746731676329.jpeg" alt="Dr. Robert Rodriguez"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;Dr. Robert Rodriguez&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice is based in Tribune but works with all three critical-access hospitals in those three communities. The practice offers in-person visits as well as telemedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice is accepting new oncology and hematology patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez treats cancer patients and blood cancer patients, but under hematology, also treats patients with noncancerous anemia or low platelets, which can happen as a result of interactions with medications or aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez received both his undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Kansas. He did his residency and fellowship at the University of Kansas Medical Center. He spent an additional two years at the medical center before moving to western Kansas to work for HaysMed, where he worked for just less than 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/a05ca048-415e-412f-bcea-55ff325a76b9"&gt;Rodriguez was one of two former HaysMed doctors who sued the hospital, arguing the noncompete clauses in their contracts, which would have kept them from practicing within a 110-mile radius of Hays, were too restrictive.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hayspost.com/posts/057d44cb-ad96-4aab-951d-a71a18cbee0a"&gt; The doctors and hospital came to a resolution through meditation, but the terms of that agreement were kept confidential.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="py-8"&gt;&lt;img class="mx-auto w-full sm:w-full md:w-full" src="https://media.eaglewebservices.com/public/2025/5/1746731753831.jpeg" alt="Amanda Volchko, PA"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="text-center italic text-gray-700 text-sm pt-2"&gt;Amanda Volchko, PA&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volchko was born and raised in New Jersey. She trained in Philadelphia before a recruiter hired her to work in Hoxie. Rodriguez met Volchko while working in Hays, and she expressed an interest in working with cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My No. 1 directive at this point is to bring treatment locally," Rodriguez said. "In my time at my previous employment, everyone had to come to our location, come to Hays, come to the University of Kansas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to keep people as close to home as possible. Our primary directive is to get as much of that care done locally as possible, including cancer evaluation, chemotherapy administration, and diagnostic imaging and labs. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez said getting treatment close to home makes a "huge" difference for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you can imagine any time someone has to get systemic treatment for a malignancy, it's not the best day of their life," he said. "Even when you do it 100% correctly, it still takes a toll on the person."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing care closer to patients means they don't have to drive hours for care. That is physically better for the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It helps emotionally," Rodriguez said, "and it really does help financially. Sometimes funds are limited. These treatments are expensive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients rarely come for treatment alone. Rodriguez said local treatment results in less stress for the family members and friends who are assisting the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we come to them is greatly beneficial and so appreciated by everyone I have worked with in these first few weeks," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there are no cures for the diseases that Rodriguez treats, an oncologist aims to extend life and enhance quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the end, we're trying to buy people more time to live their life, to be with friends, family, and experience things they love," Rodriguez said. "The less time you spend with me, the better. The less time you have to spend traveling, even better than that. We're trying to have our cake and eat it too, where they still get the excellent care they would receive somewhere like the University of Kansas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also wanted patients to know he will be their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether Amanda [Volchko] sees you or not, I am the one making those final plans. I will be making those plans even if I'm on vacation or if it's in the middle of the night, I will be your person," Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he will also work with other physicians as needed, adding that through his experience, he's made many connections with other doctors across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez, who is a Goodland native, said he and his wife, who is a Larned native, wanted to stay in western Kansas and give back to rural communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My desire had always been to go back and help the people that helped me," he said. "I didn't get to this place alone. I had excellent teachers and a community that shaped me into the person I am today. I have a sincere desire to help them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice's appointments are filling fast. The Oakley clinic is full through July. Rodriguez said he wanted to thank the community for supporting the practice thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really excited to get this project going," Rodriguez said. "It's been a dream of mine since graduating from medical school. It's finally happening, and the support that I have received from the community has been nothing but spectacular. I look forward to the rest of my career doing this very thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To contact the practice, call 620-720-2744.

This applies to adults, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, the elderly, and children aged 11 to 17. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Ahmed, most people only need around 10 micrograms, which is equivalent to 400 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vitamin D helps regulate the amount of calcium and phosphate in the body - keeping bones, teeth and muscles healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Whilst Dr Ahmed agreed that the optimum range is likely higher than the ones usually stated, he said taking too much vitamin D can be really dangerous, especially if you don't get your blood checked regularly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Dr Ahmed agreed with NHS guidelines that recommend a supplement dose of no more than 100 micrograms units a day, he said some people do need a much higher dose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are patients who have very low vitamin D on their blood tests', he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the minimum threshold of vitamin D, set out by the institute of medicine, is 20ng/ml. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the UK's threshold for deficiency is much lower, at 12ng/ml, a level that has long been criticised by international health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The amount you need as a supplement depends on your symptoms, your ethnicity, your skin colour, but also your blood test result', Dr Ahmed cautioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is why the doctor, who has over 95,500 followers on Instagram, urged anyone who takes vitamin D supplements to get a blood test to see if they are taking too much of the so-called sunshine vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I urge most people taking vitamin D supplements to get their levels checked regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You have to take it carefully and responsibly and not take too much of a high dose.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ahmed is not the first medic to warn against megadoses of vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NHS surgeon Doctor Karan Rajan previously suggested looking for vitamin D supplements that contain vitamin K2, which helps reduce the risk of calcium being deposited in the blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While supplements can help to boost vitamin D levels, experts say adequate sunlight exposure and a healthy diet that includes things like oily fish, red meat and fortified foods, are the best sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 09:36:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>墨西哥的疫苗团队争先恐后地应对门诺派社区爆发的麻疹疫情-美联社新闻 | Vaccine teams in Mexico scramble over measles outbreak rippling out from Mennonite community - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxPdG5JR1J2LURnRW1KYVgwdkloTWdnRHp5Q3pXUmFtaTFobnZOdGJGZmhOSExWWnVoT2lxVjREbHZrRGsxNVZucndwQ0J5MWVQaDZ6Mmxya083bmdsTVpha0RVZmlXNldXdHR0S3VnX3FzSjZSanhVckJtRW9TUUlCMVFIZndfVnphLVRnT2dLd0JCdzZBdkxJek9feWN1TUgxQy15ZGRzVzExVEp2YktvR1IzRTE3LTlnRWMtWUcyelJYd1F6LWFJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 May 2025 07:09:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxPdG5JR1J2LURnRW1KYVgwdkloTWdnRHp5Q3pXUmFtaTFobnZOdGJGZmhOSExWWnVoT2lxVjREbHZrRGsxNVZucndwQ0J5MWVQaDZ6Mmxya083bmdsTVpha0RVZmlXNldXdHR0S3VnX3FzSjZSanhVckJtRW9TUUlCMVFIZndfVnphLVRnT2dLd0JCdzZBdkxJek9feWN1TUgxQy15ZGRzVzExVEp2YktvR1IzRTE3LTlnRWMtWUcyelJYd1F6LWFJ</guid></item><item><title>感受、事实和我们的真相危机--调度 | Feelings, Facts, and Our Crisis of Truth - The Dispatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE4xd2NfS1M3Ty03RXNHNkpvVmEweFpPQmM2RUw5SVFObXpIbElsUVphQjZ5RWhVbG9nQW1tbU4zR09SbVV1LWQyYUhYWHFtaEdaMzJNU1czcUp2NlhTajRrRFZGU3dHNEFyT0JpcFQ0RGlMai14aDR4RWFhVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tight-template drop-cap"&gt;
                &lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An outbreak of measles—a disease once declared eliminated in the U.S.—has hospitalized &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;91 people&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, killing two unvaccinated school-aged children. It is a horrific disease: In severe cases, a child’s immune system collapses, and they suffer seizures and brain damage from encephalitis or drown as fluid fills their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And any outbreak of measles is entirely preventable. The first vaccine was introduced 62 years ago, and vaccination saved an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles"&gt;60 million lives&lt;/a&gt; between 2000 and 2023 alone. Measles epidemics once represented a public health crisis, but today the disease represents a different kind of affliction—one that is both psychological and cultural in nature, and one that is surprisingly resistant to intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a recent episode of the &lt;em&gt;Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, British author Douglas Murray challenged the world’s most popular podcaster over his penchant for hosting “armchair experts” who promote ideas outside of the mainstream. Specifically, Murray cited Rogan’s interviews with Daryl Cooper, a podcaster who has argued that Winston Churchill was the “real villain” of World War II, and comedian Dave Smith, who appeared on the podcast with Murray, and whose taste for criticizing Israel has never inspired him to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DISEKHxtgl1/"&gt;pay a visit&lt;/a&gt;. Murray faced significant backlash from right-wing influencers on social media, while writers at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;UnHerd&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Quillette&lt;/em&gt; rallied behind him. Yet despite the lengthy conversation, which spanned hours, some crucial concepts were left unaddressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;        


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main issue that Murray did not raise was that in the ecosystem that Rogan occupies, many podcasters and their listeners &lt;em&gt;do not read&lt;/em&gt;. Murray brought his norms of journalistic rigor into a largely postliterate culture, where information is consumed via aural and visual formats as opposed to the written word. It was a clash of cultures between an author and journalist who primarily lives in the world of printed text, and those who primarily live in the world of conversation and storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This postliterate shift isn’t merely occurring in digital media ecosystems—it has penetrated some of the world’s most prestigious educational institutions. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/"&gt;In an article for &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year, Rose Horowitch described students at elite universities who struggle to read an entire book. One first-year student confessed she had never been assigned a complete book throughout high school—only excerpts and articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to distinguish the difference between a literate and postliterate world. For centuries, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/0198229976?ref_=mr_referred_us_au_au"&gt;women died in childbirth&lt;/a&gt; at relatively steady rates. Only when doctors started sharing knowledge about obstetric techniques in medical journals did mortality rates start to decline. Sharing knowledge via the written word enhances the accuracy of the transmitted information, whereas oral reinterpretations lend themselves to inefficiency and error. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When an audio-visual narrative culture—which lacks the precision and permanence of written documentation—combines with amateur methods, our collective ability to discern the truth simply deteriorates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem with armchair experts like Daryl Cooper and Dave Smith isn’t what they claim but how they reach those claims. Their conclusions may occasionally align with reality, but they arrive there without the rigor that ensures reliability. When someone forms theories about Churchill or Israel without consulting primary sources or visiting the region, they’re charting territory blindly. Criticism, therefore, should focus on process instead of results: Their flawed methods inevitably produce unreliable findings, even when they occasionally stumble onto correct conclusions by chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to working out what is true in the world, there is a hierarchy of method. If I fear I have cancer in my body, I am perfectly free to visit a psychic if I choose to—but her technique for discovering a malignant growth is going to be less effective than an oncologist’s. This doesn’t mean that the oncologist is always right, or that the psychic is always wrong. What it means is that the tools used by the oncologist—blood tests and radiology—are simply better than sensing, reading tea leaves, or consulting the stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other empirical professions have a hierarchy of methods, too. History scholars examine secondary sources (written accounts of the time period), but also primary sources (manuscripts and contemporaneous eyewitness accounts) of the era they wish to understand. Just as someone who is unable to replace the carburetor of his car cannot call himself a mechanic, anyone who does not consult primary sources in their research cannot call themselves a historian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;blockquote class="content-large pull-quote default-py small-my pl-0 border-l-0 border-y border-black/30 border-dashed custom-block"&gt;

                    “Rigor dampens engagement, and uncertainty saps attention. The marketplace of ideas has been subsumed by a marketplace of emotions, where incentives reward those with the sloppiest procedures.”            &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalism also has a method. While not all journalism is alike (this opinion column is not the same as an investigative piece), one expects journalists reporting on a conflict or protest or natural disaster to do so from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;These empirical professions each employ graduated standards of evidence. Gut intuition, vibes, tea leaves, psychic readings, tarot cards, revelations, and superstition fall below the threshold of acceptable evidence. Just above this threshold sit anecdotes and case studies: “My auntie said she saw a UFO last night.” One level higher are cohort studies, synthesis of secondary sources, and analysis of contemporaneous reports. At the top sit randomized controlled trials, original research using primary sources, and on-the-ground investigative reporting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the mid-20th century, many elite institutions have rejected the philosophical orientation of empiricism in favor of a faddish postmodern view of the world. Postmodernism, alongside romanticist and fundamentalist religious modes of thought, rejects the notion that humans are able to discern what is true through data collection and experimentation. Romanticists believe that the &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/newsletter/gfile/donald-trump-rousseau-nietzsche-nationalism/"&gt;truth is discerned through feeling&lt;/a&gt;, fundamentalists through revelation—and postmodernists believe that there is no such thing as truth at all. Our new media ecosystem blends all three of these outlooks, rendering empiricism a quaint relic of another age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tucker Carlson speaks of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/tucker-carlson-demon-attack"&gt;being attacked by demons&lt;/a&gt; in his sleep, Candace Owens dismisses the &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobotPolisher/status/1913002527815069909"&gt;moon landing&lt;/a&gt; as “fake and gay,” and Russell Brand sells amulets to his followers to ward off “evil energies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During and after the pandemic, Bret Weinstein—an evolutionary biologist who was once hounded out of Evergreen State College, and who is now a professional podcaster—claimed mRNA vaccines were “&lt;a href="https://medium.com/rebel-wisdom/on-vaccine-safety-ivermectin-and-the-dark-horse-podcast-an-investigation-f32491d4c970"&gt;unsafe for women&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240108035213/https://tuckercarlson.com/the-tucker-carlson-encounter-bret-weinstein/"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; to Tucker Carlson that “17 million people” had died from COVID vaccines, and pronounced this imaginary death toll “a great tragedy of history.” But every step Weinstein took away from rigor increased his audience and influence. Peer-reviewed research is slow and time-consuming. Sharing lurid stories of vaccine injuries is easy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Bret Weinstein’s conspiracy theories &lt;a href="https://jessesingal.substack.com/p/bret-weinstein-sure-has-a-lot-of"&gt;span multiple domains&lt;/a&gt;. Documented by Chris Kavanagh, of the &lt;a href="https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoding the Gurus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast, and &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/author/jesse-singal/"&gt;Jesse Singal&lt;/a&gt;, independent journalist and &lt;em&gt;Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; contributor, Weinstein has suggested that Israel’s unpreparedness for the October 7 attack was deliberately orchestrated by powerful interests to create division among COVID skeptics; China’s one-child policy was strategically designed to create an army of males to infiltrate the U.S. military; and that his own groundbreaking telomere research was stolen by one of his peers—who went on to win a Nobel Prize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The continuous positive feedback from a growing audience doesn’t just reward methodological shortcuts—it demands them. There is no clearer demonstration of how audience capture drives counter-Enlightenment thinking in digital media than Weinstein’s trajectory. Rigor dampens engagement, and uncertainty saps attention. The marketplace of ideas has been subsumed by a marketplace of emotions, where incentives reward those with the sloppiest procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-dots"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 2022 book,&lt;em&gt; Liberalism and Its Discontents&lt;/em&gt;, Francis Fukuyama writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack on modern natural science and Enlightenment approaches to cognition began on the left, as critical theory exposed the hidden agendas of the elites who promoted them. This approach denied the possibility of true objectivity, and valued instead subjective feelings and emotions as a source of authenticity. Skepticism has now drifted over to the populist right, who see elites using these same scientific cognitive modes not as techniques to marginalize minority communities, but rather to victimize the former mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Fukuyama described is an ideological inversion: The left’s tools of deconstruction are now used by the right. Pandora’s box has been opened, and epistemic nihilism cannot be selectively applied. In 2017, a Canadian political scientist, Matt McManus, &lt;a href="https://quillette.com/2018/05/17/emergence-rise-postmodern-conservatism/"&gt;wrote for &lt;em&gt;Quillette&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; “postmodern conservatives are not substantially different from their leftwing opponents. Both regard identity as the locus of epistemic and moral validity, and both are preoccupied with achieving power since that is their only major concern.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to take our modern world for granted—running water, piped-in gas, an electricity grid, internet, superabundant consumer goods, medicines, and life-saving surgeries performed under anesthesia. Citizens in a modern liberal society are like fish in water: They don’t comprehend the luxuriousness of their lifestyles and could not survive without them. We are surrounded by the fruits of liberal capitalism to the point where critics of this system rely on the very tools created by it to condemn it. Yet success has bred complacency, and in the third decade of the 21st century, this complacency is now coming home to roost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                    “Sharing knowledge via the written word enhances the accuracy of the transmitted information, whereas oral reinterpretations lend themselves to inefficiency and error.”             &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;div class="rich-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, a country founded on Enlightenment ideals, is at a crossroads: Trade policy is conducted according to vibes, anti-vaccine propaganda is spread by the highest health official of the land, and children now die of a once-eliminated disease.A path forward requires a counter-counter-Enlightenment. This doesn’t require censorship or an appeal to authority, but a return to rigor and the written word. While podcasts and videos are undoubtedly entertaining, their ability to transmit knowledge is time-consuming and inefficient. They are the equivalent of the fireside yarn—what humans did before we emerged from our caves. Text may not be as popular as a three-hour podcast conversation, but it remains the form of knowledge most likely to be accessed by future generations. &lt;em&gt;Principia Mathematica&lt;/em&gt; was not a podcast, and &lt;em&gt;On the Origins of Species&lt;/em&gt; was not a video series. Technologies may continue to create disruption, but we won’t enter a new Dark Age unless we forget the ability to read and write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Psychedelics like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lsd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73096" data-postid="160828" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6007659/"&gt;and psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are gaining &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/mind-molding-psychedelic-drugs-could-treat-depression-and-other-mental-illnesses-98071"&gt;increasing attention in psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/27/12/pyae057/7912598"&gt;Studies suggest&lt;/a&gt; they may offer therapeutic benefits for conditions such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="160828" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder, eating disorders and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2025/jan/psychedelic-drug-being-tested-treatment-heavy-drinking"&gt;Our research team&lt;/a&gt; is investigating whether &lt;a href="https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/dmt/"&gt;N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)&lt;/a&gt;, a fast-acting psychedelic, can help people reduce alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is the most commonly &lt;a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7626/CBP-7626.pdf"&gt;misused substance in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, partly because it is legal, widely available and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4872611/"&gt;deeply ingrained in social culture&lt;/a&gt;. While many people can enjoy alcohol &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3536464/"&gt;in moderation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/127/public-accounts-committee/news/195391/government-not-taking-appalling-harms-from-alcohol-seriously-enough/"&gt;a significant number&lt;/a&gt; struggle to control their drinking. For these people, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-misuse/"&gt;excessive alcohol consumption&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious physical, mental and social consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional treatments don't work for everyone, which is why we're exploring alternatives, such as psychedelics, that might enable people to change their behaviour in a single, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/psychedelic-drugs-can-be-almost-as-life-altering-as-near-death-experiences-189325"&gt;transformative experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DMT is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10122081/"&gt;metabolised rapidly&lt;/a&gt; in the body. When &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10206108/"&gt;administered intravenously&lt;/a&gt;, the effects kick in almost immediately, typically within one to two minutes. However, these effects are short-lived, lasting only ten to 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its brief duration, many users describe the experience as intensely profound. They often report vivid visions, complex patterns and a sensation of entering a different reality. In some cases, the experience leads to a complete shift in how they think, feel and perceive the world. For many, the experience is deeply meaningful and transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens in the brain during this time, and how might it influence long-term behaviour, such as reducing alcohol consumption?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Neuroplasticity and addiction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychedelicunit.com/"&gt;Our team&lt;/a&gt; is particularly interested in how psychedelics like DMT might help in the context of addiction. One theory is that psychedelics can &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/42/45/8439"&gt;temporarily enhance neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, the brain's ability to form new neural connections. This temporary boost could open a window of flexibility, allowing some people to be more open to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone stuck in the cycle of heavy drinking, this enhanced plasticity might help them break old habits and develop healthier behaviour. Essentially, it could offer the brain &lt;a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PB-0064/POST-PB-0064.pdf"&gt;an opportunity to "rewire"&lt;/a&gt; itself and disrupt the unhealthy patterns that underlie addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yS9FBB19Ws0?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're also focusing on the brain's reward and motivation systems, which &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK424849/#:%7E:text=The%20%E2%80%9Creward%20circuitry%E2%80%9D%20of%20the,%2C%20substance%20seeking%2C%20and%20use."&gt;play a key role&lt;/a&gt; in addiction. These systems influence behaviour associated with pleasure, including eating, sex and drinking alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In people with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4633413/"&gt;alcohol use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, these systems become hypersensitive to alcohol-related cues, often at the expense of other rewarding experiences. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11978192/"&gt;Some early research&lt;/a&gt; suggests psychedelics may help "reset" these reward pathways. We're testing this theory to see whether DMT can reduce alcohol consumption by recalibrating the brain's reward system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore these possibilities, we've designed a study with heavy drinkers who are motivated to reduce their alcohol intake. Every participant undergoes a thorough screening to ensure they're fit for the study and all sessions are conducted in a highly controlled, clinical setting with medical professionals and experienced researchers overseeing the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involves three visits to our lab at UCL. On the first and third visits, we use &lt;a href="https://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info/fmribrain"&gt;functional magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) to measure brain activity and observe how different regions of the brain interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the scans, participants watch emotionally engaging films, which offer a more natural way to study brain responses compared to abstract tasks. This helps us assess how DMT might impact brain function in real-life, emotionally charged situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second visit, participants are randomly assigned to receive either DMT, a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="160828" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;, or a non-psychedelic drug (&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ijnp/article/19/4/pyv102/2910039"&gt;D-cycloserine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/lisuride"&gt;Lisuride&lt;/a&gt;). These non-psychedelic substances are believed to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763425001320"&gt;promote neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt; without inducing the full psychedelic effects of DMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546641/"&gt;study is double-blind&lt;/a&gt; – neither the participants nor the researchers know which substance is being administered. This helps eliminate bias and ensures that the results are as reliable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we measure changes in brain activity during the drug infusion using &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/electroencephalogram/"&gt;electroencephalography (EEG)&lt;/a&gt;. EEG tracks the brain's electrical signals and could help us predict which participants are most likely to benefit from DMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants also complete a range of psychological assessments, including questionnaires and tasks that measure memory, attention, mood and decision-making. This data will help us understand how changes in brain function might relate to changes in drinking behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What we're hoping to discover&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're still in the process of collecting data, but we're excited to see whether DMT can lead to meaningful reductions in alcohol consumption. As researchers, it's crucial that we stay objective and allow the evidence to guide our conclusions. By keeping the study "blinded" until all results are in, we ensure that our findings are unbiased and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If DMT proves effective in helping people reduce their alcohol consumption, particularly for those who have struggled with other treatments, it could pave the way for a new approach to addiction therapy. Even if the results are inconclusive, they will still provide valuable insights into the potential role of psychedelics in addiction treatment and open up new avenues for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKR-jvGlkNg?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to emphasise that this research is taking place in a safe, controlled environment. Psychedelics are potent substances, and their effects can be unpredictable, especially outside of clinical settings. They are not a "magic bullet" and are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/psychedelics-could-make-mental-health-worse-in-people-with-a-personality-disorder-226099"&gt;not suitable for everyone&lt;/a&gt;. The controlled setting allows us to study their effects while minimising risk to participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, we believe psychedelics &lt;a href="https://www.psychedelicunit.com/unity-alcohol"&gt;offer a unique opportunity&lt;/a&gt; to better understand the brain and its capacity for change. By examining how transformative experiences can influence behaviour, we hope to contribute to the development of more effective treatments for addiction and other mental health conditions.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/255454/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Takeaways &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are a lot of misconceptions about weight loss—especially online.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians agree that myths like carbs make you gain weight and you need to track calories and macros can cause more harm than good. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instead, tips like prioritizng a balanced diet and exercise you enjoy can help support healthy, sustainable weight loss in the long term. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="theme-blockquote__author_1-0" class="comp theme-blockquote__author mntl-text-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In an endless stream of health and wellness content, it can be easy to fall for the promise of quick fixes. From restrictive diets that guarantee rapid weight loss to “fat-burning” supplements backed by influencers, these trends gain viral popularity despite little scientific evidence to back them. Far from harmless, some of these misconceptions may negatively impact your health. We spoke with registered dietitians to debunk the most common myths about weight loss and what you should know instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-1-carbs-make-you-gain-weight"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #1: Carbs Make You Gain Weight &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many diets encourage eliminating carbohydrates, claiming that skipping carbs will help you lose weight fast. But registered dietitians know better. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Carbohydrates are your body’s main source of fuel, particularly your brain. Plus, complex carbs are full of important nutrients like fiber, something many of us already don’t get enough of,” says &lt;a href="https://www.therethinkteam.com/devyn-goodman" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Devyn Goodman, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming 45 to 65% of daily energy intake from carbohydrates, which gives you enough energy to live your best life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cutting out carbs might lead to short-term changes, but it often triggers cravings, low energy and feeling out of control around food,” explains &lt;a href="https://revvhealth.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Marissa Beck, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that low-carb diets may reduce body fat in the short term, for up to 6 months, but their benefits diminish over time.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Eliminating carbs may also cause nutritional imbalances–if you’re not eating carbs, you’ll have to replace them with more fat and protein. Eating too much fat and protein from high-fat animal products may increase your risk of developing high cholesterol and insulin resistance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of eliminating carbs, eat balanced meals and snacks that include protein, carbs and fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-2-the-faster-you-lose-weight-the-better"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #2: The Faster You Lose Weight, the Better &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We live in a world of instant gratification, so it makes sense that you may want immediate weight loss results and will often go to great lengths to get them. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Rapid weight loss often means losing water and muscle mass, not just fat. It can also slow your metabolism, making it harder to maintain that new weight long-term,” Beck explains. “Many people regain the weight they lost—and sometimes more—because their body is trying to recover from what it perceives as a threat.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The National Institutes of Health (NIH) emphasizes gradual, sustainable behavior changes for effective weight loss, long-term health and prevention of weight cycling, which has been associated with increased risks of heart disease, insulin resistance and other metabolic issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To counter these risks, Beck says she focuses on sustainable habits that help people feel better about their bodies, regardless of what the scale says. While sustainable eating behavior changes might not make the weight come off quickly, “you will retain muscle and support a healthier metabolism, better energy levels and long-term weight stability (if your body is meant to change at all),” Beck tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-3-you-need-to-track-every-calorie-and-macro"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #3: You Need to Track Every Calorie And Macro &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may think you need to log your food and track your calories or macros (short for the macronutrients: carbohydrates, protein and fat) to lose weight, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. “While food tracking can bring short-term awareness to what you’re eating, it often disconnects people from their natural hunger and fullness cues,” says Beck. “We aren’t meant to eat by numbers forever. Obsessively counting calories or macros can increase anxiety around food and lead to burnout. Success comes from building flexible habits and learning to trust your body again, not from micromanaging what you eat,” she adds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calorie tracking often accompanies cookie-cutter calorie targets that are too low, which can also interfere with your health and weight loss goals. “Your body burns energy differently depending on your metabolism, the food you eat and the amount of physical activity you do. You could eat the same calories as someone else and have completely different outcomes,” says Goodman. A 2020 study found that intuitive eating, which focuses on internal hunger and fullness cues, reduces food-related anxiety and disordered eating compared to rigid tracking, promoting a healthier relationship with food.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of tracking, Goodman recommends being mindful of portion sizes and aiming for balance and variety. “This is more attainable and sustainable for most people,” she explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-4-you-have-to-cut-out-entire-food-groups-to-lose-weight"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #4: You Have to Cut Out Entire Food Groups to Lose Weight  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s carbs, fat, dairy or gluten, if a diet promises weight loss by eliminating whole food groups, that’s your cue to run for the hills. “Cutting out foods is one of the quickest ways people get stuck in a cycle of restriction and rebound eating,” says Beck. “Your body is designed to protect you from starvation, and in the long term, this approach might damage your relationship with food and make sustainable weight changes much more challenging to achieve,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not only can this practice negatively affect your relationship with food, but it can also cause you to miss out on essential nutrients. “All food groups have a purpose and can align with any health goal,” says &lt;a href="https://dineoncampus.com/cmichdining/meet-your-dietitian" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Brianna Archangeli, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “I tell my clients that balance means eating what you want and adding what you need,” she adds. For example, if you’re craving chocolate, eat a small handful of dark chocolate-covered almonds paired with a sliced apple. The chocolate satisfies the sweet tooth, almonds provide protein and healthy fats, and the apple adds fiber and vitamins.Or maybe you’re in the mood for pasta, but you know your body needs protein and veggies, too. Look no further than our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267768/chicken-spinach-skillet-pasta-with-lemon-parmesan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Chicken &amp;amp; Spinach Skillet Pasta with Lemon &amp;amp; Parmesan&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-5-the-scale-is-the-only-indicator-of-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #5: The Scale is the Only Indicator of Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s easy to fixate on the number on the scale as the ultimate measure of health, especially when weight loss is a goal, but this narrow focus can be misleading. “The scale doesn’t show some of the less-noticeable changes that are happening below the surface—those that are not seen outwardly at first,” explains Archangeli. The scale can go in either direction depending on many factors such as fluid shifting, phase of menstrual cycle, changes in muscle mass and bowel movements. These fluctuations can create a false sense of failure, overshadowing meaningful health improvements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A better goal is to focus on non-scale victories, like feeling stronger or lowering blood pressure,” Achangeli recommends. Maybe you’re sleeping better, perhaps you have more energy, or maybe you’re able to walk longer distances without feeling winded. These non-scale victories are important indicators of health and certainly worth celebrating. “Giving attention to these non-weight-related achievements helps you stay motivated and gives you appreciation for the effort you have put in to enrich your wellbeing,” she says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beck encourages her clients to focus on what helps them feel better, not just what changes the scale. “When you build consistent, supportive habits, your weight will settle where it’s meant to without extreme measures,” says Beck. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-myth-6-you-must-avoid-all-processed-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Myth #6: You Must Avoid All Processed Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Processed and convenience foods often get a bad rap, but not all processed foods are created equal. While some ultra-processed foods are higher in added sugars, fat and calories, making them easy to overeat and potentially challenging for weight management goals, other minimally processed foods are nutrient-dense and time-saving options. For instance, canned beans are a great way to increase fiber and protein intake, both of which increase satiety (feelings of fullness) and aid in weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows you can carefully construct a nutritious meal plan from processed foods, such as whole-grain breads, beans, canned fish and others.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Some of my favorites include frozen fruits and vegetables, canned beans, canned tuna and chicken, precooked rice or lentils and whole grain fortified cereals and crackers,” Archangeli tells &lt;em&gt;EatingWell.&lt;/em&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even ultra-processed foods with more saturated fats and added sugar can occasionally be enjoyed. “All of your favorite foods should be included in your diet in moderation along with other whole, nutrient-dense foods,” says Goodman. “When you cut out your favorite foods, you often feel deprived, making it harder to consume them in moderation.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-tips-to-support-healthy-weight-loss"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Tips to Support Healthy Weight Loss &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat consistent meals and snacks throughout the day. &lt;/strong&gt;“Going too long without eating can lead to energy crashes and overeating later,” says Beck. Regular eating schedules help regulate appetite, mood and metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep and manage stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Poor sleep and chronic stress disrupt hormones that control hunger and fat storage.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“Sometimes improving sleep and stress does more for your health than any diet ever could,” Beck says. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body in ways that feel good. &lt;/strong&gt;Consistent, enjoyable movement supports heart health, energy and mood.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ironically, this is more sustainable when tied to feeling better than earning or burning food.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat protein- and fiber-rich meals you enjoy.&lt;/strong&gt; Meals packed with fiber and protein are more satiating, keeping you full and satisfied for longer. Plus, research shows that a non-restrictive diet high in fiber and protein may promote weight loss.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are ways to approach weight changes without falling into the all-or-nothing mindset that diet culture promotes. “The way I see it is, instead of forcing your body into a certain size, support it with consistent behaviors, a healthier mindset and genuine self-care,” Beck suggests. To promote a healthy weight and overall health, eat consistently throughout the day, incorporate fiber and protein, find movement you enjoy and make it a habit, prioritize sleep and manage stress.

"Chia seeds are rich in a type of omega-3 fatty acid known as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). The body cannot produce ALA its own, so it must be obtained through food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming ALA has been linked to a decreased heart disease risk," a Harvard report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe chia seeds can boost brainpower?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chia-rich nutrition has positive effects on cognitive abilities&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://scholars.direct/Articles/neurodegenerative-disorders/jnd-2-007.pdf?jid=neurodegenerative-disorders" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that chia seed based diet has a positive impact on the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/cognitive-health" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;in humans. This was proven in particular not only by the two tests with high significance but also by the memory task, which indicates that a dietary intake of Salvia hispanica L can positively impact memory abilities. The study published in the Journal of Neurodegenerative Disorders explored to what extent the intake of chia seeds may have favourable effects on schoolchildren, students or Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With all appropriate scientific caution, it appears to be evident thus far that in an aging society, dealing with the increase of cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer’s or dementia, the daily consumption of Salvia hispanica L is highly recommendable," the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use chia seeds as a &lt;keyword id="26753907" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="brain-superfood" source="keywords"&gt;brain superfood&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always soak them first. Chia seeds absorb up to 12 times their weight in water, turning into a gel-like consistency. Soaked chia is easier to digest, which means your body can better absorb all those brain-friendly nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix 2 tablespoons of chia seeds with half a cup of water or almond milk. Let it sit for 20 minutes (or overnight in the fridge).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prepare a chia seed bowl take soaked chia pudding or Greek yogurt + chia gel or oatmeal + stirred-in chia. For toppings you can choose blueberries, walnuts, dark chocolate shavings, banana slices and pumpkin seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quick warnings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you start a chia seed rich breakfast for your brain, here are a few warnings you must know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t eat them dry.

Too much fiber at once can upset your stomach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the next time you see chia seeds and think, “What am I supposed to do with this again?” — just remember, these tiny seeds are packed with brain fuel.

&lt;p&gt;Travelers headed to Fiji this summer better pack more than just their swimsuits — they might want to add some serious bug spray. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) just issued a warning for the tropical hotspot as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/10/us-news/dozens-of-nj-residents-sickened-with-dengue-fever/"&gt;dengue fever cases spike&lt;/a&gt; across the Western Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dengue, a potentially deadly virus spread by mosquitoes, has Fiji’s government &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/25/world-news/suspected-fiji-poisoning-victim-jill-juarez-speaks-out-after-falling-ill-at-five-star-resort/"&gt;on high alert&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“About half the world’s population is now at risk for dengue with an expected 100-400 million infections occurring each year,” the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue"&gt;recent statement,&lt;/a&gt; as countries like Mexico, Canada, and much of the Caribbean and Latin America are also seeing a rise in cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mosquitoes are the ones responsible for spreading this potentially deadly virus. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the agency, dengue fever typically starts with a high fever, headache, severe muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Some people may also feel pain behind their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There isn’t a cure for it, and in mild cases, over-the-counter pain medications can relieve some symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In severe cases — known as dengue hemorrhagic fever — symptoms can escalate to bleeding, breathing difficulties and intense abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Central Division alone has logged over 1,000 dengue cases from January to late March, according to the Fiji Government.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In severe cases, dengue hemorrhagic fever can cause bleeding, breathing issues, and severe abdominal pain. Fiji’s Central Division reported over 1,000 cases from January to late March. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;AFP via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The March surge “is above the expected [dengue] levels for the same period last year,” it &lt;a href="https://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Centre/News/MINISTRY-OF-HEALTH-DECLARES-DENGUE-FEVER-OUTBREAK#:~:text=The%20Central%20Division%20has%20reported,the%20same%20period%20last%20year."&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The World Mosquito Program &lt;a href="https://www.worldmosquitoprogram.org/world-mosquito-day"&gt;dubbed&lt;/a&gt; 2024 the “worst year for dengue on record,” and the numbers aren’t slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, the CDC &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/health/dengue-fever-cases-rising-in-popular-spring-break-locations-cdc/"&gt;marked dengue&lt;/a&gt; as a level 1 health alert, advising travelers to “practice usual precautions.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/25/health/dengue-fever-cases-rising-in-popular-spring-break-locations-cdc/"&gt;Spring and summer travel &lt;/a&gt;coincide with the peak season for dengue in many countries, increasing the risk of both travel-associated and locally acquired cases in the United States,” the CDC wrote in its recent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/notices/han00523.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2F2025%2Fhan00523.html"&gt;health advisory.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tourists are being urged to protect themselves by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and pants, and sleeping in air-conditioned rooms or ones with screened windows.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;And it’s not just Fiji feeling the sting. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC has flagged several other destinations with dengue fever hot spots, including Brazil, Colombia and the Philippines — all of which have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/26/us-news/texas-reports-first-locally-transmitted-case-of-dengue-fever-this-year/"&gt;reported more dengue cases&lt;/a&gt; among American travelers returning to US soil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With climate change fueling unpredictable weather patterns — including heavier rains and flooding —experts fear that the conditions are prime for mosquitoes to breed and spread the virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we continue to release planet-warming gases into our atmosphere through industrial pollution, landfills, and other forms of pollution, dengue and other vector-borne illnesses will only thrive,” the Fiji Government warned.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eyes may be the window to the soul, but a person's biological age could be reflected in their facial characteristics. Investigators from Mass General Brigham developed a deep learning algorithm called "FaceAge" that uses a photo of a person's face to predict biological age and survival outcomes for patients with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;They found that patients with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, on average, had a higher FaceAge than those without and appeared about five years older than their &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronological age&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older FaceAge predictions were associated with worse overall &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/survival+outcomes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;survival outcomes&lt;/a&gt; across multiple cancer types. They also found that FaceAge outperformed clinicians in predicting short-term life expectancies of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results are published in &lt;i&gt;The Lancet Digital Health&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can use &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (AI) to estimate a person's &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological age&lt;/a&gt; from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful," said co-senior and corresponding author Hugo Aerts, Ph.D., director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans for patients and clinicians. How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters—individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer therapy&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;When patients walk into exam rooms, their appearance may give physicians clues about their overall health and vitality. Those intuitive assessments combined with a patient's chronological age, in addition to many other biological measures, may help determine the best course of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, like anyone, physicians may have biases about a person's age that may influence them, fueling a need for more objective, predictive measures to inform care decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that goal in mind, Mass General Brigham investigators leveraged deep learning and facial recognition technologies to train FaceAge. The tool was trained on 58,851 photos of presumed healthy individuals from public datasets. The team tested the algorithm in a cohort of 6,196 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+patients/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; from two centers, using photographs routinely taken at the start of radiotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed that cancer patients appear significantly older than those without cancer, and their FaceAge, on average, was about five years older than their chronological age. In the cancer patient cohort, older FaceAge was associated with worse survival outcomes, especially in individuals who appeared older than 85, even after adjusting for chronological age, sex, and cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimated survival time at the end of life is difficult to pin down but has important treatment implications in cancer care. The team asked 10 clinicians and researchers to predict short-term life expectancy from 100 photos of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;While there was a wide range in their performance, overall, the clinicians' predictions were only slightly better than a coin flip, even after they were given clinical context, such as the patient's chronological age and cancer status. Yet when clinicians were also provided with the patient's FaceAge information, their predictions improved significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed before this technology could be considered for use in a real-world clinical setting. The research team is testing this technology to predict diseases, general health status, and lifespan. Follow-up studies include expanding this work across different hospitals, looking at patients in different stages of cancer, tracking FaceAge estimates over time, and testing its accuracy against plastic surgery and makeup data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyond cancer care or predicting age," said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual's aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — May is Lyme Disease Awareness Month, a time to spotlight a growing health concern around tick bites.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/life/odnr-recommendations-prevent-tick-bites-this-summer/530-54c7ef36-b41e-497f-ba61-6b10a3ee79f7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; is a bacterial infection that can be hard to detect and can be potentially life-changing if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alisha Staley's son had the whole world ahead of him when he was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease years after being bit by a tick.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's been about five and a half years of debilitating symptoms," Staley said. "He's 20 now. This all started when he was 15. If you ask him now, he'd say he still feels like he's 15 because his life stopped at 15."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With thousands of dollars spent on medical testing and treatment, the 20-year-old still battles cognitive and physical pain daily.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He couldn't experience anything like a normal teen experienced. No high school — he was homeschooled. He can't work, he can't go to college. It is very heartbreaking as a mom," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As thousands are diagnosed each year, health experts suggest the disease is hard to detect. Often times, people are not aware they've been bitten by a tick since sometimes, the typical bullseye rash is not present.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's ticks that are in nymph form, and they are teeny, teeny tiny like the size of a freckle or a speck of dirt," Staley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OhioHealth Physician Group family doctor Christopher Johnson spoke about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The hallmark symptoms are fatigue and headache, body aches, lymph nodes that are swollen. That's also what makes Lyme disease hard is those are kind of generalized symptoms we have when we don't feel well," he said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health reports an average of 262 Ohioans get Lyme disease from ticks every year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, complications can arise.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He was unable to eat actual food for a year and a half and was getting all his nutrition through medical-grade drinks," Staley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you suspect you've been bitten by a tick or notice a rash, doctors recommend seeking medical attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Staley, she is encouraging people advocate for your health and seek answers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Be diligent when you are outdoors, so even when you think, 'I wasn't bitten by a tick,' be sure," Staley said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As her son continues to battle the symptoms, Alisha remains optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm still hopeful that there will be a day he is able to go out and accomplish his dreams," she added.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are ways to reduce the risk of getting bit by a tick:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear long pants and tuck them into your socks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use bug spray.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are hiking, stick to the mowed areas and be aware of tall grass, brush and trees.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

Analyzing two large health databases, scientists found that patients on NRTIs had a 6% to 13% annual decrease in Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other HIV drugs, NRTIs block inflammasomes, immune system components implicated in Alzheimer’s development. The researchers now call for clinical trials to test NRTIs — and a new, safer drug called K9 — to determine their potential in preventing Alzheimer’s as cases continue to rise globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; NRTIs were linked to a 6–13% annual reduction in Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unique Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Only NRTIs, not other HIV drugs, showed this protective association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers call for clinical trials to test NRTIs and the new drug K9 for Alzheimer’s prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UVA Health scientists are calling for clinical trials testing the potential of HIV drugs called NRTIs to prevent Alzheimer’s disease after discovering that patients taking the drugs are substantially less likely to develop the memory-robbing condition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers, led by UVA’s Jayakrishna Ambati, MD, previously identified a possible mechanism by which the drugs could prevent Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109678"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows pills." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/nrti-HIV-Alzheimer-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;NRTIs, or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are used to prevent the HIV virus from replicating inside the body. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That promising finding prompted them to analyze two of the nation’s largest health insurance databases to evaluate Alzheimer’s risk among patients prescribed the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one, the risk of developing Alzheimer’s decreased 6% every year the patients were taking the drugs. In the other, the annual decrease was 13%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s estimated that over 10 million people around the world develop Alzheimer’s disease annually,” said Ambati, founding director of UVA’s Center for Advanced Vision Science and the DuPont Guerry III Professor in the University of Virginia School of Medicine’s Department of Ophthalmology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that taking these drugs could prevent approximately 1 million new cases of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;every year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preventing Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NRTIs, or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are used to prevent the HIV virus from replicating inside the body. But Ambati and his team previously determined that the drugs can also prevent the activation of inflammasomes, important agents of our immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, so Ambati and his colleagues wanted to see if patients taking the inflammasome-blocking drugs were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, they reviewed 24 years of patient data contained in the U.S. Veterans Health Administration Database – made up heavily of men – and 14 years of data in the MarketScan database of commercially insured patients, which offers a broader representation of the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They looked for patients who were at least 50 years old and were taking medications for either HIV or hepatitis B, another disease treated with NRTIs. They excluded patients with a previous Alzheimer’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the researchers identified more than 270,000 patients who met the study criteria and then analyzed how many went on to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for factors that might cloud the results, such as whether patients had pre-existing medical conditions, the researchers determined that the reduction in Alzheimer’s risk among patients on NRTIs was “significant and substantial,” they report in a new scientific paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that patients taking other types of HIV medications did not show the same reduction in Alzheimer’s risk as those on NRTIs. Based on that, they say that NRTIs warrant clinical testing to determine their ability to ward off Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, the benefits could be tremendous, as Alzheimer’s rates are climbing dramatically. Nearly 7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s today, but that number is expected to climb to 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, the estimated annual cost of care for Alzheimer’s and other dementias could rise from $360 billion to almost $1 trillion, the Alzheimer’s Association reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have also developed a new inflammasome-blocking drug called K9, which is a safer and more effective version of NRTIs,” Ambati said. “This drug is already in clinical trials for other diseases, and we plan to also test K9 in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have published their findings in Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team consisted of Joseph Magagnoli, Meenakshi Ambati, Tammy Cummings, Joseph Nguyen, Claire C.

                                        &lt;p&gt;The immunization director at North Dakota Health and Human Services says the current measles outbreak is the first the disease has appeared in the state fourteen years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These were the first cases that we've had reported since our last case which was in 2011."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of today, Molly Howell says there are nine confirmed cases of measles, all in unvaccinated individuals from Williams County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says some of the individuals attended schools in Williston while they were infectious. Currently 180 students are isolating for 21 days in an attempt to stop the spread. She says students who did not have at least one dose of measles vaccine were asked to isolate. Howell says measles is extremely infectious, and that 9 out of 10 exposed unvaccinated individuals will develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says vaccination clinics are underway in Williston this evening and tomorrow. She also says HHS has revised immunization recommendations for anyone living in or traveling to Williams County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Usually people don't get the MMR vaccine until they're 12 months old. We are recommending that in Williams County, infants receive the MMR vaccine as early as six months of age. And then also, usually the second dose is given at 4 to 6 years of age before kids go to kindergarten - we are recommending that kids get that dose early as well, so they can receive it if it's been at least 28 days since their first MMR dose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says state health officials have been preparing for potential outbreaks by conducting tabletop exercises with schools, local public health departments and at Health and Human Services. She says fact sheets are ready to go with talking points, the state lab is ready for testing and a dashboard is also ready to keep the public informed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell says MMR vaccines are widely available, so anyone interested is encouraged to speak with their health care providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vaccinated individuals - so if you have one dose of MMR, it's 93 percent effective, and with two doses, it's 97 percent effective - so it's a really good, effective vaccine. Most North Dakotans are vaccinated, so we don't want them panicking about the situation."&lt;/p&gt;

The woman had undergone pioneering gene treatments for a rare degenerative disease, and researchers hoped studying her brain would provide them with invaluable data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ashtyn Fellenz died at age 24 on December 5, 2024. As a child, she was diagnosed with Canavan Disease, a &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/angelman-syndrome-symptoms-colin-farrell-son-cause-b2736546.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rare genetic disorder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rare genetic disorder&lt;/a&gt; that causes the degeneration of the coating that protects nerves and a loss of white matter in the brain, &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/donated-brain-thrown-out-childrens-wisconsin-profoundly-sorry" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to Fox 6;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to Fox 6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Typically, children suffering from the disease progressively lose the ability to move their muscles and effectively become locked in to their own bodies. Without treatment, most children with the disease die before the age of 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2003, when she was three years old, Fellenz underwent experimental surgery that saw a functional gene injected into her brain, with the hopes that it would displace the defective one. While it didn't cure her disease, it did buy her a decade's worth of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr Paola Leone, a professor of Cell Biology at Rowan University, requested that Fellenz's brain be preserved after her death, hoping that it could provide priceless data about both the disease and the body's response to her experimental treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children's Hospital of Wisconsin's Milwaukee campus. The hospital accidentally discarded the brain of Ashtyn Fellenz, a 24-year-old woman who died from Canavan Diease. The brain was meant to be donated for scientific research that could have helped scientists better understand the illness and pioneering genetic treatments that woman had received when she was a child. (Google Maps)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While 16 other children also received similar treatment, the circumstances of her death made her brain especially ideal for preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Leone, most Canavan patients die in their homes, and their brain tissues degrade by the time they can be properly autopsied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fellenz, however, died at Children's Hospital Wisconsin, where doctors could work quickly to save her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The scenario was perfect," Leone told Fox 6. "She was in the hospital. The dry ice was there, ready to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Donating the brain was always the plan following her death, according to her parents, Scott and Arlo Fellenz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was no question that we had to do that,” Scott said. “It was a big part of her legacy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, the secrets of Fellenz's brain will never be uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When she died on December 5, officials at Children's Wisconsin decided that a previous donation consent form signed by her parents was out of date and that they would need to fill out another before the brain could be shipped to Living BioBank at the Children's Hospital in Dayton, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Despite Leone providing Children's Wisconsin with the consent form, a month passed and the sample still hadn’t been sent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On January 13, more than a month after Fellenz's death, Dr Lauren Parsons, Director of Pathology at Children's Wisconsin, wrote an email to Leone thanking her for her "patience" and noting that "holidays and some leadership transitions" had kept the staff tied up, according to Fox 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two more months passed without the brain being sent, Leone said, adding that many of her emails questioning the hold up were left unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scott Fellenz told the broadcaster that Parsons "literally ghosted [Leone] for two months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In March, Arlo Fellenz called the hospital demanding answers. Her call was returned from the hospital's "grief services" workers, who wanted to set up a meeting. She waved off the meeting and demanded they tell her what they needed to say over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The hospital then told the family they had accidentally “disposed” of Fellenz's brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"They tossed out her brain. How can you do that with a brain?" Arlo said during an interview with Fox 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Half of Fellenz's brain did eventually get shipped to Ohio, but Leone was most interested in the information that the other half — the half that had not received the experimental injection — could reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fellenz's father said it felt like he had lost his daughter again. For Leone, the loss also represents a loss of potential knowledge that could have helped people suffering from gene conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This would have just led, just paved the way for any other application of gene therapy into the brain to let us know if gene therapy can persist," she told the broadcaster. "It’s a loss of information that would have been precious and cited for the years to come, for the centuries to come, because this is the one and only specimen, not just for Canavan, for any other gene therapy,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson for Children's Wisconsin said they were “profoundly sorry” for the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"We were honored to support Ashtyn’s family’s wish for her legacy to help others. As we communicated to the family when this error was discovered, and reiterate now, our team is profoundly sorry this happened, and we continue to take steps to reinforce our protocols to help ensure this does not occur again,” they said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The availability of human tissue to support life-changing and lifesaving medical research is critical to offering hope to families. We take seriously our work to support research through proper tissue collection, storage and usage. We are deeply grateful for Ashtyn’s life and for her family’s advocacy and care, and again offer our most sincere regret and apology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When questioned further by Fox 6, the hospital said they have a “comprehensive process” to manage donated tissue, aspects of which were “not followed,” leading to the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Fellenz family have now hired an attorney to represent them, and would use any money to help with Canavan research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 20:20:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOamszdmI2ZGlZWmNvTUtpMU8tQUJOZXlXQ0RacURqTXFfb0paY0ozc2RyMXZnYmx6WllRbWRkUzE3MFRWSjVjSHl2OGRWLUVmdXhuWFVxMlQ1QWZYLUFyOHVoaUZ3SHBnVEhiMFhhdHRjZDUxQmRZQkZrODcwa0RiOGFB</guid></item><item><title>安大略县确诊麻疹病例- 13wham.com | Measles case confirmed in Ontario County - 13wham.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE9semtlVlA2ZHdtc3QtUzl5eHhjdjlVRTZqV3Vmb296QjgtQ054b0twUXp2dUVpOVFyTnh4eUljcUV0LS13MHp0WmwxaHVfVHpjTjd5Zng5VzlTcmFlNDVmZmRKaEluenRmYUhua2tjNE5UVjF5bFVnRjN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_byline__Pmfw index-module_storyBylineContainer__uFq5" id="js-Story-Byline-undefined"&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_bylineTextContainer__MIqD"&gt;&lt;p class="index-module_storyBylineText__yH2g"&gt;by WHAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="index-module_storyDatelineText__wPM6"&gt;Thu, May 8th 2025 at 3:55 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="index-module_storyDatelineText__wPM6"&gt;&lt;span class="index-module_updatedText__YSrj"&gt;Updated &lt;/span&gt;Thu, May 8th 2025 at 3:57 PM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>13wham.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 19:55:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9semtlVlA2ZHdtc3QtUzl5eHhjdjlVRTZqV3Vmb296QjgtQ054b0twUXp2dUVpOVFyTnh4eUljcUV0LS13MHp0WmwxaHVfVHpjTjd5Zng5VzlTcmFlNDVmZmRKaEluenRmYUhua2tjNE5UVjF5bFVnRjN3</guid></item><item><title>大脑信号如何塑造其保护性废物处理网络-神经科学新闻 | How Brain Signals Shape Its Protective Waste Disposal Network - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFB6Q2w2TzVpd2UyaFFNWEdyZ2o2YVMzT21GU1BmME5WRU9POXNiMHYyQXFlOUxZM3NsdzhxVWN1Z0Joem5aYmpBbjFiQXg1Y00xZlZpZzR6QWFpRGphZ1RxenBOU0ZNTmFDS0VQbg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;The brain’s meningeal lymphatic system plays a key role in clearing waste and transporting immune cells, but until now, how it develops was unclear. Using zebrafish and advanced imaging, researchers revealed that neural activity regulates this system by influencing specialized glial cells that release Vegfc, a key growth factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These glial cells, along with fibroblasts that help process Vegfc, guide the formation and precise placement of lymphatic vessels, ensuring they remain confined to the meninges. This neural-glia-fibroblast interaction prevents harmful immune invasion into brain tissue, showcasing the brain’s ability to coordinate its own microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural Activity Drives Development:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased neural activity boosts brain meningeal lymphatic development through Vegfc-expressing glial cells.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glia-Fibroblast Cooperation:&lt;/strong&gt; Vegfc must be processed by fibroblasts to guide lymphatic vessel growth precisely at the brain surface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective Barrier:&lt;/strong&gt; This regulatory axis ensures lymphatic vessels do not invade the brain parenchyma, preventing immune disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over the past decade, intensive studies have shown that the brain’s meningeal lymphatic system acts as the brain’s “waste disposal network,” maintaining homeostasis by clearing metabolic waste and transporting immune cells. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the mechanism underlying its developmental regulation remains unknown. How does this intricate system form, and which cells or signals govern its specific spatial arrangement in the meninges?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109667"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/glymphatic-system-brain-network-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The study shows that the brain acts as a coordinator of its microenvironment, and reveals a novel neural-glia-fibroblast-lymphatic regulatory axis.

Deletion of slc6a11b+ RAs impaired muLEC development, while upregulating these cells’ Vegfc signaling enhanced muLEC development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, researchers found that the activity of slc6a11b+ RAs and their Vegfc expression levels are positively regulated by neural activity. They found that the precursor Vegfc (pro-Vegfc) secreted by slc6a11b+ RAs requires the cooperation of ccbe1+ fibroblasts to be converted into its mature form (mVegfc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-tissue collaboration precisely restricted the distribution of mVegfc to the brain-meningeal interface, ensuring that lymphatic endothelial cells were confined to the brain surface, preventing their invasion into the brain parenchyma, which could cause immune disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows that the brain acts as a coordinator of its microenvironment, and reveals a novel neural-glia-fibroblast-lymphatic regulatory axis. This provides a new framework for understanding how the brain adapts its lymphatic network based on functional needs, and explains why the brain’s meningeal lymphatic system remains confined to the meninges, avoiding invasion of the brain parenchyma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, intervening in this regulatory network may offer new perspectives on the role of the meningeal lymphatic system in neurological diseases and developing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.cas.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Liu Jia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://english.cas.cn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Liu Jia – Chinese Academy of Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.04.008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neural-activity-regulated and glia-mediated control of brain lymphatic development&lt;/a&gt;” by Du Jiulin et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neural-activity-regulated and glia-mediated control of brain lymphatic development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nervous system regulates peripheral immune responses under physiological and pathological conditions, but the brain’s impact on immune system development remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningeal mural lymphatic endothelial cells (muLECs), embedded in the leptomeninges, form an immune niche surrounding the brain that contributes to brain immunosurveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we report that the brain controls the development of muLECs via a specialized glial subpopulation, &lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; radial astrocytes (RAs), a process modulated by neural activity in zebrafish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; RAs, with processes extending to the meninges, govern muLEC formation by expressing vascular endothelial growth factor C (&lt;em&gt;vegfc&lt;/em&gt;). Moreover, neural activity regulates muLEC development, and this regulation requires Vegfc in &lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; RAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, &lt;em&gt;slc6a11b+&lt;/em&gt; RAs cooperate with calcium-binding EGF domain 1 (&lt;em&gt;ccbe1&lt;/em&gt;)+ fibroblasts to restrict muLEC growth on the brain surface via controlling mature Vegfc distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, our study uncovers a glia-mediated and neural-activity-regulated control of brain lymphatic development and highlights the importance of inter-tissue cellular cooperation in development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 19:50:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFB6Q2w2TzVpd2UyaFFNWEdyZ2o2YVMzT21GU1BmME5WRU9POXNiMHYyQXFlOUxZM3NsdzhxVWN1Z0Joem5aYmpBbjFiQXg1Y00xZlZpZzR6QWFpRGphZ1RxenBOU0ZNTmFDS0VQbg</guid></item><item><title>猫禽流感病例激增引发对人类溢出的担忧- CIDRAP | Spike in avian flu cases in cats triggers worry about human spillover - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxNOTRUSGdEVGRzbkVkNF9FczE3RkRkT0JVWUlkSlFlRl9wa1NrbEVOM0RXNUYtdkduRklDaHhaZFFvaWVjYUkyX2haRkZwR0JNYjhHbFVrRFF2TXlVWUd5N1g5SnpwbnRKckd3emdyVWFSLV9VWFR3NldnNko4dzBsa2dpWVlLcEw3SjJDZDV0NHM2SjNlbDMzbVYzY3pFak5scWhaNU5rNTFOeUd1eXhvcHFXSHhxQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Maryland scientists are calling for increased surveillance of avian flu in domestic cats after a global &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ofid/ofaf261/8123920"&gt;&lt;span&gt;review&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 20 years of published data reveals a dramatic uptick in feline infections—and the number of ways cats are being infected—after the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infections among mammalian species in frequent contact with humans should be closely monitored," the researchers wrote yesterday in &lt;em&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/em&gt;. "Domestic cats are susceptible to AIV [avian influenza virus] infection and provide a potential pathway for zoonotic spillover to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team conducted a systematic review of scientific literature from 2004 to 2024 to track the epidemiology and global distribution of AIV in cats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;'New and unknown transmission routes' &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review identified 48 articles that detailed 607 AIV infections in 12 feline species (ranging from pet cats to tigers), 302 of them resulting in death, in 18 countries. Half of the cases were from Asia, followed by Europe (25%) and North America (16.7%). H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b infections were reported in Finland, France, Poland, the United States, Italy, Peru, and South Korea in five species (135 domestic cats, 2 bobcats, and 1 lynx, caracal, and lion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We observed a drastic flux in the number of AIV infections among domestic cats in 2023 and 2024, commensurate with the emergence of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b," which was consistent with the emergence and increased transmission of the clade in birds and mammals, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoos, animal shelters, farms and private rural land were the most common settings of infections in cats. In total, 62.6% of the cases involved domestic cats, and 71.3% of the 423 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed cases were fatal. Most infections were confirmed or suspected to result from bird-to-cat transmission, most often from eating dead pigeons, chickens, or other birds but also from contaminated raw chicken feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Interestingly, cases of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b recently reported by the Colorado Health Department included two indoor-only domestic cats with no known exposure to infected animals," the authors wrote. "This observation raises concerns regarding new and unknown transmission routes of AIV to domestic cats."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;High death rate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 92.3% of feline cases were identified as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), and 7.7% were low-pathogenic avian flu. Among the PCR-positive infections, HPAI made up 99.7% of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 98% of the PCR-confirmed feline infections identified as HPAI H5N1, 33.8% were clade 2.3.4.4b, and 96.4% were domestic cats. Of these cats, the case-fatality rate was 52.8% for H5N1, and 89.6% were clade 2.3.4.4b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the studies that described symptoms, respiratory and neurologic illness were most common and often led to death. Blindness and chorioretinitis (inflammation of the choroid and retina of the eye) were also recently reported in two infected domestic cats that contracted the virus from drinking raw colostrum and milk containing high viral loads from dairy cattle infected with the clade 2.3.4.4b virus. Subclinical feline infections have also been reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This clinical observation suggests that exposure route and dose of AIV might impact disease presentation and severity," the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Infections expected to rise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The avian flu outbreaks that started in February 2024 in dairy cattle are worrisome because most infections in mammals have been in carnivores or omnivores, they said: "The transmission to herbivores is interesting, as avian influenza is often foodborne in mammalian hosts, and tends to result from a new host eating an infected host."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection of ruminants rules out the predation or scavenging route of transmission in this case and suggests that other routes of transmission are occurring, in addition to cattle-to-cattle transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The infection of ruminants rules out the predation or scavenging route of transmission in this case and suggests that other routes of transmission are occurring, in addition to cattle-to-cattle transmission," they added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avian flu has infected 950 people worldwide and killed half of them. From April 2022 (when cumulative data on US human cases started being collected) and January 2025, the country has recorded 66 human infections and 1 death, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The virus has evolved, and the way that it jumps between species—from birds to cats, and now between cows and cats, cats and humans—is very concerning," lead and senior author Kristen Coleman, PhD, said in a University of Maryland &lt;a href="https://sph.umd.edu/news/bird-flu-study-points-risk-another-pandemic"&gt;&lt;span&gt;press release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. "As summer approaches, we are anticipating cases on farms and in the wild to rise again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular concern, she said, is the potential for the virus to enter animal shelters, which could cause large outbreaks potentially involving people, similar to or worse than what happened in New York City in 2016 with a different avian flu strain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cases likely an underestimate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No cases of human-to-human transmission of avian flu have been reported, but the investigators worry that as the virus spreads and evolves, it could become transmissible through the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our future research will involve studies to determine the prevalence of HPAI and other influenza viruses in high-risk cat populations such as dairy barn cats," coauthor and doctoral student Ian Gill Bemis said in the release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of new and unknown transmission routes is worrisome, because cats are not monitored for avian flu, and when testing is performed, it is usually done after death, the authors said. Also, infected cats often experience encephalitis (brain swelling) and other severe symptoms that are often misdiagnosed as rabies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that this phenomenon is underreported in the scientific literature and argue that increased surveillance among domestic cats is urgently needed," they concluded.&lt;span&gt; "As feline-to-human transmission of AIV has been documented, and potential airborne and fomite-mediated transmission implicated, farm and free-roaming cat owners, veterinarians, zoo keepers, and animal shelter volunteers may have a heightened risk of AIV infection during epizootics among birds and mammals."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state Department of Health said that three patients, who are residents of Orange County, are less than 5 years of age and who recently traveled internationally all have tested positive. The DOH is monitoring the cases in coordination with the Orange County Health Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ontario County public health officials also confirmed a measles case from a resident who they say had been exposed outside the United States and tested positive in late March. They have since recovered. The county says that resident isolated at home until they were no longer contagious and no additional exposures or cases have been identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases bring the total number of cases in New York this year to eight. Health officials in early April began advising New Yorkers traveling out of the country or to areas experiencing an outbreak to be fully immunized against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have confirmed more than 930 &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-mmr-vaccine-texas-rfk-ff8e744b19ead87698d7217de02814ee" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; so far this year, more than triple the amount seen in all of 2024, with the majority of cases in Texas and other parts of the Southwest. Officials are also monitoring outbreaks in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All New Yorkers are urged to protect themselves by making sure they're up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines along with other important, lifesaving immunizations and be aware of health advisories when traveling with unvaccinated individuals, especially young children," the DOH said in a release Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some lucky people have rare genetic mutations that enable them to feel well-rested after just four hours of sleep, while the rest of us need around eight hours to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers have identified one of these mutations, named SIK3-N783Y, in a human super-sleeper. The team then studied the mutation in genetically modified mice and found that the mice carrying this mutation also got less shut-eye, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly identified mutation is one of several that researchers have linked to shorter sleep patterns. Scientists hope that by understanding the genetics of natural short sleepers, who seem to thrive on less sleep, they can develop better treatments for sleep disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our bodies continue to work when we go to bed," detoxifying themselves and repairing damage, study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bms.ucsf.edu/people/ying-hui-fu-phd" target="_blank" data-url="https://bms.ucsf.edu/people/ying-hui-fu-phd" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ying-Hui Fu&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist and geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, told &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1216547298855022909&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-025-01402-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep%2Frare-genetic-mutation-lets-some-people-thrive-on-just-4-hours-of-shut-eye" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01402-7" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-025-01402-7&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep%2Frare-genetic-mutation-lets-some-people-thrive-on-just-4-hours-of-shut-eye" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

They found that mice with the mutation slept around 31 minutes less than those without it, and 54 minutes less following a period of sleep deprivation, which the researchers induced by gently handling the mice, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice normally sleep for around &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2022/06/29/teenage-mice-deprived-of-sleep-are-less-outgoing-as-adults/" target="_blank" data-url="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2022/06/29/teenage-mice-deprived-of-sleep-are-less-outgoing-as-adults/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12 hours per day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, much longer than humans, so this new mutation-linked sleep reduction of up to 54 minutes is less than is seen in human subjects with naturally short sleep patterns. The researchers noted that this could be due to mice usually experiencing more fragmented sleep than humans, or the result of their mouse strain being inbred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers still have much to learn about the genetics of natural short sleepers and their nighttime superpower. The new findings highlight that Sik3 is a promising therapeutic target for researchers to explore as they attempt to improve sleep efficiency and satisfaction, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/sleep/science-of-sleep-quiz-how-much-do-you-know-about-sleep-and-dreams"&gt;Science of sleep quiz&lt;/a&gt;: How much do you know about sleep and dreams?&lt;/h2&gt;

				&lt;p&gt;A raccoon attacked a man in a Market Basket parking lot in Portsmouth, New Hampshire on Tuesday, officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portsmouth Police received a report from a third party that a young male was attacked by a raccoon in the vicinity of Market Basket, Sergeant Jordan Wells told Boston.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the scene, the raccoon and the alleged victim were not present when police arrived. However, roughly an hour later, police said they got a call from the man, who was receiving medical care. He is currently in stable condition, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, police were not able to locate the raccoon, according to authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is “no definitive information” confirming that the raccoon was rabid, Wells said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not uncommon to see raccoons in the daytime during the spring, according to Wells. Just earlier this week, police were notified about a potentially rabid raccoon near Hannaford’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This time of year is when you have all the female raccoons that will be out there in the day foraging for food sometimes,” he said. “They can be extremely aggressive.”&lt;/p&gt;

Deep sleep is when the trash collector rolls through the body and collects trash. If you don’t hit that deep sleep window, trash accumulates in your body. People think if you go to bed at 2 and wake up at 11 that you somehow make up for lost sleep. You don’t. The sleep patterns are different, that’s why being on time—and consistent—is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to ask you about my classic combo of three drinks and a cigarette.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I think those things are going to make you less happy, less robust, less emotionally vibrant, and dull your senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you ever drink at any point in your life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really.

I got this years ago before I started this endeavor. Large tattoos increase your risk of skin cancer and lymphoma by 137% and 173%, if they’re larger than the palm of your hand. Tattoos generally, about a 33% increase. But, that was a study with 2,600 Danish twins, and only 16 or so were discordant behaviors. It’s a relatively small study, so it’s suggestive, not conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But yeah, tattoos with bad inks create cancer risk. There are safe inks to use. If you’re going to get a tattoo, just do it smaller than 2x2 and get a safe ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want you to guess how old I am based on looking at me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ooh, brutal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m 29.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You look great.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Mediterranean diet focuses on whole, minimally processed foods and offers numerous health benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stocking up on canned foods is a convenient and affordable way to follow the Mediterranean diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When buying canned foods, look for those that are low in sodium and have minimal ingredients.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Mediterranean diet is widely considered one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world. This diet, inspired by the traditional cuisines of countries that border the Mediterranean Sea, emphasizes whole, minimally processed foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, legumes and healthy fats. Studies have consistently linked the Mediterranean diet to numerous health benefits, including a reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers and cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the easiest and most affordable ways to follow a Mediterranean-style eating pattern is by incorporating canned foods. Canned foods offer convenience, a longer shelf life and year-round accessibility, making them ideal for busy lifestyles and budget-conscious households. Many canned food items are just as nutritious as their fresh or frozen counterparts. Canned foods, especially fruits and vegetables, are typically harvested when they are at their peak ripeness and nutritional quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The canning process, which involves heating and sealing, helps lock in those nutrients and preserve quality over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are six Mediterranean diet–friendly canned foods to keep stocked in your pantry, plus easy ways to add them to your everyday meals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913550/are-chickpeas-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; are a staple legume in the Mediterranean diet and a key ingredient in recipes like hummus, stews and grain bowls. One cup of canned chickpeas provides about 11 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber, supporting digestive health, satiety and blood sugar balance.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These legumes may also support heart health. One study found that weekly intake of legumes was linked with improved metabolic markers and reduced cardiovascular risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Add a serving of chickpeas to salads, soups or your favorite pasta dish.

Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that becomes more bioavailable when cooked. It has been shown to help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, contributing to heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Canned tomatoes can be used in a variety of ways.

Sardines are also one of the few foods naturally rich in both vitamin D and calcium, making them beneficial for bone health. The American Heart Association recommends consuming fatty fish like sardines at least twice a week to help reduce the risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To incorporate sardines into your meals, try pairing them with whole-grain toast or tossing them into salads or pasta dishes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Artichokes are rich in antioxidants, particularly polyphenols and flavonoids, which help protect the body against oxidative stress and free radical damage—both of which are linked to chronic conditions like heart disease, cancer and cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These compounds support the body’s natural defense systems by reducing inflammation and promoting cellular health. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7961966/health-benefits-of-artichokes-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Artichokes&lt;/a&gt; are also a source of folate and magnesium, which are key nutrients in supporting heart health.

They’re also a surprising source of fiber. These nutrients contribute to heart health and help to reduce inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Canned olives are convenient and shelf-stable, making it easy to include this Mediterranean staple in your diet. Just note that because they’re high in sodium, you’ll want to be mindful of portion sizes and rinse them under water before enjoying them. For a heart-healthy boost of flavor, add olives to pasta dishes, salads and spreads or have them as a snack with cheese.

A ½-cup serving provides around 9 grams of protein and 6 grams of fiber, along with iron, potassium and magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; White beans are also a good source of resistant starch, which can support gut health and may improve insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These mild-flavored beans are extremely versatile and can be added to soups or mashed into a spread with lemon and garlic.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for ways to make following a Mediterranean-inspired diet more convenient, keep these tips in mind the next time you’re at the store.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Look for Low-Sodium Options &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many canned products contain added sodium as a preservative. Choose “low-sodium” or “no salt added” versions to better align with the Mediterranean diet’s heart-healthy principles. Rinsing canned beans and vegetables under cold water can also reduce the sodium content.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Opt for products with minimal ingredients. Try to avoid canned foods with added sugars and unnecessary preservatives or fillers to stay in line with the Mediterranean emphasis on whole, minimally processed foods.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re buying canned tuna or sardines, look for those packed in olive oil rather than soybean or vegetable oil. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-olive-oil-good-for-you-8766002" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Olive oil&lt;/a&gt; is a cornerstone of the Mediterranean diet and contributes heart-healthy fats.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods often go on sale and can be stored for long periods. Stocking up during promotions allows you to build a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882943/3-ingredient-mediterranean-dinners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;pantry&lt;/a&gt; full of nutritious options that support balanced meals without breaking the bank.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods can be a nutritious, affordable and convenient way to support a Mediterranean-style eating pattern. From chickpeas to sardines, these items make it easy to prepare healthful meals with minimal prep.

    &lt;p&gt;Writing in the journal Jama Network Open, Dr Brittany Krzyzanowski said: “These findings suggest that pesticides applied to golf courses may play a role in the incidence of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/dementia/parkinsons-progress/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; for nearby residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health policies to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination and airborne exposure from pesticides on golf courses may help reduce risk of Parkinson’s disease in nearby neighbourhoods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall chance of developing Parkinson’s is small, with about 0.005 per cent of people in their 30s diagnosed, rising to about 1.7 per cent of people in their 80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that exposure to pesticides such as organophosphates raise the risk of the condition, and in 2011 the US National Institutes of Health warned that rotenone and paraquat in particular multiply the risk of Parkinson’s by 2.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That study found the pesticides can inhibit the function of the mitochondria, the structure responsible for making energy in the cell, as well as causing oxidative stress that can harm cellular structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Seven pesticides in groundwater&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also evidence that pesticides from golf courses can pollute groundwater. A study of water courses surrounding four different golf courses in Cape Cod, Massachusetts discovered that they were contaminated with seven different pesticides including those linked to Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But although there has been anecdotal evidence that living near golf courses may increase the chance of Parkinson’s and cancer, there have been no major studies until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research looked at nearly 4,500 people who lived in the vicinity of golf courses, including 418 Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found a clear link for those living within three miles of a golf course, with the risk decreasing as people moved farther away. The effects were strongest in residential areas that shared their groundwater with a golf course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain has traditionally used fewer pesticides on golf courses than the US, and recently banned the most harmful chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

And Randall who was also born on May 11th, but died on August 7th–a +87 day difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/explain.webp" alt="A diagram showing three individuals (Gus, Gretchen, and Randall) and their relationship to a reference point (day 0). Gus is shown at 0 day difference, Gretchen at -9 days, and Randall at +87 days, represented by small squares connected to a vertical dotted line." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get the picture. We arrange their relative death dates from -182 to +182 (days before and after birthday, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/explain2.webp" alt="A simplified timeline showing three people (Gretchen, Gus, and Randall) positioned along a horizontal axis from -182 to +182 days. Small squares mark their positions, with Gus at day 0, Gretchen slightly to the left, and Randall halfway to the right." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do this for each person and count the number of times each difference occurs. If we expect death dates to be random relative to birthdays, this should look pretty flat. Instead, we can see variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/all-2000.webp" alt="A bar chart showing daily death counts before and after a reference point (marked with a birthday cake icon). The x-axis spans from -182 to +182 days. Gray vertical bars represent daily death counts averaging around 150, with minor fluctuations across the entire time period. The zero-day red bar is one of the tallest." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting…But what we care about most is how many observations are on the zero day difference. Is there a spike? &lt;strong&gt;Enhance!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/enhance.webp" alt="A bar chart showing “183 birthday deaths” with the peak highlighted in red. The x-axis spans from -20 to +20 days difference, with 0 at center. The average is noted as 156. Gray bars represent daily death counts around 150-160." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;strong&gt;17% excess birthday deaths&lt;/strong&gt; compared to the average day difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We did it, we found the birthday effect!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="sample"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="big"&gt;But…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at this. Did you notice that just 12 days after birthday deaths is nearly as high? Does that mean there is a “12-days-after-a-birthday effect,” too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/other.webp" alt="A bar chart showing “183 birthday deaths” with the peak highlighted in red. The x-axis spans from -20 to +20 days difference, with 0 at center. The bar +12 days after is highlighted in teal and has a value of 181." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe. But this could be a &lt;strong&gt;sample size problem.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s like trying to detect a rigged coin with just 10 flips. Getting six heads instead of the expected five wouldn’t prove much–you’d need more tests. The same applies to our data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;57,010 observations might seem like a lot, but not when you spread them over 365 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there will always be some natural variation due to random chance since this is real life. So, &lt;strong&gt;is the zero day difference due to random chance or not?&lt;/strong&gt; To answer this, we need to first know how much the data vary from the average. We start by figuring out how spread out the data is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are all day differences sorted by magnitude. You can see that birthdays (day difference = 0) have one of the highest death frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/sorted.webp" alt="A sorted bar chart titled “sorted day differences” showing values from 119 deaths to the highest values near 200. The average is marked as 153. Eight red bars at the right end are labeled “8 days with 180-185 deaths” with the highest bar marked with “183” and a cake icon." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see the broader trend, let’s group our day difference values into buckets of five. In the chart above, there are &lt;strong&gt;eight day differences with values between 180-185&lt;/strong&gt;, including birthday deaths. That makes up one bucket. We tally up the count for all other buckets, and get the histogram below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/histogram.webp" alt="A histogram showing “distribution of death counts” with x-axis labeled “buckets of values” from 115-120 to 190-195. The middle bucket highest frequency is labeled 58. The 180-185 bucket is highlighted in red labeled as “8”, and includes a cake icon pointing at it with “183 deaths.”" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice a balanced-looking, slight bell shape–this is important. It is called a &lt;strong&gt;normal distribution&lt;/strong&gt; or “bell curve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we measure the spread,  we find that many values–about 68%–fall within a certain range (+/- 13) of the average (156 deaths). This range (143-169) is what statisticians call &lt;strong&gt;one standard deviation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This 68% pattern is a key feature of bell curves–&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;a mathematical rule&lt;/a&gt; that shows up everywhere in nature and statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/stddev.webp" alt="A histogram showing “approximate standard deviations” with death counts distributed across value buckets from 115-120 to 190-195. Areas are color-coded to show: gray for within 1 standard deviation, teal for 1+ standard deviation, and red for 2+ standard deviations." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect most (95%) values to fall within two standard deviations. That means anything from 130-182 is normal variation–expected random noise in our data. Birthday deaths are a hair higher, at just over 2 standard deviations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This normal variation in the data makes it hard to spot subtle patterns–like the birthday effect. We need a large enough sample to see if that birthday spike is truly meaningful or just random noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I got data of every person who died in Massachusetts from 1990-2024. When we look at more years, we can see the noise factor play out more clearly. Some years, like 1999, will show a strong birthday effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/all-1999.webp" alt="A bar chart showing daily death counts before and after a reference point (marked with a birthday cake icon). The x-axis spans from -182 to +182 days. Gray vertical bars represent daily death counts averaging around 150, with minor fluctuations across the entire time period. The zero-day red bar is one of the tallest." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other years, like 2002, might show nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/all-2002.webp" alt="A bar chart showing daily death counts before and after a reference point (marked with a birthday cake icon). The x-axis spans from -182 to +182 days. Gray vertical bars represent daily death counts averaging around 150, with minor fluctuations across the entire time period. The zero-day red bar is one of the shortest." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if we combine all 35 years I have (1990-2024), with nearly 2 million observations–5,358 per day difference–random fluctuations start to cancel out. This improves our ability to be more confident in our findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/all.webp" alt="A bar chart showing daily death counts before and after a reference point (marked with a birthday cake icon). The x-axis spans from -182 to +182 days. Gray vertical bars represent daily death counts averaging around 5,000, with minor fluctuations across the entire time period. The zero-day red bar is one of the tallest." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For good measure, let’s enhance this too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/enhance-all.webp" alt="A bar chart showing “5,728 birthday deaths” with the peak highlighted in red. The x-axis spans from -20 to  20 days difference, with 0 at center. The average is noted as 5,358. Gray bars represent daily death counts around 5,300." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we see &lt;strong&gt;6.9% excess birthday deaths&lt;/strong&gt;. This is more promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="significance"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="big"&gt;But…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How confident can we be that our results are &lt;strong&gt;statistically significant,&lt;/strong&gt; and how do we measure this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Z-Tests and p-values baby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/chalkboard.webp" loading="lazy" alt="screenshot from A Beautiful Mind of a person and a chalkboard"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test significance, we start with the &lt;strong&gt;null hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;–we assume there is nothing special happening here. In our case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“There is no birthday effect. Deaths occur randomly throughout the year regardless of birthdays.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we ask ourselves, how likely would we see this birthday spike by pure chance alone if our null hypothesis were true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just need three ingredients to calculate a z-score: actual number of deaths (observed), daily average (expected), and how much it varies (standard deviation). Hey! We know all about the last one now, so we can put it to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(observed - expected) / std. dev. = z-score&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plugging in the values from our 1,955,588 observations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(5,728 - 5,358) / 74 = 5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;z-score of 5&lt;/strong&gt; is incredibly strong, which tells us this is well beyond normal variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Converting this to a &lt;strong&gt;p-value&lt;/strong&gt; tells us the probability of seeing this extreme result, if the null hypothesis were true and there was no birthday effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our p-value is ~0.000001, meaning there’s less than a 0.0001% chance we’d see this birthday effect if deaths were actually random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/chance.webp" loading="lazy" alt="screenshot from Dumb and Dumber “you’re telling me there’s a chance”"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since that chance is so low, it is a near-certainty that this isn’t due to normal variation. Statisticians typically consider any p-value below 0.05 to be significant enough to reject the null hypothesis, and we’re &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; below that threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, the birthday effect is real &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; statistically significant!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="seasonality"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="big"&gt;But…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(*sighs* coming from you)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Births and deaths aren’t evenly spread throughout the year. Winter months see more deaths from flu and cold weather, while birth patterns have their own seasonal rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/months.webp" alt="A bar chart showing births and deaths per month over a year, from January to December. Births (in teal) range from 160,802 to 165,570 per month, displayed as bars extending downward. Deaths (in red) range from 149,606 to 187,356 per month, displayed as bars extending upward. January and June are labeled on the x-axis. The chart shows more deaths than births in most months, with January having the highest death count at 187,356." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take January in Massachusetts: 8.5% of people are born then, but 9.6% of all deaths happen in January. This means January-born people would naturally show &lt;strong&gt;13% more birthday deaths&lt;/strong&gt; just because January is a high-mortality month–regardless of some birthday effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9.6% ÷ 8.5% = &lt;strong&gt;1.13&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find a true birthday effect, we need to adjust for these seasonal patterns. Otherwise, we’re just measuring when people tend to die anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to control for seasonality is to compare expected deaths to observed deaths on birthdays, &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; accounting for seasonal patterns. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a tiny world of &lt;strong&gt;100 people and just three days a year&lt;/strong&gt;: day A, day B, and day C. Here is how many people were born and died on each day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/world.webp" alt="A table titled “In a three-day year world with 100 people” showing births and deaths by day. Day A: 40 births, 40 deaths; Day B: 30 births, 40 deaths; Day C: 30 births, 20 deaths. The data is color-coded with births in teal and deaths in red." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since we are using 100 people, these numbers also represent the percent of people who are born and die on each day. If birth dates and death dates were completely unrelated (our null hypothesis), what would we expect to see?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone born on day A (40 people), there’s a 40% chance they’ll die on day A, a 40% chance on day B, and a 20% chance they’ll die on day C. To calculate the chance someone is born and dies on a given day, we simply multiply them together:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;birth %  × death % = % of all people&lt;/code&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for day A people, there is a 16% chance they die on their birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;code&gt;40% × 40% = 16%&lt;/code&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/grid.webp" alt="A grid labeled “birth/death day combination %” showing the percentage distribution between birth days (A, B, C) on the y-axis and death days (A, B, C) on the x-axis. An annotation reads “40% × 40% = 16%” connecting to the A-A cell. The grid shows percentages for combinations of birth days (A, B, C) and death days (A, B, C). Values in the grid include: A-A: 16%, A-B: 16%, A-C: 8%, B-A: 12%, B-B: 12%, B-C: 6%, C-A: 12%, C-B: 12%, C-C: 6%." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can calculate the expected percentage for each birth-death combination for all nine day possibilities, which represents 100% of all outcomes. What we’re most interested in is the diagonal of this grid–where birth day equals death day. These are our birthday deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/diagonal.webp" alt="A grid labeled “birth/death day combination %” showing the percentage distribution between birth days (A, B, C) on the y-axis and death days (A, B, C) on the x-axis. Values in the grid include: A-A: 16% (boxed), A-B: 16%, A-C: 8%, B-A: 12%, B-B: 12% (boxed), B-C: 6%, C-A: 12%, C-B: 12%, C-C: 6% (boxed)." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grid basically says: “Even though more people die on day A, we’re taking that into account for each specific birthday, so any excess deaths on birthdays must be due to something else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding these up, without any birthday effect, we’d &lt;strong&gt;expect 34% of people&lt;/strong&gt; to die on their birthday by pure chance in this tiny world. This gives us a baseline to compare against that accounts for seasonal effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s bring this back to the real world with 365 days and our Massachusetts data. We'll use the same approach, just with a much, much bigger grid (133,225 combinations). After plugging in the numbers, we get an expected value of 5,355 birthday deaths, and observation of 5,728 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="big"&gt;There are 7.0% excess birthday deaths in Massachusetts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means we can &lt;strong&gt;definitively&lt;/strong&gt; say there is still an effect that has nothing to do with seasonal factors, but rather, ✨something else. ✨&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="theories"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="big"&gt;But…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is there a birthday effect at all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One popular idea centers on the psychological impact of death postponement versus anniversary reaction: Does the looming birthday cause people to postpone death until after they’ve celebrated their special day, or does the birthday itself somehow trigger mortality?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other studies have shown a significant spike in deaths on and near birthdays. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953614008120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Peña’s study&lt;/a&gt; of 25 million U.S. deaths (1998-2011) found a 6.7% excess of birthday deaths, while &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S104727971200110X" target="_blank" rel="noferrer"&gt;Ajdacic-Gross’s study&lt;/a&gt; of Swiss deaths (1969-2008) found a 13.8% excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peña noted that “no evidence is found of dips in average excess death rates in a ±10 day neighborhood around birthdays that could offset the spikes on birthdays.” Like these other large studies, I didn't find any significance with a postponement effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies also stratify the data to examine differences across gender, age, or cause of death. Unlike Peña, who found that “younger people have greater average excess death rates on birthdays,” I actually found that the birthday effect was stronger in older versus younger people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only additional noteworthy finding after stratification was that accidental deaths showed 35% excess deaths on birthdays in Massachusetts, supporting a theory around celebratory behavior. As Ajdacic-Gross observed on deaths by accident and suicide, “the most plausible interpretation is related to the use of alcohol, which is a well-known risk factor in suicidal behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong class="big"&gt;So what have we learned?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The birthday effect shows that mortality isn’t just about biology and random chance; it’s influenced by social constructs and personal significance. This research reminds us that data can reveal hidden patterns in human experience that we might otherwise miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differing results across studies highlight how methodological choices—from sample selection to statistical analysis—can dramatically shape our findings. When studying something as basic as birthdays and death, how we approach the problem shapes what answers we find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section id="method"&gt;&lt;img src="assets/sketches/cake-ghost.webp" alt="drawing of a birthday cake and a ghost below it" class="emoji"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data and methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts death data was obtained via FOIA from the Registry of Vital Records and Statistics (RVRS). Data excludes deaths where the age is under one and half years old, birth or death dates on February 29, and missing birth or death dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Note: a circular calendar was used to compare dates on 365 days and excluded leap days. This approach was standard across studies in order to simplify calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Pudding</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 16:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWEFVX3lxTE9OckxPRUU2UzQ3NVllTU53NXhQMXdLclNZeDFCdEI0eFpQb19pdEd1ekc5Sll1SG94elRCRGVfUU9XczJoOTdydnI4SmtoR3JJR1BWNXFGN3U</guid></item><item><title>呼吸道合胞体的中期评估... -疾病控制和预防中心| CDC （ .gov ） | Interim Evaluation of Respiratory Syncytial ... - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | CDC (.gov)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYEFVX3lxTFBOcXJ2N3R5emg0dFJLR1lBaHgzN1R2c3JSQ1RlUEZPNW1rbm1nWGpDM3VoaFVybG9SZ0EwOE1zSUdrMi1WU2EtQThBNzVKWmE0RUl5WHBFaWdCUkZDWXFURA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="d-flex flex-wrap d-md-block"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is already known about this topic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody, help prevent infant RSV-associated hospitalizations; these products became widely available in the United States during the 2024–25 RSV season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is added by this report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this ecologic analysis comparing RSV-associated hospitalization rates among infants aged 0–7 months during 2024–25 with those during pre–COVID-19 pandemic RSV seasons in two surveillance networks, rates during 2024–25 were lower by an estimated 28% and 43%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the implications for public health practice?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first RSV season with widespread availability of maternal vaccine and nirsevimab, RSV-associated hospitalization rates among infants were lower than in prepandemic seasons. Effective health care planning is needed to protect infants as early in the RSV season as possible through maternal vaccination during pregnancy or infant receipt of nirsevimab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="abstract" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Abstract"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine and nirsevimab, a long-acting monoclonal antibody for infants aged 0–7 months and children aged 8–19 months who are at increased risk for severe RSV disease, became widely available for prevention of severe RSV disease among infants and young children during the 2024–25 RSV season. To evaluate the association between availability of these products and infant and child RSV-associated hospitalization rates, the rates among children aged &amp;lt;5 years were compared for the 2024–25 and 2018–20 RSV seasons using data from the RSV-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) and New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN). Among infants aged 0–7 months (eligible for protection with maternal vaccination or nirsevimab), 2024–25 RSV-associated hospitalization rates were lower compared with 2018–20 pooled rates (estimated relative rate reductions of 43% [RSV-NET: 95% CI = 40%–46%] and 28% [NVSN: 95% CI = 18%–36%]). The largest estimated rate reduction was observed among infants aged 0–2 months (RSV-NET: 52%, 95% CI = 49%–56%; NVSN: 45%, 95% CI = 32%–57%) and during peak hospitalization periods (December–February). These findings support Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations for maternal vaccination or nirsevimab to protect against severe RSV disease in infants and highlight the importance of implementing the recommendations to protect infants as early in the RSV season as possible, before peak transmission, and for infants born during the RSV season, within the first week of life, ideally during the birth hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="introduction" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Introduction"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of hospitalization among U.S. infants, with infants aged 0–2 months at the highest risk for hospitalization (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). Two effective products for preventing infant RSV hospitalizations, maternal RSV vaccine&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;) (administered during weeks 32–36 of pregnancy during September–January in most of the United States) and nirsevimab&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;) (a long-acting monoclonal antibody for all infants aged 0–7 months in their first RSV season and children aged 8–19 months in their second RSV season at increased risk for severe RSV disease) were introduced during the 2023–24 U.S. RSV season**&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;–&lt;i&gt;5&lt;/i&gt;). To assess a possible association between availability of these products and RSV-associated hospitalizations, this ecologic analysis compared pediatric RSV-associated hospitalization rates from two U.S. active surveillance systems, the RSV-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) and New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN), during 2024–25 and 2018–20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="methods" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Methods"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Sources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSV-NET conducts active population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; RSV-associated hospitalizations identified through clinical testing among catchment-area residents of all ages in approximately 300 hospitals in 161 counties across 13 states.&lt;sup&gt;¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;*** NVSN conducts active, population-based surveillance for acute respiratory illness (ARI) among hospitalized children aged &amp;lt;18 years at seven U.S. medical centers&lt;sup&gt;†††&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;); respiratory specimens from all enrolled children are tested for RSV.&lt;sup&gt;§§§&lt;/sup&gt; RSV-NET and NVSN have both used standardized case definitions and active case finding since 2016 and 2000, respectively (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;), and both collect demographic data through medical record abstraction. NVSN also conducts parent interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis included RSV-NET and NVSN RSV-associated hospitalization data from children aged &amp;lt;5 years during the 2018–19 and 2019–20 RSV seasons (October–April, representing typical RSV seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic) and the 2024–25 season (October–February data); 2018–19 and 2019–20 data were pooled to generate 2018–20 data. The 2020–21 through 2023–24 RSV seasons were excluded because the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in atypical RSV seasonality and circulation (&lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Data Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hospitalization rates for three groups with varying eligibility for RSV prevention products were analyzed: 1) infants aged 0–7 months eligible for protection through maternal RSV vaccine or nirsevimab, overall and in prespecified subgroups of infants aged 0–2 months, who are at highest risk for RSV-associated hospitalization (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;) and infants aged 3–7 months; 2) children aged 8–19 months entering their second RSV season, some of whom might have been nirsevimab-eligible based on risk conditions&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt;; and 3) children aged 20–59 months, who were ineligible for either product. Weekly (RSV-NET)**** or monthly (NVSN)&lt;sup&gt;††††&lt;/sup&gt; RSV-associated hospitalizations per 1,000 children aged &amp;lt;5 years were calculated using U.S. population denominators (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;); cumulative rates for all seasons were estimated through February to ensure consistent comparisons. RSV-NET rates were adjusted to account for RSV underdetection related to testing practices and test sensitivity using an established multiplier approach&lt;sup&gt;§§§§&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;6&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;8&lt;/i&gt;). NVSN rates were adjusted for enrollment rates, weeks with &amp;lt;7 surveillance days, test sensitivity, and hospital market share&lt;sup&gt;¶¶¶¶&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;). A sensitivity analysis excluding the Houston, Texas site from NVSN data (approximately 20% of overall enrolled children) was performed because RSV circulation and associated hospitalizations increased in Houston in September 2024, before RSV prevention products were widely administered there (&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/177897#tabs-3"&gt;Supplementary Figure&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were estimated, and differences were assessed with Z-tests or &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-tests comparing cumulative 2024–25 hospitalization rates with pooled 2018–20 rates.***** Relative hospitalization rate reduction (RRR) was estimated as (1 − RR) x 100. Trends and differences by age were compared using Cochran-Armitage trends and Pearson’s chi-square tests, respectively. Data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.&lt;sup&gt;†††††&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="results" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Results"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Characteristics of Children Hospitalized for RSV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 18,389 RSV-associated hospitalizations (15,405 in RSV-NET and 2,984 in NVSN) were identified among children aged &amp;lt;5 years; these included 11,681 during 2018–20 and 6,708 during 2024–25. Median patient age was 6.7 months and 14.7 months in RSV-NET (p&amp;lt;0.001) and 6.3 months and 12.7 months in NVSN (p&amp;lt;0.04), in the earlier versus later seasons, respectively (&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/177897#tabs-3"&gt;Supplementary Table 1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;RSV-Associated Hospitalization Rates Among Infants Aged 0–7 Months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cumulative RSV-associated hospitalization rates among infants aged 0–7 months were lower during 2024–25 compared with 2018–20: 8.5 versus 15.0 per 1,000 children in RSV-NET, and 10.7 versus 14.8 per 1,000 children in NVSN (&lt;a id="T1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#T1_down"&gt;Table&lt;/a&gt;). These differences were associated with estimated hospitalization rate reductions of 43% in RSV-NET and 28% in NVSN during 2024–25 (p&amp;lt;0.001 for both). Estimated rate reductions were largest during December–February (&lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/177897#tabs-3"&gt;Supplementary Table 2&lt;/a&gt;). In a sensitivity analysis of NVSN data excluding Houston (because of earlier RSV season onset before prevention product availability), the apparent reduction in RSV-associated hospitalization rates among infants aged 0–7 months during 2024–25 was larger (56%) (Table).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest cumulative rate differences during 2024–25 compared with 2018–20 were observed among infants aged 0–2 months. Estimated reductions in RSV-associated hospitalization rates among infants aged 0–2 months were 52% for RSV-NET and 45% for NVSN (p&amp;lt;0.001 for all); the NVSN rate reduction was larger (71%) with Houston excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;RSV-Associated Hospitalization Rates Among Children Aged 8–19 and 20–59 Months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among children aged 8–19 and 20–59 months, RSV-associated hospitalization rates were higher during 2024–25 than during 2018–20. Differences in weekly and monthly rates between 2024–25 and 2018–20 among all age groups were comparable to observed differences in cumulative rates (&lt;a id="F1_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F1_down"&gt;Figure 1&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a id="F2_up"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="#F2_down"&gt;Figure 2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="order-4 w-100"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a id="discussion" class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2024–25, the first U.S. RSV season with widespread availability of maternal RSV vaccine and nirsevimab, analyses of two population-based surveillance networks demonstrated significantly lower RSV-associated hospitalization rates among infants aged 0–7 months who were eligible for RSV prevention products, with estimated rate reductions of 28% and 43% compared with rates during the pooled 2018–20 RSV seasons. The largest estimated rate reductions in hospitalization occurred among infants aged 0–2 months (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates during 2024–25 compared with 2018–20 among children in older age groups, who were largely ineligible for RSV prevention products, suggest a more severe 2024–25 season overall and indicate that observed reductions in hospitalization rates among younger infants might be underestimated. Increased hospitalization rates among these older children also suggest that reduced infant hospitalization rates were likely due to RSV prevention products, rather than to changes in RSV circulation, testing practices, or health care–seeking behavior. The apparent reduction in RSV-associated infant hospitalization rates temporally associated with widespread availability of two options to protect eligible infants (i.e., maternal RSV vaccination and nirsevimab administration to eligible infants) suggests that most severe RSV disease among infants aged 0–7 months is preventable, consistent with findings in European countries (&lt;i&gt;9&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt;10&lt;/i&gt;). In this analysis, rate decreases were largest among infants aged 0–2 months, the group at highest risk for RSV-associated hospitalization (&lt;i&gt;1&lt;/i&gt;). The findings suggest the importance of protecting infants born during the RSV season through either maternal vaccination during pregnancy or nirsevimab administration in the first week of life, ideally during the birth hospitalization (&lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National immunization survey data indicate the estimated proportion of U.S. infants aged 0–7 months protected by either maternal vaccination or nirsevimab increased during the 2024–25 RSV season, from 30% in October 2024 to 66% in February 2025,&lt;sup&gt;§§§§§&lt;/sup&gt; coinciding with the 2024–25 RSV-associated hospitalization rate reductions in both surveillance networks, with the largest monthly reductions occurring during peak hospitalization periods. In addition, reduction in hospitalization rates among NVSN infants aged 0–7 months were larger after excluding Houston, where prevention products were not widely available before RSV season onset. These results support the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to optimize population-level impact by administering RSV prevention products as early as possible in the season (i.e., before peak RSV transmission) on the basis of local epidemiology (&lt;i&gt;3&lt;/i&gt;). Increased and earlier use of RSV prevention products during future seasons might lead to even larger reductions in pediatric RSV–associated hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, this was an ecologic analysis and does not include individual-level data on coverage with RSV prevention products; therefore, causality could not be assessed. Second, hospitalization rate adjustments accounting for RSV underdetection or underenrollment might be insufficient. Third, RSV-NET and NVSN catchment areas might not be nationally representative. Finally, interim results might underestimate changes during complete RSV seasons or seasons with higher product coverage. However, relatively consistent findings from two geographically diverse, population-based surveillance networks provide reliable support for the population-level impacts of RSV prevention products on U.S. pediatric RSV-associated hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="h3"&gt;Implications for Public Health Practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the first RSV season with widespread availability of prevention products, RSV-associated hospitalization rates were significantly lower compared with those during pre–COVID-19 pandemic seasons among infants aged 0–7 months. Reductions were largest during peak hospitalization periods. These findings highlight the importance of effective annual health care planning to implement Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ recommendations for RSV prevention products and ensure parents can protect infants as early as possible in the RSV season, either through maternal vaccination during pregnancy or infant receipt of nirsevimab. For infants born during the RSV season who are not protected through maternal vaccination, nirsevimab should be administered within the first week of life, ideally during the birth hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

* RSV-NET conducts active population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations identified through clinical testing among catchment-area residents of all ages in approximately 300 hospitals in 161 selected counties in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; Hospitalization data were included from October–April 2018–20 and October–February 2024–25.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;§&lt;/sup&gt; Cumulative laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations per 1,000 children aged &amp;lt;5 years as of February 28 each season. Rates use U.S. population denominators and are adjusted to account for RSV underdetection because of testing practices and test sensitivity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;¶&lt;/sup&gt; Z-tests (RSV-NET) or &lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-tests (NVSN) were used to assess whether rate ratios differed from 1, with p&amp;lt;0.05 considered statistically significant.&lt;br&gt;
** RRR was estimated as (1 – rate ratio) x 100%.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; RRR 95% CIs that excluded 0 were considered statistically significant, corresponding to rate ratio 95% CIs excluding 1 and p&amp;lt;0.05.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;§§&lt;/sup&gt; NVSN conducts active, population-based surveillance for acute respiratory illness among hospitalized children aged &amp;lt;18 years at seven U.S. medical centers. NVSN population-based RSV-associated hospitalization rates were generated using actively enrolled residents of defined catchment-area counties for the seven sites that were included: Cincinnati (Hamilton County, Ohio); Houston (Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller counties, Texas); Kansas City (Jackson County, Missouri); Nashville (Davidson County, Tennessee); Pittsburgh (Allegheny County, Pennsylvania); Rochester (Monroe County, New York); and Seattle (King County, Washington).&lt;/p&gt;

Also referred to as time-restricted eating, intermittent fasting restricts when you eat—or don't—to a time period, which could be hours or a day. While previous research has shown potential benefits of the diet to lower blood pressure or help with weight loss, new research is saying otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the research presented at the &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/8-hour-time-restricted-eating-linked-to-a-91-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-death" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Heart Association's scientific sessions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Heart Association's scientific sessions&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago claimed that intermittent fasting can drastically increase the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research from Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine in China, restricting food consumption to less than eight hours per day increases the chances of cardiovascular death by a whopping 91 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the analysis has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in an academic journal, the data was collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers reviewed responses from 20,000 adults on what they ate for at least two days. They then examined which of those participants died of cardiovascular disease after around eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, co-author of the analysis, Victor Wenze Zhong, says that it still might be too early to take this information as a conclusion based on his research alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Practicing intermittent fasting for a short period such as three months may likely lead to benefits on reducing weight and improving cardiometabolic health," Zhong told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/intermittent-fasting-risk-cardiovascular-death-rcna143853" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NBC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt; in an email. He added that people "should be extremely cautious" when practicing intermittent fasting for a longer amount of time, like years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhong added that he is unclear as to why there is an association between intermittent fasting and the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. He did say, however, that those who limit their eating to fewer than eight hours per day have a lower lean muscle mass than those that consume food for 12 to 16 hours—and low lean muscle mass is linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A research professor at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City, Dr. Benjamin Horne, also noted that fasting increases stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can also increase the risk of heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 16:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPZ240eEt1NklNNlhzaF90UUU5RHZJcVJzUHdKblFrTVBYY0d4bW5QUGRNYWVVeFRBcTBCYkE0alZWazhTeXlrVWQ4T0xiN2xMd3R3WGVJNTJxYl9IWU51MklTY1ZSYXBzR3lLM2hxSW5jYmhSZ0o5NnRndnpOWU43QVJ3</guid></item><item><title>医生说这种廉价药物可能是预防结肠癌的“游戏规则改变者” - bestlifeonline.com | Doctors Say This Cheap Drug May Be a "Game Changer" for Preventing Colon Cancer - bestlifeonline.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBaS2xMWU9CM1c2a0hMME5SU2FONEwtSGxMSm1MaHFRSk93QV8tbWlpSGJFeldhQ05yajVnSl9sYXFab0ZsTG5IUDFuNHIxV1NzSFNVaDJGWDFvTjdUeG53?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-modal-body" id="sTop_Bar_0_0_23_0_0_13_1"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 86 65" fill="none"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_10068_937)"&gt;&lt;path d="M83.0003 61.8788V2.99927H3.00058V61.8788H83.0003Z" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M3.74396 3.74927L38.2558 38.7207C40.8139 41.2985 45.4686 41.268 47.9726 38.7442L82.4608 4.03073" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M4.92966 59.9398L31.3724 32.9077" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M80.7678 59.6279L55.038 33.2822" stroke="#E8021D" stroke-width="6.00023"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_10068_937"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;h3 class="newsletter-modal__headline"&gt;Best Life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="text-medium"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is especially dangerous for young children, with the CDC saying one in 20 develop pneumonia while one in 1,000 develop encephalitis — swelling on the brain that can cause permanent damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One to three in every 1,000 unvaccinated children who are infected die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DailyMail.com analyzed measles cases reported by local health departments to reveal an overall cases figure for the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC does publish a tally on nationwide measles infections, but this is only updated every Friday and no longer provides a specific number of cases per state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its figures also often miss the most recent cases reported by local health departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Texas had the most measles infections at 718 — including 702 linked to the outbreak and 16 linked to other outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New Mexico's tally is the second highest, at 71 cases, followed by Kansas, at 49 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Measles is the most infectious disease known to man and particularly dangerous for young children, officials say (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and California have each reported more than ten cases so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the other end of the scale were Alaska, Florida, Virginia, Vermont and Rhode Island which have each reported one measles case so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The only other time measles cases exceeded 1,000 since 2000 was in 2019, when 1,274 cases were reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That outbreak was concentrated in the Orthodox Jewish community in New York, where vaccination rates were lower. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says about 13 percent of confirmed cases have resulted in hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US achieved its measles elimination status in 2000 after having 12 months where no 'endemic' measles cases were recorded — or no cases where someone became infected with measles without leaving the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That is now under threat, however, with officials saying that if there is continuous transmission of measles in the US for a year or more the country will no longer be considered to have eliminated the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Peter Marks, a former FDA director, warned &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/ousted-fda-vaccine-chief-us-measles-elimination-status-threat-rcna199966"&gt;NBC News &lt;/a&gt;previously: 'I think we're well on our way [to losing measles elimination status].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows weekly measles cases by rash onset date according to the CDC &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;And this shows the tally of measles cases by year.

A study published in the&lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00072-8/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Journal of Preventive Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; showed &lt;strong&gt;that every 10% increase in total calories from ultra-processed foods raises the risk of early death by 3%&lt;/strong&gt;. Keep reading to find out how you can better protect your health with the food you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What exactly is a processed food?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you dig into the details of the new study, it's helpful to know that just because food is in plastic doesn't mean it's processed, and the levels of processing vary. The studies in this research categorized food according to the &lt;a href="https://archive.wphna.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WN-2016-7-1-3-28-38-Monteiro-Cannon-Levy-et-al-NOVA.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NOVA food classification system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NOVA food classification system&lt;/a&gt;. Here's an overview of the guidelines they used:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimally processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; start as unprocessed foods and undergo treatment, such as freezing, drying, or pasteurization to boost safety or shelf life. No ingredients are added. &lt;strong&gt;Examples: &lt;/strong&gt;frozen vegetables, parboiled rice, pasteurized milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed culinary ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; are made from nature or unprocessed or minimally processed foods using methods such as grinding or refining. &lt;strong&gt;Examples:&lt;/strong&gt; salt, sugar, honey, vegetable oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; contain a few unprocessed or minimally processed foods plus processed culinary ingredients. They might also have tiny amounts of antioxidants, stabilizers or preservatives for freshness. &lt;strong&gt;Examples:&lt;/strong&gt; fruit canned with sugar, salted nuts, cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt; usually have five or more — typically many more — ingredients, such as food dyes, flavor enhancers, non-sugar sweeteners and other additives for texture. &lt;strong&gt;Examples: &lt;/strong&gt;soda, ice cream, energy drinks, frozen pizza, sausage, hot dogs, powdered soups, mass-produced baked goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did this study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from seven studies connecting ultra-processed foods with premature death. The studies all defined ultra-processed foods in the same way detailed above. &lt;strong&gt;The data showed that every 10% increase in calories from heavily industrialized foods resulted in a 3% increase in premature death risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This figure is impressive yet not unexpected, because other recent studies found impacts of the same magnitude,” says study author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-nilson-176b8a1b/?originalSubdomain=br" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eduardo Nilson, D.Sc.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Eduardo Nilson, D.Sc.&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the Epidemiological Research Center in Nutrition and Health – Nupens at the University of São Paulo in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in this study, the risk of premature death climbed as people consumed more ultra-processed food. So, for example, &lt;strong&gt;going from a diet of 10% ultra-processed food to 20% doubled risk, Nilson explains.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, researchers estimated the contribution of ultra-processed foods to premature mortality in eight countries. The U.S. and U.K. tied for the top spot, with 14% of premature deaths linked to ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The difference between countries with lower (yet increasing) consumption of ultra-processed foods and those with higher consumption shows that large impacts on preventable deaths could be potentially achieved by reducing ultra-processed food consumption,” says Nilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are ultra-processed foods linked to early death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One explanation: High intake of heavily processed food is associated with cardiovascular disease, the top cause of death, but Nilson says other conditions are likely part of the equation, too. “Potential health effects of ultra-processed foods might be mediated through weight gain, high cholesterol, gut microbiome changes, inflammation, blood sugar spikes, insulin resistance and high blood pressure,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why might these foods have so many unsavory effects? For starters, ultra-processed foods are often high in sodium, fat, sugar and calories, all of which can contribute to cardiometabolic diseases. But that might not be all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Processing drastically changes the structure of food, meaning ultra-processed foods might affect the body differently than unprocessed foods, even if they have similar nutrients,” he says. “For example, their broken-down texture could alter how quickly they’re digested, how full they make you feel, blood sugar levels and even gut bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about an apple versus a product with apple juice concentrate — like a sweet syrup. You absorb the sugar in the apple slowly thanks to natural components like fiber. You absorb the fructose in juice fast, says Nilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another problem? Highly processed foods are easy to eat, which leaves less room for more nutritious choices. They're often ready-to-eat and ready-to-heat meals, snacks and beverages that are manufactured to be more convenient and flavorful, so they end up taking the place of fresh and minimally processed foods in a person's diet, explains Nilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to eat fewer ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra-processed food consumption is a global public health issue, according to the researchers. Public policies, they say, should incentivize us to eat fresh and minimally processed foods. In the meantime, Nilson recommends shopping for local, seasonal items as much as possible — perfect timing as farmer’s market season ramps up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the best way to reduce your intake of ultra-processed foods is to start with small changes, says &lt;a href="https://www.vitalrd.com/about" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jessica Crandall, R.D.N., C.D.C.E.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jessica Crandall, R.D.N., C.D.C.E.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and medical advisor at FuturHealth. “You do not have to change your whole diet and lifestyle overnight — in fact, I actually recommend &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;doing that,” says Crandall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swap out a highly processed snack you normally would eat for fruit with plain yogurt or vegetables with hummus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meal prep overnight oats so they’re ready in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock your pantry and fridge with minimally processed staples — like beans, frozen vegetables, whole grains and plain yogurt — so it’s easier to prepare healthy meals even on busy days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I encourage an 80/20 approach: if 80% of your food intake comes from whole or minimally processed sources, the other 20% can include convenience foods or occasional treats,” says Crandall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 15:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5iUnoxQWpTM2diMnRyMC1uajAzMUR2Sk5aOXFtRng3ZnJHY3dzTGViR1RsTGJ1VFF5QXMzR1lqNlI3LUxTWmpNRVVqUmlfZDg3S0UxeUhzS3o1WlJEXzBvenk1aVhJeUppTHhDWE9ERnF2VF9Vd0xlM3F4S0w</guid></item><item><title>大脑中的触发预测错误是如何令人惊讶的-神经科学新闻 | How Surprises Trigger Prediction Errors in the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1Qa3BWcW5KX19CakRsRlA3ODd5cEZZdjhHRlhYRlRKWm04d0xTaktYV2EyNmNzckY5SGU1aW0wdGpDbnBnazlzdHFrR0FKaGhHV2Z6OEtVbzdtY25KMmJ4N1RVT25VZVBzM19NQzQzV2IySFpCZTB2bnU2c1E1LXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE1Qa3BWcW5KX19CakRsRlA3ODd5cEZZdjhHRlhYRlRKWm04d0xTaktYV2EyNmNzckY5SGU1aW0wdGpDbnBnazlzdHFrR0FKaGhHV2Z6OEtVbzdtY25KMmJ4N1RVT25VZVBzM19NQzQzV2IySFpCZTB2bnU2c1E1LXc?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;How Surprises Trigger Prediction Errors in the Brain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 15:38:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1Qa3BWcW5KX19CakRsRlA3ODd5cEZZdjhHRlhYRlRKWm04d0xTaktYV2EyNmNzckY5SGU1aW0wdGpDbnBnazlzdHFrR0FKaGhHV2Z6OEtVbzdtY25KMmJ4N1RVT25VZVBzM19NQzQzV2IySFpCZTB2bnU2c1E1LXc</guid></item><item><title>我们是不是都想错了ADHD ？ - think.kera.org | Have We Been Thinking About A.D.H.D.

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Harvard University are proposing a fundamental change in the way we consider psychedelics and their therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mouse models and human cells, the team of neuroscientists has demonstrated that hallucinogens hold the potential to reshape communication between brain cells and the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study underscores how psychedelics can do more than just change perception; they can help dial down inflammation and reset brain-immune interactions," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/psychedelics-can-reverse-neuroimmune-interactions-that-boost-fear"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; neuroimmunologist Michael Wheeler from Harvard and Brigham and Women's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This could reshape how we think about treatment for inflammatory disorders and conditions like anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="160321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03032-x"&gt;Emerging research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that inflammation in the brain may increase the risk of major psychiatric disorders, and specific cells called astrocytes play a key role in that immune response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK545142/"&gt;most common cell&lt;/a&gt; in the central nervous system, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-receptors-for-cannabis-could-be-why-some-people-are-more-resilient"&gt;recent studies on mice&lt;/a&gt; suggest that when these neural entities experience strong and prolonged activation, it can increase inflammation in the brain and lead to anxiety and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much is still unknown about psychedelics and the impact they have on human health, some &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2022.109232"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that hallucinogens like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lsd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73096" data-postid="160321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;LSD&lt;/a&gt; are potent anti-inflammatory agents, which can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.08.049"&gt;regulate astrocyte activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore that idea further, Wheeler and his colleagues turned to mice that had experienced short-term stress for 7 days and chronic stress for 18 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using genome analysis and behavioral tests, the team found that mouse brains exposed to small bouts of stress are generally resilient. In mice experiencing stress for seven days, astrocytes in the brain's amygdala – crucial for emotional control – were linked to fewer stress-induced fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resilience was linked to the expression of a specific receptor on astrocytes, called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), which seems to reduce 'crosstalk' between neurons and immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160342" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Schematic-representation-of-microglia-astrocyte-crosstalk-during-neuroinflammation-and-642x318.png" alt="Astrocyte Cross-Talk" class="size-medium wp-image-160342" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Schematic-representation-of-microglia-astrocyte-crosstalk-during-neuroinflammation-and-642x318.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Schematic-representation-of-microglia-astrocyte-crosstalk-during-neuroinflammation-and-838x415.png 838w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Schematic-representation-of-microglia-astrocyte-crosstalk-during-neuroinflammation-and-768x380.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Schematic-representation-of-microglia-astrocyte-crosstalk-during-neuroinflammation-and-600x297.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/Schematic-representation-of-microglia-astrocyte-crosstalk-during-neuroinflammation-and.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160342" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cross-talk between astrocytes and brain cells that trigger inflammatory immune responses. (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23052646"&gt;Puebla et al., &lt;em&gt;Int. J. Mol. Sci&lt;/em&gt;., 2022&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a mouse experienced chronic and overwhelming stress for 18 days, however, their EGFR expression was reduced, and this triggered a cascade of inflammatory responses and fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is fascinating is that psychedelic compounds can reverse this entire process," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1082048"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he and his colleagues administered  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-magic-mushrooms" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73114" data-postid="160321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;psilocybin&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mdma" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73038" data-postid="160321" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MDMA&lt;/a&gt; to mice with poor EGFR function, they found a reduction in inflammatory cells surrounding the brain and reduced fear behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore whether the same effect is possible in our own species, the team turned to human cells. Not only did the Harvard researchers find similar signals of stress in our own brain cells, they also analyzed human gene expression data from people with major depressive disorder and found altered EGFR signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments are needed to explore how psychedelics impact EGFR expression and what this does to inflammation in the brain, but the evidence that psychedelics can reshape immune responses in the central nervous system is compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is tied to a whole host of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01486-5"&gt;neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2023.09.004"&gt;mood disorders&lt;/a&gt;, and these findings highlight "potential direct and indirect mechanisms by which psychedelics influence physiological responses to chronic stress and neuroimmune interactions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're not saying that psychedelics are a cure-all for inflammatory diseases or any other health condition," &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/psychedelics-can-reverse-neuroimmune-interactions-that-boost-fear"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"But we do see evidence that psychedelics have some tissue-specific benefits and that learning more about them could open up entirely new possibilities for treatments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08880-9"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s something half the population will experience, yet it’s been historically under-discussed. In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37738034/#:~:text=Only%2031.3%25%20reported%20having%20a,high%20volume%20of%20menopausal%20patients." target="_blank"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found that only 31% of doctors received menopause training in medical school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Because of that, many women aren’t familiar with the stage that comes &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; menopause: perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Perimenopause is when hormone levels — especially estrogen and progesterone — begin to fluctuate in the years leading up to menopause. And with that shift can come a host of confusing, sometimes disruptive symptoms, from hot flashes and night sweats to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/menopause-skin-care-rcna198880" target="_blank"&gt;skin changes&lt;/a&gt; and mood swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Below, doctors explain what perimenopause is, how to tell if you’re in it, and what you can do to ease the transition. Plus, we share expert-recommended products that may help with common symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/what-is-perimenopause-rcna205592#anchor-b869d3" id="anchor-b869d3" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What is perimenopause?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Perimenopause refers to the transitional phase before menopause, according to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4834516/" target="_blank"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. It’s marked by shifting reproductive hormone levels — especially estrogen and progesterone — and typically starts in a woman’s 30s to 50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s no single test that confirms perimenopause, since hormone levels naturally fluctuate throughout the month. Instead, doctors assess your age, symptoms, and family history to make a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/what-is-perimenopause-rcna205592#anchor-5871be" id="anchor-5871be" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Symptoms of perimenopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Perimenopause looks different for everyone — some experience intense symptoms, while others have a more gradual transition. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44294-025-00061-3" target="_blank"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; it begins about 5 to 10 years before menopause. Common symptoms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot flashes and night sweats:&lt;/strong&gt; Caused by hormonal shifts affecting the hypothalamus, your body’s temperature regulator.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Irregular periods, vaginal dryness, and low libido:&lt;/strong&gt; Estrogen and progesterone imbalances can impact the menstrual cycle and sexual health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin and hair changes:&lt;/strong&gt; Lower estrogen levels reduce collagen and moisture, leading to dryness, thinning skin, and increased hair shedding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mood swings and brain fog:&lt;/strong&gt; Hormonal fluctuations can mimic the emotional volatility of adolescence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep issues, weight gain, joint pain, and frequent urination&lt;/strong&gt; are also commonly reported.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/what-is-perimenopause-rcna205592#anchor-9f6adf" id="anchor-9f6adf" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What can you do about perimenopause symptoms? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;You don’t have to tough it out — there are actionable ways to ease symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing you can do is approach aging with intention,” says Dr. Cristina Del Toro Badessa, a board-certified physician in &lt;a href="https://www.artisanbeaute.com/" target="_blank"&gt;integrative medicine&lt;/a&gt;. That includes eating well, exercising, limiting alcohol and caffeine, managing stress, and prioritizing sleep and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some women benefit from supplements like &lt;strong&gt;collagen peptides or biotin&lt;/strong&gt;, which may support skin and hair health. Others explore &lt;strong&gt;hormone replacement therapy (HRT)&lt;/strong&gt;, though it’s best discussed with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are also targeted products that can provide comfort and relief for specific symptoms — a few of our expert-approved picks are below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/what-is-perimenopause-rcna205592#anchor-351e44" id="anchor-351e44" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Our top picks for perimenopause symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While over-the-counter products are unlikely to eradicate symptoms, several things can make them feel more manageable.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vitamin supplement that improves metabolism in the eye appears to slow down damage to the optic nerve in glaucoma. The promising results have been &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(25)00200-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. The researchers behind the study have now started a clinical trial on patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/glaucoma/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;glaucoma&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/optic+nerve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;optic nerve&lt;/a&gt; is gradually damaged, leading to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vision+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vision loss&lt;/a&gt; and, in the worst cases, blindness. High pressure in the eye drives the disease, and eye drops, laser treatment or surgery are therefore used to lower the pressure in the eye and thus slow down the disease. Unfortunately, however, the effect varies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma researchers have long theorized that the substance homocysteine is somehow relevant to understanding the disease. Now, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have investigated the role of homocysteine in several ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers discovered that when rats with glaucoma were given elevated levels of homocysteine, their disease did not worsen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that high levels of homocysteine in the blood of people with glaucoma did not correlate with how quickly the disease progressed, and that glaucoma was not more common in people with a genetic susceptibility to forming high levels of homocysteine. Based on these findings, the researchers concluded that homocysteine does not drive the disease but is a consequence of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since homocysteine is a natural part of the body's metabolism, the researchers wanted to investigate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+pathways/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic pathways&lt;/a&gt; involving homocysteine in both rodents and humans with glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;They then saw several abnormalities, the most important of which were &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+changes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic changes&lt;/a&gt; linked to the retina's ability to use certain vitamins. This change meant that metabolism was slowed down locally in the retina—and this played a role in the development of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our conclusion is that homocysteine is a bystander in the disease process, not a player. Altered &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/homocysteine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;homocysteine&lt;/a&gt; levels may reveal that the retina has lost its ability to use certain vitamins that are necessary to maintain healthy metabolism. That's why we wanted to investigate whether supplements of these vitamins could protect the retina," says co-lead on the paper James Tribble, researcher and assistant professor at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience at Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments on mice and rats with glaucoma, the researchers gave supplements of the B vitamins B6, B9 and B12, as well as choline. This had a positive effect. In mice that had slower-developing glaucoma, the damage to the optic nerve was completely halted. In rats, which had a more aggressive form of the disease with faster progression, the disease was slowed down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these experiments, eye pressure was left untreated, which the researchers highlight as particularly interesting—it suggests that the vitamin mix affects the disease in a different way than lowering eye pressure does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results are so promising that we have started a clinical trial, with patients already being recruited at St. Erik Eye Hospital in Stockholm," says James Tribble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (slower progression) and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma (faster progression) are included.&lt;/p&gt;
