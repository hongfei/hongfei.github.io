        &lt;p&gt;It turns out that your annoying friend who insists on closing all of the window blinds and covering all of the glowing electronics in a bedroom in order to sleep in total darkness is onto something. New research bolsters the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/study-sleeping-even-small-amount-light-could-harm-heart-health"&gt;well-established&lt;/a&gt; theory linking nighttime light to adverse health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A preliminary analysis set to be presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2025, starting Friday, suggests that the state of darkness while we sleep plays a crucial role in our overall health. The results link more artificial light at night, also known as artificial nighttime light pollution, with higher brain stress signals, inflamed blood vessels, and greater risk of &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseases.html"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;—a broad term for different heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We know that environmental factors, such as air and noise pollution, can lead to heart disease by affecting our nerves and blood vessels through stress. Light pollution is very common; however, we don’t know much about how it affects the heart,” Shady Abohashem, head of cardiac PET/CT imaging trials at Massachusetts General Hospital and senior author of the yet-unpublished study, said in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk?preview=d465&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Artificial nighttime brightness at home&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the observational study, Abohashem and his colleagues reviewed the health data of 466 adults who had undergone the same combined Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scan at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston between 2005 and 2008 to identify stress signals in the brain and evidence of artery inflammation. They also investigated the adults’ exposure to artificial nighttime brightness at their homes via the 2016 New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who experienced greater amounts of nighttime artificial light had higher brain stress activity, blood vessel inflammation, and a greater chance of developing heart disease. Unsurprisingly, the risk of heart issues was increased among participants who lived in areas with additional stress factors like significant traffic noise or lower neighborhood income. By the end of 2018, 17% of the adults had experienced significant heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We found a nearly linear relationship between nighttime light and heart disease: the more night-light exposure, the higher the risk. Even modest increases in night-time light were linked with higher brain and artery stress,” Abohashem explained. The correlation remained even after researchers adjusted for known heart risk factors and other socio-environmental stresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When the brain perceives stress, it activates signals that can trigger an immune response and inflame the blood vessels,” he added. “Over time, this process can contribute to hardening of the arteries and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Put the phone down&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what can we do about it? Cities could diminish unnecessary external lighting, and individuals could lessen indoor nighttime light before going to bed, according to Abohashem. That includes screens, which means no more scrolling on TikTok before snoozing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We know too much exposure to artificial light at night can harm your health, particularly increasing the risk of heart disease. However, we did not know how this harm happened,” said Julio Fernandez-Mendoza, who is director of behavioral sleep medicine at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and was not involved in the study. “This study has investigated one of several possible causes, which is how our brains respond to stress. This response seems to play a big role in linking artificial light at night to heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, the study has some limitations, according to the statement. For example, the participants were drawn from a single hospital system, so the group may lack diversity, and the results might not reflect the broader population. Furthermore, because of the nature of an observational study, it can’t prove that the associations are causal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want to expand this work in larger, more diverse populations, test interventions that reduce nighttime light, and explore how reducing light exposure might improve heart health,” Abohashem concluded.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

The findings were published last week in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt; (AHA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is well recognized that human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, and other viruses can cause cancer; however, the link between viral infections and other non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, is less well understood," lead author Kosuke Kawai, ScD, of UCLA, said in an AHA &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1103173"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stroke 5 times more likely after flu&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 155 studies, published from 1997 to July 2024, were primarily conducted in North America, Europe, and East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self‐controlled case series studies tied flu to a fourfold elevated risk of heart attack (pooled incidence rate ratio [IRR], 4.01) and a fivefold higher risk of stroke during the first 1 month (IRR, 5.01), and cohort studies suggested a higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) with hepatitis C infection (RR, 1.27) and stroke (RR, 1.23). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV was consistently linked to a higher risk of CHD (pooled adjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.60) and stroke (RR, 1.45), as was SARS‐CoV‐2 (CHD RR, 1.74; stroke RR, 1.69). Likewise, shingles was associated with a greater risk of CHD (RR, 1.12) and stroke (RR, 1.18). Evidence of an effect of cytomegalovirus, which can cause birth defects, on cardiovascular disease was insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors noted that viral infections trigger the immune system to release substances that lead to inflammation and increase the risk of blood clots, processes that may persist long after initial infection and raise the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The elevated risks for cardiovascular disease risks are lower for HIV, hepatitis C and herpes zoster than the heightened short-term risk following influenza and COVID," Kawai said. "However, the risks associated with those three viruses are still clinically relevant, especially because they persist for a long period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to shingles, which affects roughly one in three people in their lifetime, "the elevated risk associated with that virus translates into a large number of excess cases of cardiovascular disease at the population level," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccines' role in preventing heart, vascular disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study highlights the importance of integrated preventive measures, especially for adults with traditional risk factors for CVD [cardiovascular disease]," the researchers concluded. "Vaccines may play an important role in preventing the risk of CVD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2020, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by researchers from UCLA and Vanderbilt University reviewed hospital admissions, interventions, and outcomes for early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diverticulitis is commonly found in those over 50 years old and is caused by the inflammation or infection of pouches called diverticula. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pouches form in the wall of the colon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When irritated, people may experience abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel movements. &lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Extreme cases could lead to perforation or bowel obstruction, which would require surgery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with diverticulitis tend to be diagnosed between the ages of 52 and 64; however, studies show that this age range is changing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reviewing 5.2 million hospitalizations in the National Inpatient Sample, researchers found that the proportion of patients under the age of 50 being admitted with diverticulitis complications increased form 18.5 percent to 28.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that the reason for the drastic increase still remains unclear, however, &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/10531604/dangers-favourite-foods-cancer-lung-issue-death/"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; in younger people have a massive impact on diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In 2012, a study estimated that about 40 to 53 percent of cases were inheritable, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15253749/young-people-increased-disease-colon-diverticulitis.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, a 2025 study found that those who may be genetically predisposed to the complication &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/13195259/magic-numbers-reveal-just-how-healthy-you-are/"&gt;but had a low BMI&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t smoke, and ate nutritious foods were less likely to have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;Younger patients with early-onset diverticulitis were found to have lower mortality rates and shorter hospital stays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conversely, younger patients were more likely to need invasive interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early-onset patients are 29 percent more likely to need a colectomy, which removes part or all of the colon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They are also 58 percent more likely to need the area to be drained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they’re paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions,” Lead author and fourth-year medical student at UCLA Shineui Kim wrote in the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kim noted that more research needs to urgently be conducted to investigate the cause of the rise in early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of cancer death in the U.S., despite a dramatic decline in smoking, a new American Cancer Society report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cancer/lung-cancer-2665626923.html" target="_blank"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; deaths are linked to tobacco, data from the inaugural release of the American Heart Association's &lt;a href="https://ustobaccoatlas.cancer.org/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Tobacco Atlas&lt;/a&gt; states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's even though cigarette smoking among adults cratered from 42% in 1965 to just 11% in 2023, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quit rates also have skyrocketed, with a record 62% of smokers trying to &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/drug-center-wl/what-are-quit-smoking-programs-and-how-can-they-help-you" target="_blank"&gt;drop the habit&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, the reports says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, smokers are shunning the low-dose CT chest scans that are recommended for lung cancer screening, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 18% of eligible current or former smokers were up to date with screening in 2022 -- such screening can catch cancers early and improve survival odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The &lt;a href="https://tobaccoatlas.org/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Tobacco Atlas&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful tool showcasing not only the toll that tobacco has taken on the U.S., but also the immense progress public health gains have made over the past decades," lead report editor &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/nigar-nargis-bio.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nigar Nargis&lt;/a&gt;, senior scientific director of tobacco control research at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since the landmark 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on tobacco, millions of lives have been saved by tobacco control, but the scale of the epidemic demands our continued attention and support," Nargis added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACS recommends annual lung cancer screening for adults 50 to 80 who smoke or used to smoke and have a 20-year or greater pack-year smoking history. A pack year is equal to smoking one pack per day for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new atlas maps U.S. tobacco use and control efforts at national and state levels, the ACS said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the report found that lung cancer screening rates are lowest in Southern States, where the burden of lung cancer is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of tobacco cessation aids also remains lowest in the South and Midwest, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. Tobacco Atlas is more than a report - it is a call to action. It reminds us that progress is possible, but not inevitable. It requires bold leadership, equitable policies, and unwavering commitment from every sector of society," &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/executive-leadership/william-dahut-bio.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Dahut&lt;/a&gt;, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other findings include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 33% of people who use tobacco also use e-cigarettes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1.6 million youth use e-cigarettes, with 90% preferring flavored products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racial minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those with lower income and limited education face higher tobacco-related burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we have made significant strides in reducing smoking prevalence and expanding access to evidence-based cessation resources, we remain deeply concerned about persistent disparities in tobacco use and tobacco-related disease," senior author &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/ahmedin-jemal-bio.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ahmedin Jemal&lt;/a&gt;, senior scientific vice president of surveillance, prevention and health service research at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These disparities are particularly pronounced in states with weak tobacco control policies and among populations with lower socioeconomic status, and within communities historically targeted by the tobacco industry," Jemal said. "This report brings these inequities into sharp focus and underscores the urgent need for strengthening state and federal tobacco control policies, as well as targeted interventions."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/php/data-statistics/adult-data-cigarettes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cigarette smoking among U.S. adults&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We know when cold and allergy meds will fly off the shelves. So why not seasonal depression? For the fourth year, &lt;a href="https://www.thriveworks.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thriveworks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thriveworks&lt;/a&gt; has analyzed Google search trends and weather data to pinpoint when seasonal depression hits hardest, giving people a chance to get ahead of it with preventative care or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the pattern is holding: Seasonal depression is expected to peak in the third week of November. That’s when searches for seasonal depression historically spike. And true to form, search interest already climbed 125% from mid-August to late September (Aug. 10-Sept. 28)—the typical seasonal ramp-up as days get shorter and temperatures drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Is Seasonal Depression?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the research, let’s clarify what seasonal depression means. Officially, it’s called &lt;a href="https://thriveworks.com/help-with/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seasonal affective disorder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt; (SAD), and it’s a type of depression that follows a seasonal pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seasonal depression describes episodes of major depressive disorder that occur at a specific time of year—most commonly fall and winter,” explains Laura Harris, a licensed clinical mental health counselor at Thriveworks. “The key characteristic is that symptoms appear during a particular season and then resolve when that season ends.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Common Symptoms to Watch For&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of seasonal depression match those of other types of depression. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet the diagnostic criteria for seasonal depression, symptoms must resolve at the end of the seasonal period. For example, someone might develop symptoms at the beginning of fall and then see them conclude at the start of spring. They must also experience this seasonal depressive pattern for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When Does Seasonal Depression Peak?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to understand exactly when seasonal depression might reach its peak this year to better help those who suffer from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By knowing how seasonal triggers affect you and when they typically hit, you can plan ahead,” says Heidi Faust, a licensed clinical social worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy? Get more done during your good months, and set yourself up for success during the hard ones. “This might mean scheduling important appointments with reminders during the fall and winter months—things like annual checkups or therapy sessions,” Faust explains. “You can also build in activities that help counter seasonal depression, like regular social plans or outdoor time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google search data for “seasonal depression” over the last five years (U.S. searches only) was analyzed to predict this year’s peak. The pattern is consistent: Searches spike in mid-November, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Line graph showing Google search interest for seasonal depression from 2018-2025, with annual peaks in November ranging from 48 to 100, and 2025 projected peak of 77 on November 16. - Thriveworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Seasonal Depression Getting Worse?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a comparison of the eight-week time period from Aug. 10 to Sept. 28 for “seasonal depression” search data for the last six years to gain insights into this year’s peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past six years, there has been steady growth in search interest for the term “seasonal depression,” indicative of expanded awareness of the affliction. Between the years of 2019 and 2025, search interest for this topic has grown at an average annual rate of 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comparison of the eight-week buildup period revealed that search interest in seasonal depression followed its typical seasonal pattern, increasing 125% from mid-August to late September as fall approached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Bar chart showing annual average Google search interest for seasonal depression from 2019-2025, demonstrating steady growth from 31.6 to 32.6, with a peak of 36.6 in 2023. - Thriveworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Connection Between Temperature Drops and Seasonal Depression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s Google Trends analysis also showed where search interest for “seasonal depression” was the highest over the last five years. The top 10 metros are geographically diverse but share a common thread: dramatic temperature shifts in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The 10 U.S. Cities Where Seasonal Depression Hits Hardest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho Falls, Idaho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrisonburg, Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springfield, Massachusetts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syracuse, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missoula, Montana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ottumwa, Iowa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowling Green, Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binghamton, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utica, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then looked at weather data, including average monthly temperatures, for these 10 metros. The team discovered that throughout the months of September, October, November, and December—when seasonal depression tends to peak—these top 10 cities experience an average temperature drop of 27.95 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Bar chart comparing average high and low temperatures from September through December for the top 10 cities with highest seasonal depression search interest, showing an average temperature drop of 27.95 degrees. - Thriveworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;This aligns with the Google Trends research, showing that search interest peaks between October and November with consistently high search volume through mid-December. The data suggests that rapid seasonal changes—both temperature drops and&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decreasing daylight hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; decreasing daylight hours&lt;/a&gt;—drive the spike. Most of these top 10 cities are in the northern U.S., where fall brings both dramatic temperature shifts and significant daylight loss, which together contribute to seasonal depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Actually Helps With Seasonal Depression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Hanselman, a board-certified psychiatric nurse practitioner at Thriveworks, recommends a few actions that can help you manage symptoms of depression during seasonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start With Environmental Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20364651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:light therapy box;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;light therapy box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; first thing in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for 20-30 minutes of light exposure within the first hour of waking up. Position the lightbox at eye level, about 16-24 inches from your face, while you have breakfast or check email. Morning light exposure helps reset your circadian rhythm and supports serotonin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get outside before noon, even on cloudy days.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/seasonal-affective-disorder-bring-on-the-light" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natural daylight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natural daylight&lt;/a&gt;—even through clouds—is significantly brighter than indoor lighting and helps regulate melatonin production. A 15-minute morning walk exposes you to light that indoor environments simply can’t replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Build Daily Habits That Protect Your Mood&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wake up at the same time every day—yes, even weekends.&lt;/strong&gt; Your &lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:circadian rhythm controls serotonin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;circadian rhythm controls serotonin production&lt;/a&gt;, and inconsistent wake times disrupt this system. A stable wake time naturally regulates your sleep-wake cycle within &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two to three weeks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;two to three weeks&lt;/a&gt;, even if your bedtime varies. Rising at the same time every day can naturally stabilize a variable bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body in ways that feel good.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s a YouTube yoga class, a walk with the dogs, joining a fitness class, or taking the stairs, it all counts. Physical activity supports mood regulation, but the key is consistency over intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with people daily, even in small ways.&lt;/strong&gt; Seasonal depression often comes with the urge to isolate, which can worsen symptoms. Daily social contact—whether it’s dinner with family, helping a neighbor, or simply a text to friends—helps counter the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/social-isolation-loneliness-older-adults-pose-health-risks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:loneliness-depression cycle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;loneliness-depression cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol and other substances.&lt;/strong&gt; While it can be tempting to think that a drink or two will ease your distress, substance use typically &lt;a href="https://journals.healio.com/doi/10.3928/00485713-20240913-03" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worsens existing depression symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;worsens existing depression symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. If you use substances regularly, check with a professional before stopping on your own to make sure you have the support you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When Symptoms Hit, Use These Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get it down on paper.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://thriveworks.com/blog/journaling-is-the-ultimate-self-help-tool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journaling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journaling&lt;/a&gt; helps you externalize what’s happening internally, making patterns more visible and feelings more manageable. Planning out your week on a calendar and scheduling at least one enjoyable activity daily can also help reduce overwhelm and increase joy. And if you’re overwhelmed by tasks, try writing a to-do list and crossing off one to two things daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a coping tools box.&lt;/strong&gt; Fill it with things that help ground you: photos of happy times, a favorite playlist, a list of grounding techniques, a plan for gentle movement, or a coloring book. Having these tools ready makes them easier to reach for when you need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to See a Therapist for Seasonal Depression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to practicing the above strategies, it’s important to seek professional help. “Come see us,” says Hanselman. “Meet with a mental health provider to discuss what options are available to make your symptoms more manageable, whether that’s medication, therapy, or a combination of both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy is an evidence-based approach to treating depression. Within this modality, clients are taught to identify and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. The role of the therapist is to teach skills that help positively align the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing symptoms of seasonal depression, please reach out for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thriveworks.com/help-with/research/seasonal-depression-peak/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thriveworks.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thriveworks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thriveworks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 18:18:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9zMXhvZC1LYjZwczAyaWZnR09GMzVBNzkzajJzNW5mY0VyUVRUalNZd0JIbGJHdXNCNHZCTEg3V2E3RHpDWXNUTzh4UUxoUlo0cFVhSmF3bWMteFZWZ3EzemkwTlFnb1poQnBiSnoyTDdvQ1IxUXlRQkJ1dw</guid></item><item><title>我减掉了一堆体重，喜欢我的样子。但是我什么时候脱衣服都认不出来。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/11/weight-loss-journey-advice-appearance.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp2os000o3b79gikeuv1x@published"&gt;Over the past year, I’ve purposefully lost a lot of weight. I did it mostly for health reasons (I was borderline diabetic, and have now reversed it, which is great), but I would be lying if there wasn’t some aesthetic desired mixed up in all of this as well. I love how I look now—except for one big problem.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjq0vvo000d3b79hy5aq81f@published"&gt;I have so much loose skin on my arms and my boobs! My boobs are completely deflated. So I like how I look in clothes but hate how I look naked—and am especially insecure now as I meet men for hookups and flings. I don’t think I need to warn them, but I feel like they must notice. I can’t help but think my body is a huge turnoff once the clothes come off. Where do I go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp2t8000q3b79vsyrsfx2@published"&gt;—Saggy Everywhere&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp2yp000s3b79dzj8mocw@published"&gt;Patience, combined with the kind of lifestyle that helps reduce the risk of diabetes, might help you more than you think. Your skin might become less loose over time (&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/loose-skin-after-weight-loss"&gt;putting on some muscle&lt;/a&gt; can help), and you may find you start to care less. If you’re still dissatisfied in another year, a dermatologist or plastic surgeon can offer you several options. But I suggest you give yourself some time to see what changes in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp30h000t3b796xjqfs5x@published"&gt;It’s important to know &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2500v087xo"&gt;that you aren’t alone&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure there’s something to be said for the power of knowing other people are having the same insecurities. But I bring this up to point out that because your experience isn’t super uncommon, the men you’re having flings with have probably encountered other naked women with similar skin. There absolutely are people in the world who will zero in on the physical details their partners are uncomfortable with, and some will even point those details out verbally, but those people are pretty rare. Anecdotally speaking, the men who are actually having a lot of hookups with multiple partners tend to be focused on the pleasure they’re experiencing and giving, or if anything, a bit concerned about their own characteristics they wish they could change. And, as strange as this may sound, straight men often appreciate or even fetishize certain appearance aspects that most women criticize about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="168" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp32g000u3b79e59kd72u@published"&gt;That said, I think it’s OK to lean on a band-aid style mitigation strategy, or at least have it as an option, and I’m an enthusiastic proponent of dressing for success. At all price points and in almost every imaginable aesthetic, there are bras that provide great support with sheer fabrics, bras that leave your nipples accessible, and bolero-style tops that cover only the shoulders and arms. Your best course of action will be to visit a few shops in person, as it’s infinitely more difficult to find the right fit for lingerie than it is for shirts or pants. If that’s not possible, lurking &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/16kygsb/good_bras_for_saggy_breasts_after_extensive/"&gt;the ABraThatFits subreddit&lt;/a&gt; can help you get an idea of what brands and styles might work for you, and the community is often happy to help posters who are willing to share their measurements. In the event that you get lucky and find a plethora of options that appeal to you, though, be choosy, as—to reiterate—your body might continue to change pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp34t000v3b798ielhdis@published"&gt;If you were looking for more of a long-term relationship, I’d be a bit more focused on encouraging you to look for people who feel supportive and accepting so you could be fully vulnerable with them. But hookup culture is accurately critiqued as being fairly superficial and usually too fast-paced for establishing that kind of trust. So, know that you can always leave the lights low, and—if a partner is having erectile difficulties—stay open to the likelihood that it has absolutely nothing to do with you, much less your body.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjntand002g3b794wnrwqlx@published"&gt;I’m a 33-year-old man. I realized/admitted to myself that I was bi after I first started dating my now-wife (also 33) seven years ago. We took a break early in our relationship for about a year because of unrelated life events, but because of the circumstances, I wasn’t really able to explore my newly realized sexuality. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/02/cheating-grindr-messages-husband-advice.html"&gt;I only hooked up with one guy during that period and it wasn’t super great, honestly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dana Ellis Hunnes, a senior clinical dietitian at UCLA Health, says her local grocery store often stocks more non-dairy milk options than dairy ones. She’s tried various options, including a brief phase with coconut milk (“It was too creamy and too watery at the same time”). Now, she enjoys &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/19/oat-milk-rises-to-top-as-britains-preferred-plant-based-drink" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;oat milk&lt;/a&gt;, which adds the right amount of creaminess to her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The best choice depends on individual needs and preferences, says Hunnes. One person might want to add more protein to their diet, while another might be looking to increase their calcium intake. Flavor and mouthfeel are also important considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While dairy milk remains the most popular option in the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/402717/cow-milk-increase-america-dairy-plant-milks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/01/full-fat-milk-sales-rise-uk-shoppers-leave-low-calorie-options" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, alternatives are here to stay.

The study, which examined 219 plant-based milk alternatives from 21 brands, found that these alternatives were generally lower in protein and saturated fatty acids than dairy milk. Nutrients are often added to help alternative milks compete with dairy milk; 70% of the products were fortified with calcium and vitamin D, and other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows alternative milks are sometimes also fortified with vitamins A and B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3a239e7b-b6c6-43d9-b507-7a5723d9eba0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Checking the label is important when determining which product is right for you. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: SolStock/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adults likely don’t need to choose an alternative milk that matches dairy milk’s nutrient profile exactly, because they get those nutrients from other parts of their diet – unless they are especially concerned about their calcium intake, explains Dr Joan Sabate, a professor and executive director of the Center for Nutrition, Lifestyle and Disease Prevention at Loma Linda University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Checking the label is important when determining which product is right for you. The study found that the nutrient content of alternative milks varied. For instance, soy milk brands can contain different amounts of protein. “You can’t just pick a plant-based milk off the shelf and assume it’s going to meet your calcium needs,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hunnes does “strongly recommend that people try to go for the unsweetened varieties” to minimize their sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If someone is trying to get more protein, but with as minimal amount of sugar as possible, I might suggest they go for unsweetened pea protein milk or unsweetened soy milk,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For most people, alternative milks will only make up a small part of their overall diet, says Hunnes. With that in mind, these milks “won’t make or break someone’s healthfulness”, says Hunnes. “People should focus on what kind they like best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-alternative-milks-contain-seed-oils" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Do alternative milks contain seed oils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because many alternative milks lack fat, manufacturers may add seed oil to give the liquids a smooth taste and consistency. Seed oils may also be used as emulsifiers to prevent ingredient separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Experts say&lt;/a&gt; research does not support claims that seed oils are toxic or drive chronic disease. But claims like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/nx-s1-5453769/nutrition-canola-rfk-seed-oils-soybean" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Maha figurehead&lt;/a&gt; Robert F Kennedy Jr’s – that Americans are “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/13/robert-f-kennedy-jr-claims-seed-oils-are-poisoning-us-heres-why-hes-wrong" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unknowingly poisoned&lt;/a&gt;” by these products – have led some consumers to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fcb98fd8-99ee-48ba-b445-e7154eefa4cd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"RFK Jr says they are poisoning us, influencers call them unnatural – but what is the truth about seed oils?","elementId":"fcb98fd8-99ee-48ba-b445-e7154eefa4cd","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/29/rfk-jr-says-they-are-poisoning-us-influencers-call-them-unnatural-but-what-is-the-truth-about-seed-oils"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some seed oils can be pro-inflammatory if consumed in very high amounts, explains Hunnes, but the amount of seed oil in some alternative milks isn’t enough to warrant concern, since people are likely to consume only half to a full cup daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unless people are drinking a half a gallon of these non-dairy milks a day, it’s not something I would be concerned about,” says Hunnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research also suggests plant-derived oils may mitigate cardiovascular disease risk factors, says Johnson. “There’s not necessarily anything wrong with wanting to avoid seed oils and emulsifiers, but some perceived risks might not be accurate,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies generally show that these oils are associated with lower mortality than butter, and experts have &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-behind-seed-oils-health-effects" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that the purported adverse effects of seed oils have been conflated with the unhealthy foods they are sometimes used in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-each-alternative-milk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the pros and cons of each alternative milk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Johnson’s study found that soy-based products were most nutritionally similar to dairy milk. This is why Sabate recommends soy milk over other alternatives for children. It is also so similar to dairy milk in that it is the only alternative &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/milk-and-plant-based-milk-alternatives-know-nutrient-difference" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; in the dairy section of the US dietary guidelines for Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Soy also has various beneficial, naturally occurring &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772502222001068" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chemical compounds&lt;/a&gt;, says Sabate. These can support heart, kidney and liver health, she says. These include isoflavones, which are structurally similar to estrogen. This similarity may be why soy milk is linked to a lower &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/does-eating-soy-increase-estrogen-and-cause-breast" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2021/10000/the_women_s_study_for_the_alleviation_of_vasomotor.12.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reduced hot flashes&lt;/a&gt; (although the evidence is mixed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This similarity has led to a false assumption that drinking soy milk could have feminizing effects on men, despite &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20378106/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19524224/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showing that’s not true. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890623820302926" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; of 38 clinical studies found no adverse effects of soy on men. In one extremely &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9593161/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare case&lt;/a&gt;, in which a man’s breasts grew after drinking soy milk, he was consuming 1.2 liters of daily for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to a 2022 UC Davis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2025.2450263#abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, it is the most popular alternative after almond milk, and demand is growing. This may be because oat milk’s sensory qualities are similar to dairy milk; oat milk also often &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contains more sugar&lt;/a&gt; than almond, soy, pea and coconut milks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also contains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;phytates&lt;/a&gt;, compounds with antioxidant properties that can help prevent bone loss and kidney stone formation. Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128169384000033" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that oat milk may be an appropriate dairy substitute for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Oat milk also has &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more fiber&lt;/a&gt; than many alternative milks, except for rice milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Phytates can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534225/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;impair&lt;/a&gt; the absorption of iron, zinc and calcium; however, consuming oat milk along with a balanced, nutrient-rich diet should minimize any adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"7275ee59-782e-4b79-8ed8-715a8a11204f","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="7275ee59-782e-4b79-8ed8-715a8a11204f" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almond milk: &lt;/strong&gt;Those looking for something low-calorie or who are concerned about their blood sugar might want to try unsweetened almond milk, says Hunnes. It might also appeal to consumers who prioritize foods with fewer ingredients; there’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creqge8xgx4o" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising interest&lt;/a&gt; in simpler ingredient lists, so consumers can better understand the health impacts of a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That said, 2023 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that almond milk has less protein than cashew, hemp, pea and soy milk. It has more protein than coconut and rice milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Production of almond milk also involves more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;water use&lt;/a&gt; than other plant-based milks – though dairy production still uses significantly more water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut milk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Coconut milk has high levels of saturated fat, and is thus often marketed as having a mouthfeel similar to whole milk, explains Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="42941aca-a35c-44f5-b88e-a8e8e21fff10" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;There’s some evidence that coconut milk contains antioxidative compounds.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: jayk7/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critically, the American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; limiting saturated fats to less than 6 % of your total calories, so experts &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/the-great-milk-debate-of-2024-which-milk-is-healthier" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More research on coconut milk is needed to understand its health effects. But there is some evidence that it contains antioxidative &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7422486/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt; that protect against DNA oxidative damage, which is linked to ageing-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rice milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Rice milk is made from milled rice and water, and is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/rice-milk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;often fortified&lt;/a&gt; with calcium and vitamin D. Because it is very low in protein – one &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;serving&lt;/a&gt; may contain 0.9 grams of protein, compared with 2.4 grams in oat milk and 1.7 grams in almond milk – experts recommend combining it with other protein-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rice milk may appeal to some because it’s low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996919308580" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;least allergenic&lt;/a&gt; of milk alternatives. It’s sometimes the choice of athletes and others with high energy needs because it contains &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/cow%E2%80%99s-milk-vs-the-alternatives-which-is-best" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All rice can &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.70008" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;potentially&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18385862/#:~:text=Abstract,food%20regulations%20in%20this%20respect." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contain arsenic&lt;/a&gt; because rice plants absorb the element from the soil. There are no dietary limits for arsenic in rice milk, but some reports &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2F1MDzyW55pg97Tdpp7gqLN/should-i-be-concerned-about-arsenic-in-my-rice" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advise caution&lt;/a&gt; around intake for children. Because young children eat three times more food for their size than adults do, they are more likely to take in higher amounts of inorganic arsenic from their diet. For instance, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/arsenic.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that infant rice cereals not contain more than 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s a need for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4779445/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more research&lt;/a&gt; to know the health effects of consuming arsenic via rice milk, though exposure is likely very low unless you’re drinking a lot of rice milk. People &lt;a href="https://hhs.iowa.gov/health-prevention/providers-professionals/center-acute-disease-epidemiology/epi-manual/environmental-disease/arsenic-poisoning" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consume&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 5 to 25 micrograms of arsenic daily as part of their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blended milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Blended milks are relatively new and need further study. One 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224423003837#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; suggests blended milks have a more similar mouthfeel to dairy milk than non-blended alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some alternative milk products combine various plant protein sources, and may be fortified with calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you want a product with a higher protein content, opt for soy or pea, which naturally contain protein, or blended products with those ingredients, says Johnson. Pea milk, for example, may have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;7 grams&lt;/a&gt; more protein per one-cup serving than almond milk, and also naturally contains vitamin A.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkryke3004t27nrb5uxbz42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People looking to lose weight and lower their blood sugar may someday be able to get a single injection that turns their cells into tiny factories churning out a protein that is essentially the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00033b6qtc0l6ze8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s the ambition of two biotech startups, New York-based RenBio and Fractyl Health in Massachusetts. Both companies have completed initial tests showing that their approaches work, at least in mice, and both have started tests in larger animals — pigs and monkeys — to see whether their gene therapies can work in larger animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00043b6qp5nbprgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With continued success and enough funding, they hope to bring the therapies to human patients — although it may take years more research to prove that their ideas work and are safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00053b6qcc4lb7o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer GLP-1 medications – available as injections and pills – have proven to be highly effective for weight loss, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00063b6qq5f058tc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone made by the body that helps signal to the brain and the gut that it’s full and doesn’t need to eat any more. The new weight loss drugs mimic the action of this hormone by increasing the secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar. They also slow the movement of food through the digestive tract, which helps people feel full more quickly and for longer, and they work in the brain to reduce appetite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00073b6qvw6dct54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In less than two years, the percentage of American adults using these meds for weight loss has roughly doubled, rising from 5.8% to 12%, according to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;a recent Gallup report&lt;/a&gt;. Their popularity may finally be making a dent in the nation’s obesity rate, which dropped from 39.9% in 2023 to 37% in 2025, according to Gallup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00083b6q1krx5qoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the medicines can be expensive, and up to half of users say they have side effects including nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Studies suggest that people need to continue using them to maintain their weight loss, but many people don’t love the idea of staying on them indefinitely. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly two-thirds of people without diabetes who started GLP-1 drugs stopped within a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00093b6qjibnhy3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next wave of research has sought to capitalize on the benefits of GLP-1s with fewer downsides. That’s where companies like Fractyl and RenBio come in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna000a3b6q4l0dg5nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fractyl is presenting &lt;a href="https://planion-client-files.s3.amazonaws.com/TOS/blobs/269179c7-14eb-4d25-8546-a221f38def74/1/HANDOUT_OW_2025_Seeley_et_al_PGTx.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the latest results&lt;/a&gt; from its trial of a gene therapy called Rejuva in mice at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society, called ObesityWeek, which is being held in Atlanta this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna000b3b6qgdll4hhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio shared its results from ongoing mouse studies as a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.30.656889v3" target="_blank"&gt;preprint paper&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it has not been peer reviewed or accepted into a medical journal, last month.  RenBio will also present updated findings at ObesityWeek.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrynfc00003b6qy9s3myh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio calls its technology “Make Your Own,” and it’s a relatively simple idea. They use a plasmid — a ring of naked DNA — in saline solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000j3b6q1etik32f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the instructions that the body uses to build and constantly refurbish itself. It lives in the nucleus, or brain, of every cell as a twisting, double-sided ladder. The ladder is made up of four individual nucleic acids, like the letters that make up words in a book, strung together in long chains that spell out the instructions for proteins.  The order of the letters tells the body how to make the proteins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000k3b6qjh7172g5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In RenBio’s case, the researchers spelled out the instructions to make a GLP-1 receptor agonist protein — essentially the same active ingredient in medicines like Ozempic and Mounjaro — and looped it into a small circle called a plasmid. They injected saline solution containing these plasmids into muscle tissue and used short electrical pulses — milliseconds long — to zap the muscle cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000l3b6qyultd0ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It works really efficiently. Basically, the electrical pulses transiently make little pores in the cell membrane that allow the DNA rings to slip into the cell,” said Dr. Rachel Liberatore, president and chief scientific officer at RenBio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000m3b6qpvn1tyd6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From there, the plasmids migrate to the nucleus, where they hang out in the jelly-like cytoplasm. When the cell gets ready to translate its own DNA, the plasmid DNA is read and translated right alongside it. When the cell reads the instructions, it builds the GLP-1 receptor agonist protein and releases it into the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000n3b6qcftrvrhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberatore said that although RenBio’s therapy uses a genetic technology, it’s not a traditional gene therapy: The researchers aren’t trying to fix a broken gene. Rather, they’re using the cell’s own machinery to turn it into a protein factory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000o3b6qwpsmy6om@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The DNA we’re injecting, the plasmid DNA, doesn’t interfere with your own DNA in any way. So it doesn’t interfere with your own chromosomes. It doesn’t integrate. It’s not something you’re going to pass on to your children,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000p3b6qx0ksenod@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio is also using this platform to make protein therapies that can be built in the same way, like antibodies to the Zika virus. The work is supported by the federal government’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA.  It’s also supported by the Wellcome Trust, a health research foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000q3b6qqrqo599p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In RenBio’s most successful experiments, mice injected with the plasmids lost about 15% of their body weight, which was significantly more than mice in a placebo group. The loss was maintained for at least a year after they received the plasmid DNA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000r3b6qzlxvp0a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In each formulation tested, the weight loss leveled off in mice treated with the plasmids. In essence, they hit a plateau. But that’s a good thing if you’re using a long-acting therapy, Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000s3b6qo4retzt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were actually quite happy to see that, because you don’t necessarily want continued weight loss for a year, a year and a half,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000t3b6q1fwpxz25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Glucose tolerance tests show that blood sugar was better regulated, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000u3b6q72u7pkur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers aren’t sure how long the plasmids may remain active. The idea is that a doctor might give their patients a shot every year or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000v3b6qqk8ns438@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think what our take on it is, it’s really ideally suited for the sort of maintenance phase that people are starting to talk about with GLP-1s,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000w3b6qcqk5tlr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plasmid platform has also been tested on monkeys, and the researchers even used the device to inject themselves – albeit with pure saline, not with any plasmids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000x3b6qtuatzmjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio hopes to begin testing its plasma platform to deliver instructions for making antibodies against the Zika virus in people next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmhks0xpl000z3b6qhjyxc85q@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="targeting-cells-to-help-the-body-make-more-glp-1" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Targeting cells to help the body make more GLP-1
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0dvy000h3b6qqbsqpd6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another company called Fractyl Health is taking a slightly different approach. It uses a more traditional gene therapy technique in which the outer shell of a small virus — called an adeno-associated virus — slips DNA into cells and givens them the instructions to make GLP-1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00143b6q6pwhjabm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In rare cases, when viruses are used to deliver genes, they can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to potentially dangerous inflammation, allergic reactions or organ damage. In other cases, gene therapy vectors like viruses may wind up where they’re not supposed to be and can introduce errors into the genomes of cells, which &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cdnews/news/1778/Gene-Therapy-Causes-Cancer-in-Some-Children" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001i3b6q35y2j5wp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea is that a single treatment delivered directly to the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas would never need to be repeated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00153b6qwfnfqph3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because we are delivering it locally, we believe that we will need a very low dose of this virus, which helps gives us confidence in the potential safety in people,” said Dr. Harith Rajagopalan, co-founder and CEO of Fractyl Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00163b6qt7hr65jz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers have tried this in mice and pigs, and both tests were successful, Rajagopalan said. But mice and pigs aren’t humans, and many therapies that have succeeded in lab animals have gone on to fail in people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00173b6qqnjfiejg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is promise, but much more data would be needed to consider human clinical trials, as it likely would be irreversible,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, a distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics, at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at the University of California – Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00183b6qjkecfx0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The concern would be, the genetic change would be permanent so if there is over-expression … which may change with various states — weight loss, illness, aging, hormonal changes — it could cause problems from over-expression with no way to reverse, except remove the pancreas or treated muscle,” Kohn said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00193b6qhs823sdt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kohn said there has long been a debate in gene therapy about whether it should be used for non-disease treatment, such as enhancement of height or muscle mass. In general, the feeling is that it should not be used for enhancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001a3b6qi1wz5iny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This certainly is near that line between Medicine and enhancement and so I think that’s another reason that needs to be considered whether this is something that should be gone into,” Kohn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001b3b6qr8kg9zng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fractyl says it has filed the regulatory paperwork in the US to start human trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001c3b6qit552yn4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We anticipate seeing human data in the next year, in 2026,” Rajagopalan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001d3b6qxuvm1mvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viruses are experts at infecting cells, so scientists use that capability to slip DNA into a cell, so the cell can start building the proteins the researchers want it to build – in this case, GLP-1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001e3b6q50cp7zbl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gene therapy like this can be risky, however, so in order to minimize the risk, the researchers designed their DNA to recognize the promoter sequence for insulin. Promoter sequences are short stretches of DNA that tell the cell’s copying machinery where a new protein starts. It acts like an on/off switch in the DNA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001f3b6q0rbd0kco@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By having the DNA sequence for GLP-1 recognize the insulin promoter, the researchers tied the function of their sequence to the production of insulin, another hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001g3b6qq8m9x63t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means only cells that make insulin will also make GLP-1, limiting the dose that’s delivered to the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001h3b6qj08c9qho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also creates a way to dial up or down the volume of extra GLP-1. When a mouse eats a high-fat, high-calorie meal, its body will make more insulin but also more GLP-1, to guard against weight gain. When it eats a more moderate serving of its normal chow, it won’t make as much GLP-1, so it won’t lose weight when it doesn’t need to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001j3b6q0z1jkfnx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In mice, the results have been encouraging, said Dr. Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies hormone signaling as it relates to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Fractyl hired Seeley to test the gene therapy, and he owns stock options in the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001k3b6qurx2gwh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Obese mice that were treated with the gene therapy, which Fractyl calls Rejuva, lost about 20% of their body weight within three weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001l3b6qlruvbgcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It outperformed semaglutide,” the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, Rajagopalan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When researchers treated normal-weight mice with the gene therapy and then fed them a high-fat diet, the mice did not gain weight. Their blood sugar also stayed normal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When they gave the gene therapy to lean mice who ate their normal diet, the lean mice didn’t lose excessive amounts of weight. They also didn’t seem to develop dangerously low blood sugar, suggesting that it might be safe to use to prevent obesity as well as treat and maintain it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It might also be a way to prevent diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Rajagopalan envisions a day when it might be possible to identify people at risk of obesity, because of a family history or other factors, and give them gene therapy to prevent that fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001q3b6qj4gl9gqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a food environment where processed foods have been engineered to trick the brain into eating unhealthy amounts, he sees this gene therapy as potentially helping people regain control over their appetite and health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Food is cheaper per calorie and more widely available than at any point in human history,” Rajagopalan said. “We’re just not built to make enough GLP-1 for the world around us.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001s3b6qdcqrfqpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The solution, he said, may be helping the body make more of its own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There’s a long way to go before you get there, and we can’t minimize the work involved. I mean, that’s equivalent to saying we’re going to colonize Mars, in terms of the magnitude of effort involved to get there,” Rajagopalan said. “But why not aspire to aspire to that?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3e93a3c9-94b8-4fc1-952b-2c6e11f9bb57"&gt;Can we change bad memories? In this adapted excerpt from "How to Change a Memory" (Princeton University Press, 2025), author and neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Steve Ramirez&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recounts the events that led him and his colleagues to discover memories could be artificially controlled in rodents, by tapping directly into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="078937a2-fe8a-4c02-8291-f0e714027515"&gt;&lt;p id="ad4660bd-5c49-4f3b-b60d-82dee64909d4" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Feelings like anxiety are hard to understand because they're often invisible to everyone else. But they're part of everyday life. We all regularly experience bouts of stress and anxiety. What if the job interviewer doesn't like me? Should I cram tonight for my exam tomorrow? What should I say on my first date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ad4660bd-5c49-4f3b-b60d-82dee64909d4-1"&gt;Our biology often forces us to be prepared for multiple outcomes in the midst of uncertainty. It's healthy to care about these multiple outcomes because it encourages us to put in the work, to adequately prep for a given stressful event. And yet, sometimes the scales of stress become tilted to such an extreme that pathologies of the brain begin to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tremendous variation in how any individual arrives at a state of anxiety, for example, highlights that our brain contains many winding roads that can ultimately converge on the same feeling. We all have our triggers in life, but what those triggers are depends on experience — on memory. When these differences impair our mood, thinking, behavior and overall daily functioning, then they get lumped into a category. What's more, if observed impairments share similar features, then this category itself falls within a broader classification — that of a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="35543d0f-56ff-4e96-9f29-3ca1a42fa8af"&gt;As I was entering my last year of graduate school, I was just beginning to understand how omnipresent an anxious feeling can truly be. Just as my own stressors in life began accumulating — finishing my thesis, writing grants and job applications, continuing the seemingly never-ending search for purpose as a scientist and person — my mom too had a sudden resurgence of anxious moments that ultimately culminated in frequent panic attacks. Once I learned about her lifelong experience with the erratic thing that anxiety was for her, I started to appreciate the on-again, off-again and on-again nature of these feelings. I couldn’t stop thinking about her panic attacks and how frustrating it was to not be able to press "&lt;em&gt;off" &lt;/em&gt;on some of the most debilitating moments one can endure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1bdcf3da-c9c8-4153-839d-6d30921a8ac6"&gt;My last project in graduate school would attempt to artificially activate positive memories to suppress the symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. It would be my most personal scientific endeavor, a very direct way for me to join the fight at my mom's side and to thank her for being my superhero. If my research could somehow inspire new therapeutic strategies that might be useful for alleviating these kinds of debilitating conditions, then my work will have gained an even deeper, more personally meaningful purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lab partner Xu Liu and I wanted to take a brain-centric approach to our newest project. Could memory itself be artificially controlled in rodents, by tapping directly into the brain to restore neuronal and behavioral balance in a therapeutic name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-u39R7hRxDfKpmnR8cZS6wm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-u39R7hRxDfKpmnR8cZS6wm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, our project had a scientific precedent in humans — in an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3128334/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3128334/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influential paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by psychologist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/barbara-fredrickson/" target="_blank" data-url="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/barbara-fredrickson/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Barbara Fredrickson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues called "The undoing effect of positive emotions." This study highlighted the capacity of positive emotions to undo the physiological effects that negative emotions have on the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undoing hypothesis proposes that positive emotions can be used for more than just feeling good. They can be used to help us get out of bed in the morning; pursue happiness; change how we think about and interact with ourselves and others; and counteract, or at least regulate, negative emotions. When human subjects were stressed and then watched movie clips that elicited contentment and amusement, their bodies rebounded in beneficial ways: their stress-induced increases in cardiovascular activity, for instance, returned to baseline faster than when they watched neutral or sad movie clips. Excitingly, this reveals a very real physical connection between feelings of positivity and their direct effects on our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xu and I wanted to further this work by testing for a potential therapeutic capacity of positive memories by jump-starting their biology from within&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the brain. We placed our animals in a box that had two small valves on separate ends: one that delivered sugar water when the animals licked it and another that delivered regular water. This is known as the sucrose preference test. Rodents normally prefer sugar water over regular water, the same way humans will typically find sugary liquids preferable to a bland liquid. On the other hand, rodents with depression-and anxiety-related behaviors tend to show a 50:50 preference. They show no preference at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the animals displaying anxiety-and depression-related behavior licked at each of the valves randomly over the course of 15 minutes. As with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://behavioralscientist.org/manipulating-memory-through-optogenetics-qa-with-neuroscientists-xu-liu-and-steve-ramirez/" target="_blank" data-url="https://behavioralscientist.org/manipulating-memory-through-optogenetics-qa-with-neuroscientists-xu-liu-and-steve-ramirez/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — our first successful attempt at MIT to artificially control memories in the rodent brain — all we had to do was hit a button that would turn our lasers on and optogenetically awaken a memory from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep-blue laser flickered throughout the mouse’s hippocampus, waking up — activating&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— cells that held onto a positive memory. I remember thinking that our optogenetic stimulation was a fancy, high-tech Proustian madeleine, one capable of triggering the rich remembrance of things past. If you'll entertain my romanticization of the moment: the mouse perked up immediately, as if a shudder ran from its brain to its body, and it began scanning the environment to decide which valve to visit first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary thing was happening. I imagine that the mouse felt the memory invade all its senses, strangely detached and with no suggestion of an origin, since the essence of these sensations was &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;the mouse as much as it &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;the mouse. And once the positive memory fully revealed itself within seconds, the now-motivated mouse inspected each valve with some sniffing, followed by a taste test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f31f1ee4-25fd-437a-a4be-34016c009bf8"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to reversing abnormal behavior was embedded within their positive memories all along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="316ea602-7387-4367-984c-5634c5157a9e"&gt;When it found the valve with the sugar water, the mouse started licking vigorously, so much so that it consumed as much sugar water as our control animals. In under an hour, Xu and I saw that reactivating positive memories restored our mice's behavior to a healthy baseline. Just as exciting, reactivating positive memories also turned on many areas of the brain involved in rewarding experiences and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to reversing abnormal behavior was embedded within their positive memories all along. For as long as the laser was shining its sapphire radiance in their brains, the mice were motivated to keep consuming their sugar water reward. All this from stimulating cells in the hippocampus. Or to say this with less novelistic flare: the mice got a sugary treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following weeks, one of my gifted undergraduates &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/briana-chen" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/briana-chen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Briana Chen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; collected a large empirical dataset for the project, and it came with an exciting plot twist: when she artificially reactivated positive memories twice a day, or "chronically," for about a week, not only did this permanently ameliorate symptoms we believed were associated with depression and anxiety, but it also promoted&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the growth of new cells in the brain. Positive memories had both short- and long-term benefits, all the way from cells to behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;neuro-centric Research Domain Criteria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (RDoC) approach to treating the brain, our hope was that the biological potency of positive memories — like medications — could inform cognitive-behavioral approaches to treating disorders of the brain. This project was meaningful to me on a personal level: I thought of my mom's panic attacks and the idea that she might never have to experience the kind of crippling anxiety that robs someone of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive memories are some of the most powerful biological tools available in our brains. At home, my mom and I shared a treasure trove of them — one that we both remember is from the time when I was a teenager, and we were visiting her parents in El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning, my cousins, parents and grandparents all walked down a hill behind the house my mom grew up in to go swimming in the village pond. My cousins kept egging me on to jump from a cliff into the pond, and my mom kept telling me I didn't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like her, I was the opposite of an adrenaline-seeker because, oh I don't know, maybe my innate biology was onto something, as "please do not free-fall to Earth" kept repeating in my mind. She could see that I was scared, and after a few minutes she suggested, much to my surprise, that we jump together. We held hands and tiptoed to the edge — &lt;em&gt;uno&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tres &lt;/em&gt;— we were in the air! Moments later, we emerged from the water laughing in delightful disbelief at our newfound courage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b080303f-477d-4385-9c00-161cb1364dd7"&gt;Neuroscience tells us that this memory has all the ingredients of life's dessert that make us feel good. From an RDoC perspective, my cognitive and valence systems are all interacting to produce the riches from this experience: the cognitive system enables the memory of jumping off of a cliff, which at first generated feelings of fear via the negative valence systems, which are now almost immediately counteracted by feelings of reward via the positive valence systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once a moment of fear is now a memory of triumph with my mom. It's the only time I can remember when we both took a literal leap of faith, so we cherish the memory as an example of what our brains can achieve together. A million little life moments like these, packaged neatly into a million memories that we hold onto constitute the good stuff in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="442bfef3-8420-4720-8bcd-ef948a521e15"&gt;&lt;p id="dda2c8cc-94c4-4bc2-b874-e2c0b49c5ff8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from &lt;/em&gt;"How To Change a Memory: One Neuroscientist's Quest To Alter The Past"&lt;em&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj1kz000e3b77qvvbbcim@published"&gt;I had what I thought was an excellent interview. Seemed to hit it off with the manager. She even gave me her direct phone number and said she would have an answer the following week. She seemed to like all my answers to her questions. We also bonded over the fact her mom has dementia and I told her my grandmother had Alzheimer’s. I wound up receiving another job offer. So over a week went by I called and left her a message. I never heard back. I then called my HR contact and told her I received a job offer but their job opening was my first choice. The HR person assured me she would get me an answer and that she would let me know either way by the end of that day. I never heard from either of them! It’s been over two weeks, and I took the other job. But I’m feeling like I was ghosted. I’m trying not to feel offended, but I just feel it was unprofessional to treat me that way. What’s your opinion?&lt;br&gt;—Ghosted&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hy000l3b77ixdnebfw@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Ghosted,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hz000m3b77gpwsbvuk@published"&gt;Job searching in 2025 feels like it was designed by a sadist. You send applications off into the void, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; get an acknowledgement that it was even received, and then if you’re lucky and your resume somehow makes it past the AI screening because it stood out among the hundreds of others that the company received, you get called for an interview. But even that human interaction doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll be treated like an actual human afterwards—it seems that getting ghosted is sadly the rule these days, not the exception. It’s as if recruiters are taking a cue from the worst serial daters, the ones who go on a great date and then just never follow up.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hz000n3b77dvz9gxdy@published"&gt;Ghosting culture is rude, it’s painful, and it’s also bewildering, especially when you have what seemed like a good interview where you really hit it off with the person interviewing you! It can make you feel crazy, like you’ve been totally gaslit and you can’t trust your instincts about anything. How hard is it to just send an email that says, “You didn’t get the job”? (I’m sure they could figure out a nicer way to say it, but that’s the gist.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hz000o3b77kvm1r5n8@published"&gt;All this to say: I agree it was unprofessional of them to treat you this way, you have every right to feel offended, and now it’s time to move on. Try to be grateful that you had another job offer come through at the same time and put the ghosters out of your mind, and focus on your new role. And congrats on it, by the way. Who knows—maybe you dodged a bullet at the other company. They don’t deserve you, anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

How do I handle this, job-wise? Obviously I don’t need or want to give my boss a 16-month notice, but two weeks seems kind of cruel when I know this far in advance. And how soon do I start job searching in the new state? As soon as possible seems ideal theoretically, but no one is going to hire a candidate who can’t start for another year, right?&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s way too early to start looking for a job in another state. There’s often a little bit of a chicken-and-egg game that happens when you are hoping to move to a different state and get a job—a lot of companies won’t look at out of state applicants, but moving without a job is very stressful and might make it more difficult to rent an apartment or get established in your new home. I would start looking a couple of months before you’re planning on moving, and either use a friend’s address in your new state on your resume or be very clear that you are moving no matter what. Or maybe the perfect remote role will open up and you won’t have to worry about finding a new job at all! I’ll put that out into the universe for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Things could change in 16 months! Your timeline could shift, for one thing, and you don’t want to quit so far in advance that you find yourself with an unsustainable gap between jobs. Also, I hate to even mention this, but it’s possible you could lose your job in the next 16 months. Personally I would give no more than one month, and that’s only if you really feel obligated to give that much. I can hear in your letter that you don’t want to let down your boss, and while that’s admirable, trust me when I say that no company is as loyal to you as you may feel to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkoy9n3003ymfktsnsjyqap@published"&gt;I just started a new job, and I’m still trying to make a good impression. But my new boss just enthusiastically shared something that made my heart sink. The one thing I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enjoy in my last job was after-hours team events. They weren’t frequent, twice a year, but I hated them. Sometimes, there was a benefit for attending (like free dinner) other times there was actually a cost (like potluck?!) but honestly, either way, I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wanted to go. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/07/work-advice-after-hours-team-events-avoid.html"&gt;Well, this job is going to have even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; after-hours team events! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This altered processing appears not only in the brain but also at the level of the spinal cord, potentially affecting the fundamental sense of self. The findings, published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03130-w" target="_blank"&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, provide a deeper look into the biological underpinnings of self-disturbance in psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychotic disorders like schizophrenia are often characterized by a disrupted sense of self. This can manifest in symptoms like hallucinations or delusions, where individuals might misattribute their own inner thoughts or actions to an outside source. Researchers have long theorized that these complex symptoms may originate from more fundamental difficulties in processing basic bodily signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists, primarily from Linköping University in Sweden, sought to investigate this idea by examining how the nervous system handles sensations that are self-generated compared to those that come from the external world. Their goal was to use a variety of methods to get a comprehensive picture of self-related processing across different sensory systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Schizophrenia is a complex disorder, and its underlying neurobiological mechanisms are still not understood. Especially, how hallucinations and delusions develop and are maintained remains unclear,” said study author &lt;a href="https://rebeccaboehme.com/rebeccaboehme/" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Böhme&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at the Center for Social and Affective Neuroscience at &lt;a href="https://liu.se/en/research/csan/labs/bohme-lab" target="_blank"&gt;Linköping University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hypothesized that a disturbance in the ability of identify self-produced sensations can underlie these symptoms, for example when the own thoughts are not identified as ‘self-produced,’ then they might cause the experience of voices in the head or being controlled from outside forces. Similar for touch: not identifying self-evoked tactile sensations can cause the feeling of ‘something else’ touching you, which the brain then will try to explain – potentially with a quite irrational story, because the brain always looks for causes to its experiences. It might for example come up with the idea, that an invisible demon is following and controlling you through touch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted a series of experiments with 35 patients diagnosed with psychotic disorders and 35 healthy control participants who were matched for age and sex. The experiments were designed to measure neural and behavioral responses to both touch and internal body signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very common misconception is that schizophrenia means having two or more personalities,” Böhme noted. “Schizophrenia is a complicates psychiatric condition, where affected individuals experience symptoms like hallucinations and delusions, but also depression, executive dysfunction, and difficulties in social interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one part of the study, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, which measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. While in the scanner, they were asked to perform or receive gentle strokes on their left forearm. The conditions included touching their own arm, being touched by an experimenter, and touching a pillow as a control for movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that when participants with psychosis touched themselves, a brain region known as the right superior temporal gyrus showed significantly higher activation compared to the control group. In healthy individuals, the brain tends to show reduced activity in response to self-touch, a phenomenon thought to occur because the sensation is predictable. The heightened activation in the patient group suggests there may be a mismatch between the brain’s prediction of the sensation and the sensory information it actually receives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate sensory processing at an even earlier stage, the researchers used a technique to measure somatosensory evoked potentials. This method involves delivering small, non-painful electrical pulses to a nerve in the hand and then recording the speed and strength of that signal as it travels up the spinal cord and into the brain. These measurements were taken during different conditions, including self-touch and other-touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the control group, there was a measurable difference in the timing of the signal at the spinal cord level between self-touch and other-touch. For the patient group, this distinction was significantly smaller, providing evidence that the ability to differentiate between self and other may be altered at a very basic level of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A behavioral experiment provided further support for these neural findings. The researchers measured participants’ tactile thresholds, or the lightest touch they could feel, using a set of fine filaments. This test was also conducted during self-touch and other-touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy controls tended to be less sensitive to the filaments while touching themselves, consistent with the idea that the brain dampens the perception of predictable, self-produced sensations. The patients with psychosis did not show this difference in sensitivity between the two conditions, suggesting an alteration in this sensory filtering mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also explored interoception, which is the sense of the internal state of the body. Participants performed a heartbeat detection task where they tried to tap a button in sync with their own heartbeat without feeling their pulse. The patients were found to be less accurate in this task compared to controls. Both groups performed equally well on a control task where they tapped along to a recorded heartbeat, indicating that the difficulty was specific to perceiving internal signals and not related to general attention or motor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers measured heartbeat-evoked potentials, which are the brain’s electrical responses to the signals from the heart. The analysis showed that patients with psychosis had a reduced brain response to their own heartbeat signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these interoceptive findings point to a broad disruption in the processing of self-generated internal signals, which are essential for maintaining a stable sense of one’s own body. The researchers also found that the degree of alteration in touch-related measures was associated with the severity of certain symptoms, and the brain activity during self-touch was a strong predictor of group membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show “that it is crucial for all of us to be able to differentiate between ‘self’ and ‘other,'” Böhme told PsyPost. “This basic self-other-distinction forms the basis of our self-experience. If this ability is altered or disrupted in some way, also our higher order sense of self will be affected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Schizophrenia, the condition we studied here, is an example of such an alterations. It has been suggested before that schizophrenia can be understood as a disorder of the self. The other key take-away is that this difference is not only sensed in the brain but already affects earlier processing, like in our study the neural processing of self- or other-touch in the spinal cord.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, has some limitations. The patient sample was taking medication, which could potentially influence sensory processing, although the researchers conducted additional analyses that did not suggest a clear medication effect. The patients also had relatively low levels of active symptoms and included a mix of different psychotic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that future work could examine individuals at earlier stages of the illness or before they begin treatment to see if these findings hold. Investigating these mechanisms further could open new avenues for therapies aimed at correcting the fundamental sensory and self-processing disruptions seen in psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My lab studies the sense of self in many different psychiatric conditions and life situations,” Böhme said. “We have also investigated self-other-distinction for example in autism, ADHD, and anorexia. In my newest study, I will investigate how the sense of self is altered in times of grief, i.e. when losing a loved one, and whether people with complicated grief can be better supported using the psychedelic substance psilocybin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-025-03130-w" target="_blank"&gt;Altered processing of self-produced sensations in psychosis at cortical and spinal levels&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Paula C.

(WITN) - The N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission is looking into a possible case of a contagious disease among deer in Edgecombe County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;N.C. Wildlife is reporting a potential case of Chronic Wasting Disease, or CWD, after a preliminary test result from a three-and-a-half-year-old male white-tailed deer came back positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials say the deer was harvested by a hunter in the eastern corner of the county, a few miles from the Pitt-Martin County line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;If confirmed as positive, the deer would be the 35th CWD-positive deer found in North Carolina since the initial detection of the disease in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The sample is currently being tested by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory to verify the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The closest confirmed location from this new suspected site is in Cumberland County, nearly 100 miles away, according to officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;CWD is transmissible to other deer and spreads through infected body fluids, like saliva, urine, feces and the movement of infected deer carcasses and carcass parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Because deer may appear healthy during the early stages of infection, officials are stressing to hunters the importance of taking precautions when moving or disposing of deer carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;N.C. Wildlife asks hunters to submit deer harvested in Edgecombe County and the surrounding areas for testing. They’re also asked to keep the deer and its high-risk carcass parts in the county of origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;All hunters are encouraged to follow these disposal methods for non-edible portions of carcasses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="list | article-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bury deer remains where you harvest the animal when possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Double-bag deer remains for disposal in a landfill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leave the deer remains on the ground where the animal was harvested&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Low-risk carcass parts, like boned-out meat, caped hides, antlers, cleaned jawbones, skulls and teeth, as well as finished taxidermy products, are safe to transport outside of Edgecombe County. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control have not reported any cases of CWD infection in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;N.C.

In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, scientists from Mass General Brigham found that greater physical activity was linked to slower cognitive decline in older adults who had higher levels of amyloid-beta, a protein strongly tied to Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, people who walked between 3,000 and 5,000 steps a day experienced about three years of delay in cognitive decline. Those who walked 5,000 to 7,500 steps per day saw that delay extend to around seven years. In contrast, participants who were largely inactive showed faster accumulation of tau proteins in the brain, which is associated with Alzheimer's progression, and more rapid declines in thinking skills and daily functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This sheds light on why some people who appear to be on an Alzheimer's disease trajectory don't decline as quickly as others," said senior author Jasmeer Chhatwal, MD, PhD, of the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. "Lifestyle factors appear to impact the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that lifestyle changes may slow the emergence of cognitive symptoms if we act early."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Study on Activity and Brain Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined 296 individuals aged 50 to 90 who showed no cognitive impairment at the start of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants wore waistband pedometers to track physical activity and underwent PET scans to measure amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain. They completed yearly cognitive assessments over a period ranging from two to 14 years (average = 9.3 years), and a subset received additional brain scans to monitor changes in tau over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that participants with elevated amyloid-beta who took more daily steps experienced slower cognitive decline and a slower buildup of tau proteins. Statistical modeling indicated that the primary benefit of physical activity came from its association with slower tau accumulation. Among participants with low amyloid-beta levels, there was little evidence of either cognitive decline or tau buildup, and no significant link to activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Cognitive Resilience Through Movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are thrilled that data from the Harvard Aging Brain Study has helped the field better understand the importance of physical activity for maintaining brain health," said co-author Reisa Sperling, MD, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham and co-principal investigator of the Harvard Aging Brain Study. "These findings show us that it's possible to build cognitive resilience and resistance to tau pathology in the setting of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. This is particularly encouraging for our quest to ultimately prevent Alzheimer's disease dementia, as well as to decrease dementia due to multiple contributing factors."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team plans to further explore which types of physical activity are most beneficial, including how intensity and long-term exercise patterns might influence brain health. They also aim to uncover the biological mechanisms that connect physical activity, tau buildup, and cognitive function. The researchers believe these insights could inform future clinical trials that test whether exercise-based interventions can slow cognitive decline in older adults, particularly those at elevated risk for Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Empowering People to Take Action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want to empower people to protect their brain and cognitive health by keeping physically active," said first-author Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, MD, a cognitive neurologist at Mass General Brigham. "Every step counts -- and even small increases in daily activities can build over time to create sustained changes in habit and health."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Usually, the chemical mist released when &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-s-the-real-reason-cutting-onions-make-you-cry-according-to-science"&gt;onions are chopped&lt;/a&gt; – propanethial S-oxide – makes our eyes water. Now scientists have found a simple way to keep those tears to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In experiments by researchers from Cornell University in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-stone-technologies-suggest-early-humans-were-social-across-long-distances"&gt;sharper blades&lt;/a&gt; and slower cuts significantly reduced the amount of onion mist given off during preparation, keeping eyes drier and kitchen surfaces safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biomechanist Zixuan Wu and team used a mini guillotine, a high-resolution camera, and sensors to carefully track the droplets expelled as onions were cut, comparing mist characteristics against knife sharpness, chopping speed, and cutting force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-absolute-worst-thickness-for-a-paper-cut"&gt;Scientists Reveal The Absolute Worst Thickness For a Paper Cut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found out the speed of the mist coming out is much higher compared to the speed of the blade cutting through," &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/10/mist-opportunity-reveals-how-onions-make-cooks-cry"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; physicist Sunghwan Jung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179666" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DropletAnalysis.jpg" alt="Onion mist analysis" class="wp-image-179666 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DropletAnalysis.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DropletAnalysis-600x265.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179666" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used high-resolution imagery to track droplet travel. (Wu et al., &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every layer in an onion has a top and bottom skin, and as those layers are breached, the analysis showed there are two resulting effects: an instantaneous explosion of mist, and then a slower seep of fluids through the layers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blunter knives created substantially more droplets and faster sprays, the researchers found. Because they require more force to break the skins, pressure builds in the onion's juices. Quicker, forceful cuts with a dull blade propelled droplets even farther.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial ejection of the droplets can be at very high speeds, the observations showed, and can get up to 40 meters per second – that's 144 kilometers (89 miles) per hour. It's these droplets that pose the greatest threats to eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were also able to debunk the common theory that chilled onions give off less mist and are better at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-your-body-may-need-to-shed-some-tears-even-if-you-don-t-feel-sad"&gt;reducing tears&lt;/a&gt; related to chopping. The starting temperature of the onions didn't appear to make any real difference; if anything, chilling them made things worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These observations were supported by theoretical models that accurately capture independently measured fracture forces," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2512779122"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of onions in the kitchen stretches back some 5,000 years, and there's even a mention of the tears that live in an onion in Shakespeare's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra"&gt;Antony and Cleopatra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we have a much better idea of how the aerosols that cause those tears are created and released, and what can be done about it. Using sharp blades and gentle cuts keeps the droplet mist below eye level, the team found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery has implications for food safety, too. If bacteria are present, cutting style influences how they spread. As we saw with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-ingredient-behind-deadly-mcdonalds-outbreak-identified"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; outbreak at McDonald's in the US&lt;/a&gt; just last year, many people can get sick very quickly through pathogens spread by onions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Suppose you have pathogens on the very top layer on the onion," &lt;a href="https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2025/10/mist-opportunity-reveals-how-onions-make-cooks-cry"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jung. "By cutting this onion these pathogens can become encapsulated in droplets where they can then spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2512779122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

We don’t have a complete picture of virus circulation of the variants that are out there,” says Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of the department of epidemic and pandemic management at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. “I think there’s a collective amnesia right now about COVID-19,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if people do test positive after using a home antibody test, there is no way to report a positive result in the community, says Antonia Ho, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Glasgow, UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without high-quality surveillance data, Ho warns that health organizations are not well-prepared to recommend corresponding vaccine formulations and time their roll-out. “Surveillance is critical to really understand what’s circulating,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is COVID-19 being tracked?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although surveillance data that are used to track the absolute number of SARS-CoV-2 infections are less robust than during the pandemic, researchers are tracking information about the number of people with severe COVID-19 who require hospitalization. “Hospital-based surveillance is what we’re mostly doing. But we also have wastewater surveillance, which is quite a useful indicator of what’s happening in the community,” Ho says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genomic analysis of samples containing the SARS‑CoV‑2 virus shows that the most common variants currently circulating globally are XFG, also known as Stratus or the 'Frankenstein variant', and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. Stratus accounts for 76% of reported cases and is dominant in Europe and the Americas, whereas Nimbus is dominant in the Western Pacific region, accounting for 15% of cases, says Van Kerkhove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00459-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03412-x/d41586-025-03412-x_50648964.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Researchers overlooked airborne diseases for centuries — then COVID-19 changed everything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratus and Nimbus have similar symptoms to previous variants including a fever, cough and runny nose, but the Nimbus variant has one distinct symptom: a ‘razor blade’ sore throat. These two variants are currently on the WHO’s list of ‘currently circulating COVID-19 variants under monitoring’ as of 4 September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Kerkhove says the latest information about SARS‑CoV‑2 strains is far from the complete picture of viral circulation. Even hospitalization data aren’t as complete as they were during the pandemic — &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track="click" data-label="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;fewer than 35&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track="click" data-label="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/hospitalizations" data-track-category="body text link"&gt; countries still report COVID-19 data&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s why we’re trying to make sure that countries are still doing sequencing,” says Van Kerkhove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she adds that the surveillance data currently available are sufficient to “provide information to governments related to the effectiveness of vaccines”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is COVID-19 seasonal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01326-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01326-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Vaccination campaigns&lt;/a&gt; are focused on people over the age of 65 in the US, or 75 in the UK and parts of Europe, and those with a weakened immune system who are older than 6 months. Michael Head, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, UK, says he would prefer a wider vaccine roll-out for younger populations as well. “It’s still not a pleasant infection, and vaccines do still have a significant public-health benefit, so they are a vital tool in addressing the threat posed by COVID-19”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In 2006-2007, a ban on smoking in enclosed public places and workplaces was introduced and in 2015, a ban on smoking in cars with children was brought in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;More recently in 2017, plain cigarette packaging was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And government legislation currently progressing through parliament - called the Tobacco and Vapes Bill - will soon mean anyone born on or after 1 January 2009 will not be legally allowed to buy tobacco in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'Keep young people safe'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rules on how vapes are packaged and displayed in shops are also set to be tightened over concerns that the devices are appealing to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxyny0w7wdo" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;It has been illegal for businesses to sell or supply single-use or disposable vapes in the UK since June.&lt;/a&gt; The ban is aimed at reducing environmental damage and cutting the number of children and young people vaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The BBC understands the government will make it illegal to sell nicotine pouches and other nicotine products to under-18s as part of the Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told the BBC there were no limits on how strong these pouches can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"The Tobacco and Vapes Bill will let us set rules on nicotine strength, flavours and packaging to keep young people safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The ONS survey suggests 6.7% of people aged 16 and over in Great Britain use a vape or e-cigarette every day, up from 5.9% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Another 3.3% say they use one occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This equates to 5.4 million current vape users, a rise from 5.1 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The use of e-cigarettes daily or occasionally remained highest among 16-24 year olds in Great Britain in 2024 at 13%, down from 15.8% in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Hazel Cheeseman, chief executive of ASH, said there were still concerns about non-smokers and young people taking up vaping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 13:15:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1ZZUdGbFl4bnViTXdOSmxfNVVPSE5TVU1oWnlOa1V2MHlEWWljb0RSMEt2X1NMSlRGUDlRR3NEbUtYajZrMk5ET2JKc2sxWEN1anh3ZzNyM3Yxd9IBX0FVX3lxTE9fOXVyTzRYdmVtTkxOX1JCOVRKXzJSUU9vaVRXU1JHanhvdUUxMjZESVc5V3cxazR5Tmo0elp4SjFJaG5rNGFhWS1oV2tYX1RTcFNQTmtXMHBoVWcwakVV</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，您的麸质敏感性可能完全是另一回事- Daily Maverick</title><link>https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2025-11-04-your-gluten-sensitivity-might-be-something-else-entirely-new-study-shows/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=" mode-content article-content "&gt;
                                                                    &lt;h2 class="first-paragraph"&gt;By examining decades of research, we found that for most people who think they react to gluten, gluten itself is rarely the cause.&lt;/h2&gt;
                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Social media and lifestyle magazines have turned gluten – a protein in wheat, rye and barley – into a dietary villain. &lt;a href="https://www.olympics.com/en/news/novak-djokovic-gluten-free-diet"&gt;Athletes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/food/pictures/celebrities-who-follow-gluten-free-diets/"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt; have promoted gluten-free eating as the secret to better health and performance. But our recent &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01533-8/abstract"&gt;review in The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; challenges that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptoms but not coeliac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coeliac disease is when the body’s immune system attacks itself when someone eats gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the gut. But people with gut or other symptoms after eating foods containing gluten can test &lt;em&gt;negative&lt;/em&gt; for coeliac disease or wheat allergy. They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were “gluten sensitive” reacted equally – or more strongly – to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn’t have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests most people who feel unwell after eating gluten are sensitive to something else. This could be FODMAPs such as fructans, or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="in-article-action-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people’s symptoms. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo. This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations. These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn’t mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our wellbeing. People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential. But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there’s no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimise the quality of someone’s overall diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured re-introduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn’t explain someone’s symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That’s because expectation, stress and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic “gluten is bad” narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care. &lt;strong&gt;DM&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford University has unveiled a ureteroscopy-compatible device that magnetizes and retrieves kidney stone fragments with a wire, with performance in a pig model beating traditional removal techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Kidney stone disease affects around 11% of the US population and often requires ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy. Fragment removal after lithotripsy remains inefficient, leaving many patients with residual pieces that can trigger pain, infection, repeat procedures, and added costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stones form from crystallized salts that can then obstruct the thin tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder, causing pain, infection, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney+injury/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney injury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ureteroscopic laser lithotripsy remains the most common procedure. An endoscope enters through the urethra to the upper urinary tract, a laser fiber breaks stones into fragments under saline irrigation, and surgeons then aim for removal or spontaneous passage of small pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residual fragments persist in up to 40% of patients after ureteroscopy, driving complications that range from emergency visits to repeat interventions. Risk accumulates with time, as 30% of patients with any residual fragments required another operation within five years, compared with 4% among those with no residual pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Care demands are substantial, with more than 1.3 million emergency visits and more than $4 billion in annual expenditures in the US. Coupled with rising obesity and diabetes, major risk factors for formation, kidney stones are estimated to add another $1.2 billion per year in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+care+costs/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health care costs&lt;/a&gt; by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Magnetic retrieval of kidney stones via ureteroscopy in a porcine model," &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/device/fulltext/S2666-9986(25)00284-4" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Device&lt;/i&gt;, researchers engineered a ureteroscopy-compatible system to magnetize stone fragments with a hydrogel and retrieve them using a magnetic wire under direct endoscopic visualization in pigs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Experimental setups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instruments mirrored those used in clinical ureteroscopy with some controlled optimization. A 3D-printed kidney model was positioned in a 0.9% saline bath. Human-derived &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney+stone/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney stone&lt;/a&gt; fragments were positioned in the model kidney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hydrogel precursors, ferumoxytol and chitosan, were co-delivered through the dual-lumen injector so they contacted on the fragment surface and formed the magnetic hydrogel in situ, after which the magnetic wire attempted retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pig kidneys received retrograde placement of human-derived calcium oxalate fragments under 3 mm, magnetic hydrogel was delivered onto the fragments, and the magnetic wire attempted retrieval. Control kidneys underwent fragment placement and basket retrieval only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survival experiments used three pigs. One kidney per animal received magnetic hydrogel with endoscopic confirmation of gel formation, and the contralateral kidney remained untreated as a control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3D-printed kidney results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchtop optimization identified an initial density mismatch between ferumoxytol and chitosan in saline. Addition of glycerol to the chitosan precursor matched densities and increased magnetic labeling of 1–2 mm calcium oxalate fragments by four-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ureteroscopy runs demonstrated multi-fragment removal after a single hydrogel application. A total of 28 fragments sized 1–2 mm were removed in six passes following approximately 100 μL ferumoxytol and 200 μL chitosan delivered through the injector.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Performance in pigs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-week survival experiments recorded uneventful stone-free recovery with normal urination. Urinalysis and bloodwork remained within normal ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrigation alone cleared about 70% of the instilled gel. Combined magnetic retrieval and irrigation cleared 99.8% of the gel within 10 minutes. Magnetic particle imaging of urine, blood, kidneys, ureters, bladder, and selected organs at one week showed signals below the detection limit, supporting complete elimination of the hydrogel by that time point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future research plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors conclude that a magnetize-and-retrieve strategy is feasible and compatible with clinical ureteroscopes in a porcine model, with a favorable short-term safety profile and demonstrable pathways for intraoperative removal and physiologic clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future plans include head-to-head testing in a ureteroscopy model, hydrogel formulation refinement toward simplified dosing ratios, catheter improvements, and exploration of alternate magnetic geometries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful translation to a clinical method could raise stone-free elimination rates, reduce patient adverse outcomes and lower health care burdens.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Mental sharpness after 70 has less to do with genetics and more to do with how you use your brain daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother is 76 and runs intellectual circles around people decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She remembers details from conversations months ago. She learns new technology faster than my teenage cousins. She reads complex books and discusses them with nuance and insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she's not exceptional because of genetics or luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's sharp because of how she lives. The habits she's maintained for decades. The ways she challenges her brain consistently without making it feel like work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 share these habits. They're not doing elaborate brain training programs or expensive interventions. They're living in ways that naturally maintain and even improve cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are seven things that people over 70 who are sharper than most 40-year-olds consistently do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They read daily and discuss what they've read&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 read regularly. Not just scanning headlines or social media, but actual sustained reading. Books, long articles, material that requires focus and comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reading alone doesn't create the sharpness. It's the discussion afterward that matters. They talk about what they've read with friends, family, or book clubs. They process the information actively by articulating thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination exercises multiple cognitive skills. Focus and concentration during reading. Memory recall when discussing it later. Critical thinking when forming opinions. Verbal articulation when explaining ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who read but never discuss what they've read get fewer cognitive benefits. The active processing through conversation is where much of the mental exercise happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They maintain meaningful social connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolation is terrible for cognitive health. The sharpest people over 70 maintain active social lives with regular, substantive interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't surface-level connections. They're friendships where real conversations happen. Where ideas are exchanged. Where people challenge each other intellectually while maintaining warmth and connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social interaction exercises your brain in ways that solo activities can't. You're reading social cues, responding appropriately, following conversation threads, remembering context about people's lives. All of this keeps cognitive pathways active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who isolate after retirement often show faster cognitive decline. The brain needs social stimulation to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They keep learning new skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 don't stop learning. They take classes, learn instruments, pick up new hobbies, master new technologies. They challenge their brains with genuinely new information and skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from doing the same crossword puzzle every day. Novel learning creates new neural pathways. It forces your brain to work in unfamiliar ways. That struggle is what maintains cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother learned Spanish at 68. She takes online courses on topics that interest her. She learned to use a smartphone and tablet without help. Each new skill challenges her brain and proves to herself that she's still capable of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific skill matters less than the act of learning something genuinely new. The discomfort of being a beginner is actually beneficial. It signals to your brain that it needs to stay plastic and adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They stay physically active in consistent ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical movement affects cognitive function more than most people realize. Sharp people over 70 move their bodies regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily intense exercise. Just consistent movement. Walking, swimming, yoga, gardening. Activities that get blood flowing and keep the body functional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical activity increases blood flow to the brain. It supports the growth of new brain cells. It helps manage the inflammation that can contribute to cognitive decline. And it maintains the body-brain connection that's crucial for overall function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People over 70 who become sedentary often show faster mental decline. The body and brain are connected. Taking care of one supports the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They challenge themselves with complex mental tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp people over 70 don't avoid difficult thinking. They seek it out. They do things that require concentration, problem-solving, and mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be strategy games, complex puzzles, learning new recipes, planning trips, managing finances, writing. Whatever requires genuine cognitive effort rather than passive consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that these tasks stretch their abilities without becoming so frustrating they give up. They find the sweet spot where the challenge is real but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother does the New York Times crossword puzzle, but she also plans elaborate meals from scratch, manages her investments, and writes long letters to friends. All of these require focus, memory, planning, and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who default to passive activities like watching TV exclusively miss this cognitive stimulation. Your brain needs to be challenged regularly to stay sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain curiosity about the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 haven't lost their curiosity. They still want to understand how things work, why things happen, what's new and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They ask questions. They look things up. They explore ideas. They stay engaged with current events and new developments. Their minds remain active and interested rather than settling into fixed patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curiosity drives many of the other habits. It's why they read. Why they take classes. Why they have substantive conversations. The curiosity itself is what keeps them mentally engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who lose curiosity often lose mental sharpness. When you stop caring about understanding new things, your brain has less reason to stay engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They get quality sleep consistently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This habit is less obvious but critically important. Sharp people over 70 prioritize sleep and have consistent sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is when your brain consolidates memories, clears waste products, and repairs itself. Chronic poor sleep accelerates cognitive decline. Quality sleep protects against it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go to bed and wake at consistent times. They've created sleep environments that support rest. They don't sacrifice sleep for entertainment or out of habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people let sleep habits deteriorate as they age. They stay up late watching TV because they have no schedule to keep. They nap irregularly, disrupting nighttime sleep. Poor sleep patterns contribute significantly to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why these habits compound&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These seven habits work together. Physical activity supports better sleep. Social connections drive curiosity. Learning new things provides conversation topics. Reading fuels discussion. It's all interconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the effects compound over time. Someone who's done these things for decades has protected and strengthened their cognitive function in ways that become obvious by 70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is it's never too late to start. While maintaining these habits from midlife forward is ideal, adopting them at any age provides benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother didn't always do all these things. She developed many of these habits after retirement when she realized she needed structure and purpose. But decades of consistency has kept her mind remarkably sharp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest people over 70 aren't just lucky with genetics. They're people who've lived in ways that support cognitive health. They've stayed engaged, curious, social, and active. They've challenged their brains regularly. They've taken care of their bodies and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these habits require money or special circumstances. They're accessible to anyone willing to prioritize them. The challenge is consistency. Doing them not occasionally but as regular parts of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 70 and still doing these seven things, your mind is likely sharper than most people decades younger. Not because you're exceptional, but because you've maintained habits that support cognitive function while many others have let those habits slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're not over 70 yet, these habits are worth adopting now. The earlier you start, the more you benefit. But even starting later provides protection and improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental sharpness after 70 is largely within your control. It's the result of how you live, how you use your brain, and what you prioritize. These seven habits are the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Ever worried that skipping breakfast might leave you foggy at work? Or that intermittent fasting would make you irritable, distracted and less productive?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snack food ads warn us that "you're not you when you're hungry", reinforcing a common belief that eating is essential to keep our brains sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This message is deeply woven into our culture. We're told constant fuelling is the secret to staying alert and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/edrv/article/43/2/405/6371193"&gt;time-restricted eating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMra1905136"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt; have become hugely popular wellness practices over the past decade. Millions do it for long-term benefits, from weight management to improved metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/which-junk-foods-are-worst-for-brain-health"&gt;The Junk Foods That Harm Your Brain Most, Ranked by New Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises a pressing question: can we reap the health rewards of fasting without sacrificing our mental edge? To find out, we conducted the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000492"&gt;most comprehensive review to date&lt;/a&gt; of how fasting affects cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why fast in the first place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting isn't just a trendy diet hack. It taps into a biological system honed over millennia to help humans cope with scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we eat regularly, the brain runs mostly on glucose, stored in the body as glycogen. But after about 12 hours without food, those glycogen stores dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, the body performs a clever &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01254-5"&gt;metabolic switch&lt;/a&gt;: it begins breaking down fat into ketone bodies (for example, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate), which provide an alternative fuel source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This metabolic flexibility, once crucial for our ancestors' survival, is now being linked to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5783752/"&gt;host of health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180035" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock-.jpg" alt="Vegetables on one quarter of a plate, with a clock on the opposite quarter" class="size-full wp-image-180035" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock-.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Vegetables-on-plate-with-clock--600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180035" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Time-restricted eating and intermittent fasting have become hugely popular wellness practices over the past decade. (IvanSpasic/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the most promising effects of fasting come from the way it reshapes processes inside the body. For instance, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy"&gt;fasting activates autophagy&lt;/a&gt;, a kind of cellular "cleanup crew" that clears away damaged components and recycles them, a process thought to support healthier ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also improves &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance"&gt;insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the body to manage blood sugar more effectively and lowering the risk of conditions such as type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="180027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, the metabolic shifts triggered by fasting appear to offer broader protection, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-020-00013-3"&gt;helping reduce the likelihood&lt;/a&gt; of developing chronic diseases often associated with overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the data showed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These physiological benefits have made fasting attractive. But many hesitate to adopt it out of fear their mental performance will plummet without a steady supply of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this, we conducted a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="180027" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, a "study of studies", looking at all the available experimental research that compared people's cognitive performance when they were fasting versus when they were fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our search identified 63 scientific articles, representing 71 independent studies, with a combined sample of 3,484 participants tested on 222 different measures of cognition. The research spanned nearly seven decades, from 1958 to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After pooling the data, our conclusion was clear: there was no meaningful difference in cognitive performance between fasted and satiated healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People performed just as well on cognitive tests measuring attention, memory and executive function whether they had eaten recently or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When fasting does matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our analysis did reveal three important factors that can change how fasting affects your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, age is key. Adults showed no measurable decline in mental performance when fasting. But children and adolescents did worse on tests when they skipped meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their developing brains seem more sensitive to fluctuations in energy supply. This reinforces longstanding advice: kids should go to school with a proper breakfast to support learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing also seems to make a difference. We found longer fasts were associated with a smaller performance gap between fasted and fed states. This might be due to the metabolic switch to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/25177-ketones"&gt;ketones&lt;/a&gt;, which can restore a steady supply of energy to the brain as glucose runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance in fasted individuals tended to be worse when tests were conducted later in the day, suggesting fasting might amplify the natural dips in our circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of test also mattered. When cognitive tasks involved neutral symbols or shapes, fasting participants performed just as well, or sometimes even slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when tasks included food-related cues, fasted participants slipped. Hunger doesn't create universal brain fog, but it does make us more easily distracted when food is on our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, the findings offer reassurance: you can explore intermittent fasting or other fasting protocols without worrying that your mental sharpness will vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, fasting isn't a one-size-fits-all practice. Caution is warranted with children and teens, whose brains are still developing and who appear to need regular meals to perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if your job requires peak alertness late in the day, or if you're frequently exposed to tempting food cues, fasting might feel harder to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, for certain groups, such as those with medical conditions or special dietary needs, fasting may not be advisable without professional guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, fasting is best seen as a personal tool rather than a universal prescription. And its benefits and challenges will look different from person to person.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264019/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

I've heard that the results that essentially stopped HRT for decades were flawed in their interpretation. Is this correct? If so, are there new recommendations for women to start HRT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I am a 63-year-old female in excellent health and am trying to research the topic before my next doctor's appointment in a couple of months. I am also concerned that my own doctor may not have the appropriate training to prescribe HRT, as I've heard there is a whole generation of doctors who have not been trained in prescribing hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— B.H.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear B.H.:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn't say the studies (primarily the Women's Health Initiative but several others) were flawed so much; their interpretation needs to include the age of subjects in the study and the intervention given, particularly the choice and dose of both the estrogen and progestin. (In women with a uterus, a progestin must be given to reduce the risk of uterine cancer that is associated with estrogen therapy alone.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I do agree with you that HRT is probably underused as the most effective treatment of many symptoms of menopause. The mean age of women starting HRT in the WHI was 63, exactly your age as it turns out. In this group, there was a significant increase in the risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A careful reinterpretation of the data suggested that younger women (aged 50-59 or those within 10 years of stopping their periods) probably had no excess risk of heart disease and may have had a reduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Estrogen has beneficial effects on cholesterol and on the lining of the blood vessels, but it also increases blood-clotting risk (when given by mouth). So, estrogen may prevent blockages but also make an existing blockage develop a clot, which is the essential step in a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The current estrogen that is most commonly used by experts (estradiol, the bioidentical major human estrogen) and the current most frequently used progestin (micronized progesterone, also a bioidentical hormone) have less risk of causing cancer than the types used in most studies (conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone). Some studies have shown a reduced risk of breast cancer in estrogen-only regimens, while others have still shown an increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The blood-clotting risk is a significant consideration, with all oral estrogens increasing risk. Women who used an estrogen patch had no significant increase in clotting risk. In my opinion, the benefits of HRT in symptomatic women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause may outweigh the risks, but the decision still needs to be made after a careful discussion of risks and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I do not recommend initiating HRT in women who are both over 60 and are more than 10 years postmenopausal due to the increased risk of heart disease and stroke. I do not start HRT in asymptomatic women just to prevent disease. Further studies are required before I would change my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are still other considerations (benefits in reducing colon cancer and fractures with HRT; a possible small harm in other cancers; no clear benefit in preventing dementia; and a reduction in the rate of new diabetes cases) that are appropriate in some women who have particular health concerns or family histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;All general gynecologists as well as many primary care doctors in family and internal medicine are trained in HRT and should know the latest data.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:03:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxNbF9yMDdrM3QydzVFdnJYMlBiU1piajZQVVlwYWRucGZKUjA3cmFtZUJaQnplNWZYa010SzlOT3JlMWM1TUNWQkluaWxXVjNmSkZlN1EyYkpJX3k0enFjZkwwWFFIWmlQRVZrZFZhMDNjejRjVFFhblp1MWxZc2ZLSU1fTnBZRS15RTI0Yk5EbG1obHhXUGIySF9ldlhGeHd3c3d0d1VEcU9meG4xdVFKWUY0T0VZT3BMZkRxUkI4TGZCWUxQZks2RFBJYWNXTWc</guid></item><item><title>醒来尿尿是否正常？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/well/nocturia-bathroom-night-sleep.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:00:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5VaUJRYmJSNXhwQUtUSkprdW8xNE4xU2pTV1BCa21aUlZzb1ptdUhMeDdtM01PbGs1NHZWUXB5ZEllS0FydnpXWFd4SEp4anpQSDgzRFZIa2tuVUk1V2dQUGJtWWhYNnJpZnp5em0zdExXVTFrcmhIel85QUVPSjg</guid></item><item><title>这种鲜为人知的饮食实际上可以降低胆固醇-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/04/well/eat/health-benefits-portfolio-diet-cholesterol.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 10:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxOR1R2aDZ0eGdEakRIMVpsU00zSmpDbldGU3laelM1V2pmdjlYOFJVZXEzVy1PTVJVbUZLX2VXMWxuZkc1Q2wxaWU1OVEtblNDTGVWMzc3TzlOVE8tY205UXBMYnNuNkhXbXpHak1zYUJ6QXJjR2ZFbGZ0Qy1sNVJHc0RrbkhHVUNXVU5EWkJUMkdlRmkyOXc</guid></item><item><title>婴儿的第一次大便可以告诉你他们未来的健康状况- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20251103-what-a-babys-first-poo-can-tell-you-about-their-future-health</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;By day seven, vaginally-born babies tended to have either &lt;i id="b.longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.longum&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i id="b.brevae" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.brevae&lt;/i&gt; in their digestive tracts, while babies born via C-section were more likely to be &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1560-1" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;colonised by &lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The gut microbiome of vaginally born babies tended to match that of their mothers, confirming that bacteria are passed mostly from the mother's gut, not her vagina. Meanwhile, babies born via C-section had more bacteria associated with hospital environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"&lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; is a bacteria that's associated with opportunistic infection. So if your immune system is not working very well, it can cause disease," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers found the differences in gut bacteria between vaginally-born and caesarean-delivered babies largely evened out by the time the infant turned one. However, there were signs that having good bacteria from day one gave babies a health advantage. The team tracked over 1,000 of the babies to see if any were admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We were able to see that babies whose guts were dominated by &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; were about &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(24)00340-9/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;half as likely&lt;/a&gt; to be admitted for a respiratory tract infection within the first two years of life, when compared to the &lt;i id="b.-brevae" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. brevae&lt;/i&gt; babies and the &lt;i id="e.-faecalis" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;E. faecalis&lt;/i&gt; babies," says Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In other words, having &lt;i id="b.-longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B. longum&lt;/i&gt; seemed to protect some vaginally-born infants from respiratory conditions. It's possible that the absence of beneficial gut bacteria like &lt;i id="b.longum" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;B.longum&lt;/i&gt; could explain why babies born via C-section have a slightly &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(24)00645-7/abstract" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;elevated risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing certain inflammatory conditions such as asthma, allergies, autoimmune disorders and obesity, although more work is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:58:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQYm5BWS1rbUo3OXR5SnVNd2FWZ2ZPZzBfUUk4Y0l1U3hnd0tBSDRDbTVkbm00Y0g2bEJNSEJOOTZndmdmVzFzQUtNVkhuRnhtVko1bVR1M0JGcHE2WjZLdjI2a1E3WG1xZlVEdG5SRUtrcEdIMFZDMndRMl9tWndvN1JkSDJLWE1TbjQtMFRtbV9PUmdlRlRJVVVRZFpBU2JLa0dFRUFhQVo</guid></item><item><title>我是一名研究记忆操纵的神经科学家。我的工作帮助我从成瘾中恢复过来- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/11/04/addiction-brain-healing-choice-neuroscience/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When philosophers imagined the &lt;a href="https://open.library.okstate.edu/introphilosophy/chapter/ship-of-theseus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ship of Theseus&lt;/a&gt;, they asked: Can a vessel that has all its planks replaced one by one over time as it sails uncharted waters still be considered the same ship?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience offers a fascinating answer to this conundrum: yes — and not quite. The brain is rebuilt in much the same way, plank by plank, neuron by neuron. Cells are born and die, synapses rewire, and entire populations of neurons drift in and out of activity, even as our sense of self seems to sail on undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For me, this isn’t just an abstract metaphor for how the brain works. It’s the reality I’ve lived through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I study memory at Boston University, where my lab investigates how specific networks of brain cells encode, store, and even rewrite memories. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14514" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, that artificially activating positive memories in mice can buffer against stress and depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But my most personal experiment came when alcohol rewired my brain from within and quietly began rotting its most important planks. For about a decade, I spiraled, until I made the decision to channel my brain’s innate changeability not toward oblivion, but toward health, healing, and the possibility of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In biology, change isn’t optional — it’s the default setting. Nearly every cell in the body eventually turns over, and every memory we revisit reshapes its own neural circuitry. Memory is not a static recording; it’s a living reconstruction. That same plasticity that allows us to learn and adapt also leaves us vulnerable to patterns that hijack the system. Down to our DNA, biology is always in motion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But sometimes, the intersection of adversity and genetic predisposition creates the illusion of stasis. We become stuck and live inside the moments we’re trying to escape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addiction, at its core, is memory’s dark side: an overlearned association between relief and a substance, rehearsed until it becomes automatic. I learned this the hard way. After the sudden death of my dear friend and lab partner, Xu Liu, I pressed forward in the lab, driven by a need to preserve his legacy through the science we loved.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But underneath the progress, grief and exhaustion began to carve new paths in my brain. What started as a nightly drink to soften the edges turned into a ritual of escape. Then, it turned into something I couldn’t live without. I’d wake up at 3 a.m. and &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to take double shots of liquor, for instance, just to fend off the physical and mental torment that withdrawals bring with them. The same scientist who studied memory manipulation found himself manipulated by memory — seeking oblivion to avoid reliving loss, and refusing to face the full weight of the finality inherent to death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my oldest friends and my wife staged an informal intervention. The ship that was me, creaking under the weight of silence and grief, wasn’t going to capsize on their watch. Their message was simple and unshakable: connection, not control, is what saves you. I joined the Recovery Elevator Café RE community, which is an alternative to AA without any presumed religious affiliation, and it was there that I first internalized a phrase that now anchors both my work and my life: &lt;em&gt;The opposite of addiction is connection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just an emotional breakthrough. It was a neurobiological one. Positive social interaction floods the brain with chemicals like oxytocin and dopamine, which aren’t just feel-good modulators in the brain; they’re molecular glue that helps form new neural links. Healing, like memory, is a relational act: Neurons that fire together wire together — and people who are present for one another become presents for one another. In recovery, connection became my new experiment. I began retraining my brain to extract reward from conversation, from movement, from simply being here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sobriety didn’t restore the old version of me; it allowed me to build a new one from the driftwood of the past. Just like the ship of Theseus, recovery is an iterative reconstruction. I suspect that the neurons that once fired when I reached for a drink now activate when I reach for conversation, exercise, or moments of gratitude. In this sense, biology doesn’t erase. It repurposes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Some of the hardest memories I carry have become the most instructive. The darkest among them center on the handful of nights where I nearly drank myself to death. Yet today, I no longer feel shame. Those memories have changed — from raw grief to a deep, sustaining gratitude that the same neuroplasticity that once fueled my addiction also powered my recovery. In scientific terms, the physical underpinnings of memory, the &lt;em&gt;engram,&lt;/em&gt; has been updated. In human terms, it’s through updating what these memories mean to me that I’ve found a sort of internal redemption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This personal shift parallels what we observe in the lab. When we activate positive memories in mice, their stress responses &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5583720/pdf/nihms898575.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diminish&lt;/a&gt;; their brains literally &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13725" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;re-route emotional traffic&lt;/a&gt;. In humans, therapy and mindfulness work similarly by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31482135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;re-contextualizing painful memories&lt;/a&gt; until they begin to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26906-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;soften their emotional sting&lt;/a&gt;. Neural ensembles that once encoded fear are gradually replaced or quieted by those representing the present. Biology calls this representational drift. I’ve come to believe life calls it healing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That principle — using good memories as antidotes — guides both my research and my recovery. Every week, I ask students, fellow people in recovery, or readers to recall moments that remind them of who they are at their best. Each recollection lays down a new plank on the ship of Theseus. Over time, the vessel becomes strong enough to carry grief without capsizing under it. I do this because addiction isolates, but recovery reconnects. At Café RE, sharing stories of relapse and redemption helped rewire my shame into empathy. &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=MzOpDwAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PT9&amp;amp;dq=opposite+of+addiction+is+connection&amp;amp;ots=PBWIW8lp_x&amp;amp;sig=QOAcZKyUDQWLep_4N12nH1lkiLw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=opposite%20of%20addiction%20is%20connection&amp;amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social connection&lt;/a&gt; here isn’t just therapeutic — it’s literally chemical. It boosts serotonin, steadies cortisol, and restores activity in areas of the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33177112/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; like prefrontal cortex, the brain’s control center. The very systems that addiction hijacks can, with community, be recruited for resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to think of recovery as a single turning point, a before-and-after moment. But the brain reminds us it’s a continual process. Sobriety isn’t a finish line. It’s an ongoing act of remembering differently, of choosing, again and again, which version of ourselves we want to reinforce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When people hear that my lab can “create and delete” memories in rodents, they picture some sci-fi mind wipe. But the reality is subtler and more hopeful. Memory manipulation isn’t about erasure. It’s about reshaping emotional tone and what experiences mean to us. We can quiet the fear tied to a traumatic memory without deleting the event itself. Therapy works the same way: reframing a painful story while honoring its truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s what I did with my own past. Xu’s death, once too painful to bear, now feels like a lesson plan for love, loyalty, and purpose. The nights I nearly died drinking have become a reference point for gratitude. My memories didn’t vanish. They evolved. And in changing them, I changed myself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neuroscience has a name for this: post-traumatic growth. It’s the measurable increase in empathy, gratitude, and meaning that can follow crisis. Brains that survive trauma often emerge more connected, more flexible. It’s not inevitable, but it’s possible — and biology shows us how. Change at the synaptic level supports change at the personal one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That truth is humbling — and empowering. The same brain that built addiction also built my recovery. The same plasticity that encoded fear also encodes courage. We are all, quite literally, wired for renewal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m still learning to live with change. But now, I embrace it. The question isn’t whether we change — it’s &lt;em&gt;what we change for.&lt;/em&gt; Nature changes by default. But progress? That takes direction. For me, the direction is clear: connection, discovery, service. Mentoring young scientists. Supporting others in recovery. Turning grief into fuel for compassion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ship of Theseus isn’t a philosophical puzzle. It’s a permission slip that says we are allowed to be rebuilt. Whether we’re recovering from trauma, loss, or addiction, every new plank is a testament to our resilience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biology gave us a mutable brain. Memory gives us the ability to steer it. Change is the cost of staying alive — and the gift that lets us become something better.&lt;/p&gt;

It transformed the lives of millions of people. People who could barely rise from a chair could stand, walk, and work again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The late Robin Williams famously &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1885331/#:~:text=Sacks's%20book%20Awakenings%20is%20a,and%20spread%20across%20the%20world." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;brought the drug’s promise into public view&lt;/a&gt; in the 1990 movie “Awakenings.” For more than half a century, levodopa has been the gold standard for treating Parkinson’s disease, and the treatment is taught to medical students worldwide. Yet in 2025, most of the world’s 11.8 million people with Parkinson’s cannot reliably get it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let that sink in. A generic, off-patent medication that costs pennies a dose — one that can restore dignity, mobility, and independence — is out of reach for many people who need it. This is not because we lack the science. It’s because we lack the will, the systems, and the plan. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve solved harder problems. Two decades ago, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating the developing world. Lifesaving antiretroviral drugs existed but were locked behind high prices and weak global distribution. Through international coordination, policy changes, and sustained advocacy, we made those drugs available worldwide. Today, more than 29 million people are receiving treatment for HIV, turning what was once a death sentence into a livable and manageable condition. The hope is that the already implemented global systems and policies will sustain this success even with a decrease in funding from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why can’t we do the same for Parkinson’s disease? &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The barriers are depressingly familiar. In many low- and middle-income countries, levodopa is not on the shelves, or when it is, the supply is unreliable. Patients travel hours to reach a pharmacy, only to be told it’s out of stock. Counterfeit or substandard pills flood unregulated markets, leaving desperate families with medicines that don’t work. And when the drug is available, the cost can be crushing, forcing patients to choose between food and movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a supply chain problem. It’s a political and a moral failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s is the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease in the world. Its prevalence &lt;a href="https://pdplan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has doubled in the past 25 years and is set to double again&lt;/a&gt;. Yet unlike HIV or malaria, there is no coordinated global response. No multinational funding mechanism. No U.N. target. No accountability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we lay out exactly what such a response should look like: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make levodopa universally available and affordable.&lt;/strong&gt; Every country should add the drug to its essential medicines list, procure it in bulk at negotiated prices, and ensure consistent supply to all regions, rural and urban alike.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen distribution systems.&lt;/strong&gt; Governments and nongovernmental organizations must work with private suppliers to create reliable pipelines. That means better forecasting, secure storage, and safeguards against stockouts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure quality and safety.&lt;/strong&gt; Regulatory agencies must test and certify medications to block counterfeits and substandard batches. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate health workers and communities.&lt;/strong&gt; Many patients with Parkinson’s go untreated simply because no one recognizes their symptoms or knows levodopa can help. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor progress and hold leaders accountable.&lt;/strong&gt; We need transparent data on access, coverage, and outcomes, and the political will to act when targets aren’t met, just as we did with HIV.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The global HIV response showed what’s possible when science, policy, and activism align. We built systems to deliver daily pills to tens of millions, across every continent, and have done so for decades. If we can do that for complex HIV drug cocktails, surely we can do it for a shelf-stable, safe, and well-tolerated oral tablet like levodopa.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cost is trivial when compared to the benefit. The return is enormous: People who can walk to work, care for their families, and live without the indignity of an untreated disease. In purely economic terms, keeping people mobile reduces disability costs, caregiver burden, and lost productivity. In human terms, it restores lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are unnecessarily letting millions slip into disability. Imagine telling someone with HIV in the early 2000s that the drugs existed but it wasn’t worth it for society to deliver the medication to them. That is exactly the message we are sending to people with Parkinson’s today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a solvable problem, but solutions don’t happen by accident. We must demand them. We must push for levodopa access as a basic human right and add it to the global health agenda. We need to start now, before the wave of cases overwhelms strained health systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world once rallied to turn the tide of HIV. We can and must do the same for Parkinson’s disease. A pill that costs pennies should not be a luxury. And a life that can be restored should never be left to wither.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michael S. Okun and Ray Dorsey are authors of the new book, “The Parkinson’s Plan.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dorsey has worked as a consultant to companies that market levodopa formulations, but not on projects related to the drug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;

These treatments attack both cancer cells and healthy cells, exposing patients to serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A team of scientists from the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Porto in Portugal have just brought an alternative one step closer. They’ve developed materials capable of converting near-infrared light, or NIR, efficiently and safely into heat that can be highly targeted against cancer cells. Their materials are tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoflakes, tiny particles that have a thickness of less than 20 nanometers (a nanometer is one-thousand-millionth of a meter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The team’s findings, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.5c03135"&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/a&gt;, offer new hope for the design of photothermal therapies, the name given to these types of light-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A photothermal therapy is a noninvasive procedure that heats up cancer cells in order to destroy them. It works by infiltrating cancer cells with materials that absorb light and turn it into heat—in this case, the SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflakes—which can be designed so that they accumulate specifically in tumor tissues. They are then targeted with light at a wavelength that gives these materials the energy they need to produce cancer-killing heat but which doesn’t damage healthy tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The researchers propose that their SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflakes could improve these types of treatments by offering greater thermal efficiency, biocompatibility, and affordability than other materials that are used in such processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible,” said Jean Anne Incorvia, a UT professor of engineering and one of the project leaders, in a &lt;a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2025/10/09/led-light-blasts-cancer-cells-and-spares-healthy-ones/"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “With the combination of LED light and SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoflakes, we’ve developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To evaluate the thermal efficiency of their new material, the team developed a proprietary system based on near-infrared LEDs (NIR-LEDs) that emit light at a wavelength of 810 nanometers, which is safe for biological tissues. Unlike traditional laser systems, NIR-LEDs provide more homogeneous and stable illumination, reduce the risk of overheating, and require minimal investment. The entire experimental set-up, capable of irradiating up to 24 samples at the same time, cost approximately $530, making it an affordable and versatile tool for biomedical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Results from beaming NIR onto SnO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-treated cancer cells have been encouraging. UT reported that in as little as 30 minutes of exposure, the method killed up to 92 percent of skin cancer cells and 50 percent of colorectal cancer cells. This was achieved without any harmful effects to healthy skin cells, demonstrating the safety and selectivity of this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQTFVqcjBVUW9LcEtWODdyTUxSWU54U1p5RFZZcEJoUVY0LVJLVmxSVVVDVFBvSzdYNTA1NzBTMTZGUFp4NHBTZnpBZGc5VmhLTk1lRWxBekJBcng4Y0ZFZUdiYzRwMWxoZ0JvTUd0QUxRLVhoajA1N044ZWlJVHlUeTRwcjhLYlBhUk5IZWQ0MzUxdG4xeTRUYm83M211ckQ2QzZnbXh5Z1k</guid></item><item><title>顶级神经科学家建议进行3次锻炼，以自然“生长”新的脑细胞-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/top-neuroscientist-recommends-3-workouts-to-naturally-grow-new-brain-cells/articleshow/125082021.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping our brains young and healthy is just as important as keeping the body in shape. The good news: the brain does not need to be fixed; it can grow new cells and adapt throughout our lives, a process called neurogenesis. Neuroscientist Robert Lowe, who specializes in Alzheimer's treatment, explains that certain physical and mental exercises can stimulate the growth of new brain cells, helping to improve memory and overall cognitive function. Some of the most effective and science-backed workout options are resistance training, dual-task exercises and leg exercises. Let us look at each one by one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Resistance Training: Improves strength and brain power&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training includes various forms of exercises where muscles work against an external force, such as free weights, resistance bands, or body weight. Neuroscientific studies show that resistance training can boost BDNF levels, thus stimulating the birth of new neurons in critical brain areas, including the hippocampus hub of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 creative activities to boost brain power, sharpen memory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical resistance exercises include weight lifting, squats, lunges, push-ups, and resistance band workouts. With this form of exercise done consistently, muscles are not the only things being developed; cognitive function is also enhanced through increased neuroplasticity, or the ability of the brain to adapt and make new neural pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that even moderate resistance training, done two to three times a week, can produce remarkable positive effects in the brain's health and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, resistance training combats age-related muscle loss (sarcopenia) and supports mobility, therefore minimizing the risk of falls and brain injury that could impair cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dual-task exercises: Challenges mind and body simultaneously&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exercises that combine two of our senses: Physical and mental, both, meaning training the body and brain at the same time. These workouts require both concentration and coordination, which makes them particularly effective for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of multitasking specifically activates brain networks responsible for attention, coordination, and executive functions uniquely. Neuroscience research showed that these trainings, since they require an active involvement of multiple brain regions simultaneously, are more effective in enhancing neurogenesis compared to physical or cognitive training alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mental challenge with physical movement thus results in higher production of BDNF, stimulating synaptic plasticity and enhancing the development of strong neural networks that are necessary to enable advanced thinking and memory. Dual-task training is particularly effective in older adults in terms of delaying cognitive decline and enhancing functional independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leg Exercises: Big on brain benefits &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workouts that focus on legs such as squats, lunges, climbing stairs etc, are powerful for our brains. That is because they engage some of the most largest muscles of our body, when these muscles contract, they send strong biochemical signals to our brain, helping boost NDNF production and support the growth of new brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brisk walking or jogging, while famous for its cardiovascular benefits, also serves to increase blood flow to the brain, carrying oxygen and nutrients critical for the growth and repair of brain cells. Dr. Robert Lowe identifies leg exercises as a key component of his recommendations on brain wellness because they maximize systemic effects that are beneficial for brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides promoting brain development, exercises of the leg improve balance, coordination, and endurance-all of which indirectly contribute to brain health because they reduce injury risk and foster an active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to incorporate these exercises into our routines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists recommend the regular inclusion of all three types of exercises to maximize the growth of brain cells and cognitive benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance is recommended at least twice or thrice a week. These exercises include: squats, deadlifts, lunges etc&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice dual-task exercises daily or several times a week: Examples of those are balance poses, Rober Lowe personally recommends a fun way, like walking and talking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leg-focused exercises daily, including brisk walking, stair climbing, or squats that engage both muscular and cardiovascular activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such exercises do more than just build muscle and aid in strength.

said: "Thanks to this exciting new research, we've been able to get a closer insight into the lives of those who existed through such a notable chapter in our past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"As an ancient city, we have such a rich history and the discovery of a young male who may have died during the Black Death is a hugely significant find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've no doubt that we have so much left to uncover and our heritage and shared stories will be enhanced over time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 06:14:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"
