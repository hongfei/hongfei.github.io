&lt;p&gt;Lower back pain is a global epidemic with 619 million people suffering from this condition worldwide, according to an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(23)00133-9/fulltext" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt; journal. And by 2050, this number is set to reach 843 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If spending prolonged periods in one position has left you feeling stiff and achy, yoga instructor &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/nicolewood.yoga/" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/nicolewood.yoga/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Nicole Wood&lt;/a&gt;, a master trainer at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yogasix.com/" data-url="https://www.yogasix.com/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;YogaSix&lt;/a&gt;, says one move can help: standing forward fold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many poses that offer relief for low back pain," Wood explains. "Personally, I prefer a standing forward fold because that is what feels best in my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel that a forward fold offers a complete reset of my spine, and also helps to relax my neck and shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After a long day of sitting, and working at my desk, when I enter a forward fold, I feel relief through my backside body. I can feel the space between my vertebrae become more open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-movement"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the movement &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood recommends completing three to five repetitions of standing forward fold and holding the stretch for 30 seconds. The instructor advises doing the move when you wake up, after you’ve finished work, and before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can do this every day of the week," Wood explains. "There is no rule limiting how many forward folds one does, just be mindful with movement and breath."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-58XJRzaVDUXDpMv3LRscG5 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitions:&lt;/strong&gt; 3-5 &lt;strong&gt;Time:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in a mountain pose with your feet hip-width apart, arms by your side and your &lt;a href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;core engaged&lt;/a&gt;. Ground down through your feet to lengthen your spine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale and raise your arms overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhale, fold forward by hinging at the hips. Maintain a small bend your knees and lead the movement with your chest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Relax your hands and head towards the ground.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draw your navel in and up and engage your quads (front thigh muscles) and hip flexors (at the top of your legs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Move deeper into the stretch with every breath. Inhale, find length in your spine, exhale and fold deeper.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifications: &lt;/strong&gt;If your hands don’t reach the ground, place your hands on yoga blocks, or on your shins or hips. You may wish to bend your knees and bring your hands to your thighs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-doing-standing-forward-fold"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of doing standing forward fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing forward fold, or Uttanasana as it’s known in Sanskrit, is one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/yoga-stretches-for-beginners"&gt;best yoga poses for beginners&lt;/a&gt; for flexibility. But that’s not the only benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anytime you are folding forward in a yoga pose, there is a calming effect on the nervous system," Wood explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A standing forward fold also strengthens the thighs and knees, while stretching the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;hamstrings, calves, hips, glutes, shoulders, and soles of feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Folding forward also helps improve digestion. When the belly is folding over the thighs there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;is gentle stimulation to the digestive system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wood says forward fold can also help the spine stay strong and supple, supporting better posture.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A new study has identified a protein that appears to be essential for hair growth and hair follicle protection. Called MCL‑1, it could potentially be targeted by treatments for certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hair-loss-drug-approved-restores-80-of-hair-loss-in-some-alopecia-patients"&gt;kinds of baldness such as alopecia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from the Duke‑NUS Medical School in Singapore and the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Australia, researchers found that when MCL-1 production was blocked in mice, the animals lost their hair later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hair follicles go through cycles of quiescence and growth, with MCL-1 playing a critical role in the latter phase. The protein doesn't seem to affect the resting phase or the initial development of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle"&gt;hair follicles&lt;/a&gt;, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart.jpg" alt="Hair chart" class="wp-image-156731 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart-611x415.jpg 611w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/HairChart-600x407.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156731" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers studied the impact of MCL-1 on hair follicles in mice. (Chin et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Acute MCL‑1 deletion rapidly depletes activated hair follicle  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and completely blocks depilation‑induced hair regeneration in adult mice, while quiescent hair follicle stem cells remain unaffected," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cell-and-developmental-biology/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.704547/full"&gt;already known&lt;/a&gt; that MCL-1 played an important role in protecting a number of different kinds of tissue from apoptosis; the programmed death of redundant or damaged cells to keep the body functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to hair, MCL-1 prevents follicle stem cells from being stressed and damaged as they 'reawaken' from rest. Without MCL-1 to protect them, these cells stop functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team was also able to reveal new details on MCL-1's function, identifying ways it suppresses another protein called BAK and how MCL-1 is regulated by a signaling pathway called ERBB. These details could be useful in developing new methods of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-surprise-hair-loss-breakthrough-sugar-gel-triggers-robust-regrowth"&gt;hair loss treatments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest that ERBB signaling modulates MCL‑1 expression through translational control mechanisms, particularly during periods of heightened apoptosis and regression in the hair cycle," the researchers &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was based solely on mice, so while there's good reason to think the same processes are happening on the top of our own heads, the findings will need to be replicated in clinical research on humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also worth bearing in mind that there are several &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-hair-doesn-t-grow-on-wounded-skin-and-how-it-might-help-hair-loss-treatments"&gt;different kinds of alopecia&lt;/a&gt;, all with a variety of contributing causes: if treatments are one day developed that focus on boosting MCL-1, they're not going to work for all types of hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those limitations aside, this one protein's handiwork is a significant revelation concerning hair follicles' ability to grow hair. The findings could also inform future studies into other processes affected by MCL-1, including &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2023.1226289/full"&gt;cancer cell death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying hair follicle regeneration and offers new insights into how  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; survival and tissue regeneration are orchestrated," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings may have broader implications for controlling the survival of stem and progenitor cells in tissue regeneration and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="156728" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; expansion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58150-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Complications can include pneumonia and encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who was exposed and starts to develop symptoms should immediately call their doctor, an urgent care center or emergency department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases in the United States this year already have surpassed 2024 numbers, with outbreaks reported in at least five states. A &lt;a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/02/26/measles-outbreak-texas-death/"&gt;child in Texas died from measles&lt;/a&gt; in February, marking the first pediatric death since 2003. The last adult death from measles in the U.S. was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Texas &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-vaccine-rfk-d5444b3397ac7c4034e63becc219aa33"&gt;has grown to 400 cases&lt;/a&gt;. Other states with outbreaks — defined as three or more cases — include New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio and Oklahoma. Since February, two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new outbreaks confirm health experts’ fears that the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. The World Health Organization said this week cases in Mexico are linked to the Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is both extremely contagious and highly preventable with a vaccine, Colorado state epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The MMR vaccine provides excellent protection and helps prevent outbreaks like the one we are seeing globally,” she said. “We urge Coloradans to review their vaccination status and take steps to protect themselves, their families and their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine may also prevent infection if given within 72 hours of being exposed, according to state officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://myaccount.denverpost.com/dp/preference"&gt;Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say many of the estimated million people living with this condition are "ghosts in the system", whose lives are being torn apart by poorly managed extreme suicidal lows or manic, erratic highs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When she was 32 weeks pregnant, her grandmother died unexpectedly, sending her into a "deep low". "I felt awful, but the perinatal team wouldn't take me on," she says. "They said my symptoms weren't that serious." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;When Emma gave birth, the extreme lows of her pregnancy were replaced by an unexpected high. She felt amazing in the days after her baby was born - but she didn't sleep and her behaviour became increasingly erratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;A few weeks later, her mood flipped again. When her baby was three weeks old, Emma took an overdose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It took a week in hospital for her liver function to return. But even after that, she was in and out of hospital for a year before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and medicated correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If I had the correct care, and been listened to during my pregnancy or even earlier, I could have avoided taking that overdose - 100%," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It wasn't Emma's first experience of poor mental health - she'd spent her teens seeing doctors and receiving different antidepressants. No one had ever suggested she might have bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Emma was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her early 30s, after experiencing a mental health crisis&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Experts have told the BBC how most people living with bipolar disorder in the UK are "undertreated, undiagnosed and left to try and survive in a system that has failed them".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The majority who, like Emma, are eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder, are incorrectly prescribed antidepressants initially, which makes their symptoms worse rather than better. Experts also say there is a lack of continuity of care from GPs through to psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Their warning comes as data exclusively shared with the BBC suggests the cost of the condition in the UK is now an estimated £9.6bn a year. That equates to more than £300 per taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This breakdown includes NHS costs, such as GP services, psychiatrist appointments and visits to A&amp;amp;E and hospital admissions. It also includes economic costs, such as lost days at work and the need for family and friends to take time off to provide informal care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it does not include welfare payments for those out of work, or costs for police services dealing with people in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Highly treatable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"This nearly £10bn figure is actually quite conservative," says Prof Judit Simon, from the Medical University of Vienna, who worked with the BBC to generate the number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If this is a government that really wants to try and bring down the welfare bill, then bipolar disorder should be its absolute priority, the target disorder to actually move the dial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The data suggests up to 372,000 people with bipolar disorder are currently out of work and claiming benefits in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;For a treatable disease, this number could be slashed if the correct care was on offer, say experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Guy Goodwin, emeritus professor of psychiatry at University of Oxford, says: "If you want to cut the costs of a disease, you need to reduce hospital admissions and emergency care. If you don't focus on cutting hospital admissions then you waste money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;According to the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP), bipolar disorder is a manageable condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Trudi Seneviratne, registrar at the RCP and a commissioner on the Bipolar Commission, says it is "completely treatable" with a combination of medication, talking therapies and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But there are many, many people who are suffering in silence with lower levels of symptoms because there isn't a good clinical care pathway for them in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She says if care for bipolar disorder was fit for purpose, it would cut "the cost to society" as well as reducing "the human suffering this disease unnecessarily causes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is this sense of waste - with people who could be leading a good life but aren't - that angers experts most, who say it is a neglected diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Allan Young, from Imperial College, says: "Bipolar is common, complex and costly - but it is so often unrecognised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"People know it is there but somehow people are just not being cared for correctly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This lack of correct care is what Rosie says resulted in her being arrested at Stansted Airport for jumping the security barriers during a manic episode in her early 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was utterly delusional," she says. Following her arrest, Rosie was taken to A&amp;amp;E and locked in a room. She waited there for more than 12 hours while a bed at a specialist mental health unit was found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Like Emma, Rosie had been dealing with mental health issues since childhood, but it was only after being in crisis that her condition was recognised. This particular period of psychotic mania had been triggered by a relationship breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She was sectioned and hospitalised for three months, after which she finally began finding a combination of medications that worked for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Now 29, Rosie says she still has high and low periods, but adds that she is far more stable and is able to work part time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I was failed," she says. "I'm told my symptoms were a textbook case for bipolar lows and highs – energetic, grandiose language, erratic – but no one even considered this diagnosis for me until I was sectioned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Costs could be halved &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The Maudsley Hospital, in South London, has an intensive specialist care programme for its sickest, most regularly relapsing bipolar patients. The service aims to try and stop patients hitting crisis point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Similar to services offered in other European nations, the hospital provides group sessions for patients and their families. The classes help patients to understand when an episode might be starting and then contact the service once they spot early warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They can then attend an outpatient clinic and adjust medications. The relatively cheap programme has seen re-admission rates to hospital fall by 80% as intervention takes place before a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Young says costs associated with bipolar disorder could be halved with more specialist care programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Undoubtedly, specialist treatment could contribute to getting lots of people back into work. And we know that work is very good for helping people recover from episodes of mental ill health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, many experts say patients still face a postcode lottery about whether they can see a psychiatrist at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Carolyn Chew-Graham, a GP and professor of general practice research at Keele University, says those who are acutely unwell will be picked up quickly by crisis teams but those with "less florid manic episodes" can miss out on referral to specialists for diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"There's a high threshold of referral," Prof Chew Graham says. "People really have to be quite unwell before they are seen in specialist services". She says GPs may be reluctant to refer patients - even if they strongly suspect they have bipolar disorder - for fear they will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"GPs may think I won't even consider bipolar because if I mention it to the patient and then I can't get them seen, I am a bit stuck".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Young says bipolar patients need long-term specialist care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"But that's the frustration here - even though there is strong evidence that specialist care improves the outcomes for the patient, and costs the state less, there are still so few bipolar specialist facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It's a tragedy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;An NHS spokesperson said bipolar disorder could often take time to diagnose because it affected everyone differently and the symptoms were similar to other mental health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"NHS staff are working incredibly hard to get people diagnosed and reduce waiting times for care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Staff are treating a million more people than they were six years ago and are working to transform services alongside this demand – this includes strengthening community services, trialling new 24/7 open access mental health centres and rolling out mental health crisis lines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;If anything in this article makes you concerned please consult your GP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;&lt;i id="if-you've-been-affected-by-the-issues-in-this-story,-help-and-support-is-available-via" class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-action-line." class="sc-7dcfb11b-0 kKcaog"&gt;BBC Action Line.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jVHuOl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 01:18:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9IdWd3ajQ4SHhobHNzNGVKTF8tUGNia2FWRTJTZzR3MWpiZlVEbnRPdUd0OXFkRE14MHQ3blRJM3hWcXBMTGgwWGdPU1VGeTFVVU1xVjhBaEFHUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5pRjF4WnNFSkI4akpJQWFvSGpoYmloRWticzlfamFiS2UxV3l4MS1WTGdXSl93bmg0STh2N0xLdU5oaXNHZ0E1S0FMSnd1XzlFdFVLb3UwSDExNmlqazNj</guid></item><item><title>African Man Working In The U.S. Apologizes To Americans He Made Fun Of For Taking Mental Health Days - YourTango</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPTzZybHpHZTdsNzFfUkpINUpTWjhqSEhua0w1V3JmQUxJb0FIaGhFU1FUcnM5Q2hCVkNfcG96R05ISFZ5aVdwWlZXcVFYZklWZjZySHdlVnlMTV9fSUZHaUh2RnlmbGF1d1BWUTlrZUlsd3J5VEJsYUQzNGx6SUU5cGk2ZkhWUkt1R1owdW5aeW9xTkYyZk5sdndKZTRBblhoU1dJLQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corporate America is exhausting, and burnout is incredibly common. In fact, &lt;a href="https://moodle.com/us/news/ai-for-workplace-training-in-america/" rel="nofollow"&gt;2025 research from Moodle&lt;/a&gt; found that 66% of American employees are experiencing burnout, which is exactly why mental health days are so prevalent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it seems that those outside of this country don't quite understand the need for mental health days. One African man admitted that he fell into that camp. He didn't get why Americans needed to take time away from work to maintain their mental health — until he began working in the U.S. himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The African man working in the U.S. apologized to Americans he made fun of for taking mental health days.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a heartfelt admission, the Zambian man, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bigsam.14_two" rel="nofollow"&gt;known online as "Big Sam,"&lt;/a&gt; apologized to Americans he previously mocked for taking mental health days. He confessed that he used to think Americans complained a lot, but since moving to America and working in the country, he gained a new understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’ve been asking for some mental health days off," Sam said, laughing. "Like, I need some mental health time off. They were not lying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/burnout-red-flags-job-consuming-life"&gt;4 Burnout Red Flags Your Job Is Dangerously Consuming Your Whole Life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;America's 'hustle culture' is often exhausting. &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam quickly discovered that the constant "hustle culture" that American society promotes is unsustainable. Many corporate environments are fast-paced and come with high, often unreasonable, expectations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a competitive culture prominent in many U.S. workplaces. Employees may find themselves vying for promotions, raises, or opportunities to stand out. This competitive environment can drive high performance, but it also leads to stress and poor mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/workplace-stress" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports&lt;/a&gt; that approximately 83% of U.S. workers suffer from work-related stress, with 54% claiming that work stress affects their home life. Moreover, workplace stress has been reported to cause 120,000 deaths in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="player-wrapper-outer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/career/employees-under-30-lose-one-day-work-week-due-mental-health-issues"&gt;Prolonged stress and untreated mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; can lead to serious physical health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, and sleep disorders. By taking time for mental health, employees can avoid these long-term health complications, leading to better overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/asian-immigrant-defends-americans-stereotype-lazy"&gt;Asian Immigrant In The U.S. Defends Americans From The Stereotype That They Have Life On ‘Easy Mode’ — ‘Americans Are Not Lazy’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When done correctly, mental health days can be incredibly beneficial.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By taking time off in the form of a mental health day, you give your body a chance to recover, re-energize, and restore mental clarity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/recharge-with-planned-mental-health-day" rel="nofollow"&gt;Writing for the Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, Angela Theisen, L.C.S.W., discussed mental health days, defining them as "limited time away from your usual responsibilities with the intention of recharging and rejuvenating your mental health." She added, "It is an intentional act to alleviate distress and poor mood and motivation, while improving attitude, morale, functioning, efficiency, and overall well-being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theisen further noted that such days have a multitude of benefits, including reducing feelings of burnout, boosting morale, increasing resiliency, reducing mental health crises, and improving physical health. Somewhat counterintuitively, mental health days have also been &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/career/inconspicuous-reason-you-may-be-struggling-productivity-work"&gt;shown to improve productivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A mental health day is much more than just getting a latte and taking a nap. Or sleeping until noon and then &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/what-is-doomscrolling-how-to-stop"&gt;mindlessly scrolling through social media&lt;/a&gt; all afternoon. These are easy ways to waste away a day but not improve your mental health," Theisen cautioned. "Be intentional about the activities you do during a mental health day to get the full benefits and improve your health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested unplugging from social media, spending time outside, getting active, and doing something creative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/career/career-expert-shares-types-people-unlikely-make-it-corporate"&gt;Career Expert Shares The 4 Types Of People Who Are Unlikely To 'Make It' In A Corporate Environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sylvia Ojeda is an author who has over a decade of experience writing novels and screenplays.

          &lt;p&gt;My adult daughter gets a whopping $889 a month for SSD. She had to claim disability before ever being able to hold down a job after getting her Masters degree, in European Policies at Bath University, UK. She has a B.S. degree in Poly Sci and Spanish. She wanted to work in Europe at the EU. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter’s SSD diagnosis: OCD at 9 years old. Crohn’s disease (25” removed). Gastroparesis — paralyzed stomach. Those two did not allow her to work and we filed for SSD when she was 22. To get her approved at age 22 for SSD it took two years. Two denials and us hiring a lawyer. A judge finally approved her for SSD and she got a little over $700 to live on. She didn’t qualify for food stamps, etc. due to us making too much money at the time of filing and her living with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added diagnosis at later times: &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots" target="_blank" title=""&gt;POTS&lt;/a&gt; — Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Sinus Tachycardia. hypermobile Ehler’s Danlos Syndrome (hEDS); a connective tissue disorder. We think the hEDS skipped a generation or two to get to her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder that causes generalized joint hypermobility, joint instability, and chronic pain. hEDS is also associated with a variety of other symptoms and related conditions that affect many different areas of the body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many with hEDS are wheel chair bound but we are lucky that she is mobile and doesn’t need me to care for her in any way — yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cannot have over $1500 at any time in her bank account or she’s fined. In &lt;strong&gt;May, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, hubby forgot to pull out some of the funds so that the automatic deposit wouldn’t go over the $1500. Oooops. SS deposited her $860 and for two days she had over $1500 in her account by $27.00. She got a letter in July, 2024 stating that due to being over the amount in her account in May, she would have a deduction for those two months of over $100 from her next couple of SSD payments, to balance out the account. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s allowed one car. She sold the one she had and got an EV. (We’re trying to do our part here folks.) SS saw TWO CARS on her account. She had to call twice and give lots of documentation that &lt;u&gt;THEIR deposit&lt;/u&gt; caused the overage and she only had one car. Resolved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every five years she has to prove that she &lt;em&gt;continues to be disabled&lt;/em&gt;. One time, one asshole said she could use her arms so could work. She filed a complaint and, literally, 15 minutes before us driving an hour and a half to the main SS office in Modesto for the appointment, the agent there called and said he approved her SSD. The ups and downs this causes can be very difficult for her to deal with. She will be 40 years old this year and each year we watch her body slowly, very slowly, deteriorate. Many people with an episode with hEDS (she has had one with the sinus tachycardia) has a life expectancy of 45. We shall see.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My 74 year old husband is lucky to be able to work part-time, temporary for the City he worked with before. I also work full-time at 73 years old, as a professional long-arm quilter. We still get out PERS through our previous jobs and our social security by not overworking. We have worked hard for our SS and continue to work hard to support our daughter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We pay an extra $1800 a month for insurance for our daughter due to her seeing specialists at Stanford. We still pay cash to other medical folks that help her. Counseling, physical therapy, etc. We lay out between $3 — $4000 a month to care of her (car, medical, food, etc.) Due to her hEDS, she had no connective tissue in her left jaw and had to have major jaw surgery. We paid $67,000 out of pocket due to insurance saying it was elective! The misaligned jaw caused migraine headaches, face, jaw, shoulder, neck pain. Plus it had to be done to help her chew FFS. But insurance kept saying it was plastic surgery and elective. Insurance paid for anesthesia, hospital though. Thank you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can people perpetrate fraud in Social Security? Within two days they know if our daughter has over $1500 in her account! Then…..deduct funds after that until it’s “balanced.”   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just got a new letter today. Is it a form letter all SSD folks are getting? It states that she was notified “before” that there was an issue with her account and she was going to be discounted $121 a month. Not why? Not how long? Nothing. There was no notification before except last year and that was resolved. She will be contacting our local SS office, which for now, is still open for business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this part of the changes Musk is trying to put through? It’s already hard enough to get SSD for the small amount of support it affords our daughter.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is our current situation. The fight to get what we have paid for through our own hard work can sometimes be overwhelming. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks, we are all going to be impacted by this administration, negatively, in some way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="is-empty-p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;

A new study from Iraq and Iran found that &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a63785578/are-chia-seeds-really-healthy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chia seed consumption can lower blood pressure and cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chia seed consumption can lower blood pressure and cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, as well as possibly help prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But this connection between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6994964/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chia seeds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; and health is nothing new: These small-but-mighty seeds have long been touted for their nutritional benefits. One ounce (about 2 tablespoons) of chia seeds contains nearly 10 grams fiber and 5 grams protein, plus &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a64303162/study-omega3-fatty-acids-biolgical-age/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty&lt;/a&gt; acids, per the &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:United States Department of Agriculture.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven't really tried this superfood, now is the time to change that! This ingredient is easy to incorporate into recipes — and a little packs a big nutritional punch. That said, there are a few things to know before you start stirring this seed into anything and everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, the experts in the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen and Good Housekeeping Institute Nutrition Labs share their top tips for using these seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These small, oval-shaped seeds come from the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica &lt;/em&gt;plant, a member of the mint family. Native to Central and South America, these seeds have been cultivated for centuries and today can be found pretty much anywhere in the United States (Trader Joe's, Aldi, Amazon, you name it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chia seeds nutrition (1 ounce, dry), &lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per the;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;per the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/170554/nutrients" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:USDA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;140 calories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;9g total fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12g total carbohydrates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;10g dietary fiber&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;5g protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the best ways to eat chia seeds?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that when soaked, chia seeds absorb liquid and turn into a gel-like consistency. This will affect the texture of whatever you're stirring chia seeds into — whether that be smoothies, puddings, homemade jams or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stir it into oatmeal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because such a small amount packs such a nutritional punch, adding a spoonful of chia seeds into something you &lt;em&gt;already &lt;/em&gt;eat on the regular — like oatmeal — is a no-brainer. Food producer &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/254692/tina-martinez/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tina Martinez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tina Martinez&lt;/a&gt; always stirs 1 tablespoon of chia seeds into her oatmeal before heating in the microwave. “I love the consistency of just having some chia seeds, but not all chia seeds (as is the case of a chia pudding)." Not a fan of hot oatmeal? You can also mix chia seeds into overnight oats as you meal prep a few jars to stash in the fridge for the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Make a chia pudding&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't talk about what to do with chia seeds without bringing up chia pudding. "Chia pudding is so thick and creamy because of the way the seeds interact and plump up when combined with liquid," explains Chief Food Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/11320/kate-merker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kate Merker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kate Merker&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on what else you add to the equation, this dish can be enjoyed as a breakfast, snack or fun dessert. No matter &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you eat it, know it'll probably help you stay satiated. "I had chia pudding while I was traveling, and it kept me full, so now I make it at home," says Kitchen Appliances Lab Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/223025/nicole-papantoniou/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nicole Papantoniou;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nicole Papantoniou&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blend into smoothies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Papantoniou also recommends adding some chia seeds to your smoothie. "Don't add too many, though, because the seeds can change the texture and make the drink jiggly," she warns. You should be good with adding just a tablespoon to your favorite smoothie recipe to start. That's the amount we used in our &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/food-recipes/a38684144/make-ahead-smoothies-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Berry, Chia and Mint Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a jam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where chia seeds' ability to absorb liquid and plump up &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;comes into play in the best way possible. Combining chia seeds with muddled berries and maple syrup results in a naturally thickened (quick!) jam — no need for additional pectin or gelatin. "I'll use it when I'm cooking down just plain frozen fruit for a jam," says Deputy Editor &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/226537/sarah-wharton/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sarah Gregory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sarah Gregory&lt;/a&gt;. She then will spread the jam on toast, stir into oatmeal or even layer into a breakfast oat bar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Boost your energy bites&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you usually DIY these nutrient-dense snacks to stash in your fridge or freezer, stir some chia seeds into your next batch. Nutrition Director &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/author/224673/stefani-sassos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stefani Sassos, M.S., R.D.N., NASM-CPT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stefani Sassos, M.S., R.D.N., NASM-CPT&lt;/a&gt; always adds chia seeds to her energy bites.

They will contribute crunch to whatever you sprinkle 'em on. That can include yogurt or smoothie bowls, with a handful of granola, as well as salads. Papantoniou loves to sprinkle some on top of bananas with peanut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should you store chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the recommendation is to store chia seeds in a cool, dark place (read: your pantry), only half of the food team stores them there. The other half keeps theirs in the freezer, which can help prolong their shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you eat &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;many chia seeds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, yes. "Chia seeds are little nutritional powerhouses, but you can get too much of a good thing. Eating them in large amounts may lead to digestive distress since they are very high in fiber," says Sassos. Be sure to drink plenty of water to help the fiber properly digest, and introduce them gradually into your diet. This really applies to any high-fiber food, since you need to allow your digestive system some time to adjust to the higher fiber content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 23:14:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE9mS0RlTlZHREt3OFNhX3BYU0tEVkNaT2hoeUxrc0NmYm8zRU5NT3d6NndoWXBOM1FEOW9BTXZMQ01IRjFuX0U3TEF6M1VwWno4emI5ejAxTmJFb2JQSTF5ekJSdTdveUk</guid></item><item><title>This Woman Had No Idea She Had A Life-Threatening Health Issue Until A Preventative MRI Screening - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPazlaZzc3ZENPX1ZuRzBZdjZ4bkdfOWZLbG83SmduVVVKUGJsS3JyaUl2R1V0VGg0RjZNU3BtR3RtMUltdThaS1B0cXowNDFWSkRvRTJwNk1vd0hWckZIazd2bXpMenMwN0tsZmdpZ2VoREgxVnNBTnk0by11MTAyNnh5anUxMVlCOWFRUw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;Prenuvo's scans are elective, meaning they are not covered by insurance. However, Prenuvo &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/pricing" target="_blank"&gt;said on its website&lt;/a&gt; some people "have been able to get full or partial reimbursement." Prices can range anywhere from $999 for a Torso Scan to $2,499 for a Whole Body Scan to $4,499 for an Enhanced Screening in New York City (some of the prices are dependent on location).&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the US, MRIs can cost, on average, $400 to $12,000, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/diagnostics/how-much-does-an-mri-cost" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to GoodRx. Some portion of MRIs could be covered by insurance, but that depends on the type of insurance, whether or not the MRI provider is in or out-of-network, if there are additional medications needed with the procedure, and if it's considered medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

"It was a really good experience, like, it did kind of feel like a spa day — until it didn't," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt; @sarblackburn / Via &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tiktok.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tiktok.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Sarah said she enjoyed the experience overall and was excited to get her results, she said she didn't know what the MRI was going to find. "I think, now, looking back, I was so certain that this was gonna give me peace of mind and that they were not gonna find anything serious," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"So I guess that's why I was so excited. I was like, 'Man, I am gonna sleep &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; after this scan,'" she said. Then she shook her head and added, "No."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah received her results four days later. "The only issue with how I got the results is that they came at 8:30 p.m., and I had nobody to call," she said. "They schedule your nurse practitioner phone call within, like, 24–48 hours...so I just went into a full-blown panic attack when I got my results and ended up in the emergency room because I needed a doctor to tell me what this meant."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt; @sarblackburn / Via &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tiktok.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tiktok.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A spokesperson from Prenuvo told BuzzFeed, "At Prenuvo, patient care and wellbeing are our highest priorities. We strive to deliver clear, actionable, and timely reports to ensure patients receive appropriate clinical context and support with their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Typically, patients will receive their Prenuvo scan within five business days. When findings are considered urgent, patients will be called directly within 24 hours by a member of our medical practice to discuss their findings and recommended follow-up steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"They found one aneurysm on my &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkelley_greene%2Fpreventative-mri-finds-life-threatening-issue&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC10578835%2F&amp;amp;xcust=7848992%7C0%7CRSS%7C60788359&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:splenic artery,;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;splenic artery,&lt;/a&gt;" Sarah shared, "and in the report that they sent me, without, like, any other context, it's like 'one-in-three mortality rate,' like okay, thank you so much."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt; @sarblackburn / Via &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarblackburn/video/7463201078146993454" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tiktok.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;tiktok.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkelley_greene%2Fpreventative-mri-finds-life-threatening-issue&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F23923-splenic-artery-aneurysm&amp;amp;xcust=7848992%7C0%7CRSS%7C60885350&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, "A splenic artery aneurysm is a serious medical condition. It can be life-threatening, especially if you're pregnant. Like other aneurysms, a splenic artery aneurysm is dangerous because it can rupture (break open) or dissect (tear). Ruptures and dissections are medical emergencies that require immediate care." It also notes that "nearly 80% of splenic artery aneurysms occur in females."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can live without your spleen. However, the Mayo Clinic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkelley_greene%2Fpreventative-mri-finds-life-threatening-issue&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinic.org%2Ftests-procedures%2Fsplenectomy%2Fabout%2Fpac-20395066&amp;amp;xcust=7848992%7C0%7CRSS%7C60806547&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:says;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, "After spleen removal, you're more likely to contract serious or life-threatening infections." You may need to take preventive antibiotics or get additional vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;"So yeah. That is how my health anxiety started," Sarah continued. "It was a really dark and hard two months where I was spiraling and freaking out and seeing a lot of doctors, and pretty much treating my body like glass because I had no idea about this, and literally felt like a ticking time bomb was found inside my body."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah later got a CT scan and discovered there were actually not one, but &lt;i&gt;two&lt;/i&gt; splenic aneurysms inside her splenic artery. "So, anyways...now I am getting my spleen removed, and I will be starting the journey of living life without a spleen, which I think is going to be okay and it's going to be better than having to live in fear of having a ruptured aneurysm — but not what I was expecting," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarah said friends have asked her whether she regrets getting the scan or not. "It changes often," she said. "But I feel grateful. I'm happy that I know about this and had the chance to decide what I wanted to do moving forward. But I've also had people say, 'Oh, I have health anxiety, I want to go do this.'"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"For the people that already have existing health anxiety, I truly don't know if I can recommend it because I was just like a normal anxious girlie before this, and now, I'm a normal anxious girlie with debilitating health anxiety that I'm trying to overcome," she continued. "But I will say, I'm pretty proud of myself for the way that I overcame this. And...yeah. Two months ago was a very different story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some commenters in the medical field told Sarah just how lucky she was to have found this condition early. "My jaw dropped reading splenic aneurysm. I've only experienced 3 patients come in the ED [Emergency Department] with a ruptured aneurysm and all three didn't make it," said one commenter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another said, "Provider here. Count your lucky stars-you definitely have a reason to still be here! I know it's terrifying, but you just dodged an untimely death!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Others had lost loved ones to ruptured splenic aneurysms and told Sarah they felt she was lucky, too. One said, "My brother in law just died of a splenic artery aneurysm. He was 39 and extremely healthy. You are so so lucky."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another shared, "One of my best friends passed away from a splenic aneurysm. She was about 37 weeks pregnant &amp;amp; also lost the baby. Getting that scan done is a blessing in disguise whether you realize it or not!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Unsurprisingly, commenters also mentioned they wished that insurance would cover the scans. "I hope one day this can be covered by insurance (or better yet covered by free healthcare) so that everyone can have preventative care," someone said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another said, "I don't understand why every insurance cannot provide 1 full body scan to every person. Just once a year. ... It would be so amazing."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And finally, "Our insurance should cover regular scans," said another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Prenuvo's scans are elective, meaning they are not covered by insurance.

Prices can range anywhere from $999 for a Torso Scan to $2,499 for a Whole Body Scan to $4,499 for an Enhanced Screening in New York City (some of the prices are dependent on location).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the US, MRIs can cost, on average, $400 to $12,000, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fkelley_greene%2Fpreventative-mri-finds-life-threatening-issue&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodrx.com%2Fhealth-topic%2Fdiagnostics%2Fhow-much-does-an-mri-cost&amp;amp;xcust=7848992%7C0%7CRSS%7C60807010&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to GoodRx.

&lt;p&gt;The health department is investigating after an active tuberculosis case was identified at a Waukegan High School campus, which is prompting enhanced cleaning and precautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waukegan Community Unit School District 60 Superintendent Theresa Plascencia sent a letter to part of the Waukegan High School Brookside campus about the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plascencia said an &lt;span&gt;active tuberculosis case has been identified within the Brookside campus school. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The district said they are working closely with the Lake County Health Department to follow all recommended protocols to “ensure the safety and well-being” of students and staff.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff identified as close contacts have already been notified with recommended actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To respect their privacy, we will not be sharing any additional details,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high school is undergoing recommended cleaning procedures as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School operations continued as usual on Monday with continued cleaning and COVID-era air filtration enhancements in place, Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;is spread through the air from one person to another. The disease germs are emitted into the air when a person with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease of the lungs or throat coughs, speaks or sings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;disease are most likely to spread &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;germs to people they spend time with every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;can make a person very ill, Plascencia said in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If not treated, it can lead to serious health complications. Only people with active TB disease can spread the germ to others. Those with ‘latent’ TB have the germ in the body but cannot spread it to others. Both active and latent TB are treatable,” Plascencia said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who experiences symptoms associated with tuberculosis, such as a persistent cough lasting three weeks or longer, coughing up blood, pain with breathing or coughing, chest pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, unexplained weight loss, fever, chills or night sweats, is asked to contact their healthcare provider or the Lake County Health Department &lt;span&gt;tuberculosis &lt;/span&gt;clinic at 847-377-8700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school district is hosting a virtual town hall at 6 p.m. on Tuesday with the Lake County Health Department to answer questions students and parents have.&lt;/p&gt;

Your red eyes and runny noses don’t deceive you — seasonal allergies are getting worse, a miserable reality for nearly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm"&gt;one in three US adults and one in four children&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Why? Sneezing and sniffles are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epub/10.1073/pnas.2013284118"&gt;sirens of climate change&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, because of warming, pollen is now a nearly year-round menace in some parts of the US. Pollen, the main seasonal allergy trigger, is emerging earlier in the year, in higher concentrations, and lasting longer year after year. “In the springtime, the first pollen allergens are from trees, and that is starting 20 days earlier than it did 30 years ago,” said &lt;a href="https://aafa.org/about-aafa/senior-staff/"&gt;Kenneth Mendez&lt;/a&gt;, CEO of AAFA. Rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are directly inducing plants to produce more pollen while extending the temperature conditions that trigger pollen production in plants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We hear all the time, ‘I’ve never had allergies before and now I suddenly feel like I have allergies,’ or ‘I feel like my allergies are getting a lot worse’ and that’s because the allergic load is that much higher because of climate change,” Mendez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For most people, seasonal allergies are an unpleasant nuisance. But with millions feeling &lt;em&gt;blergh&lt;/em&gt; at the same time, it adds up to a huge economic burden in lost productivity. Asthma, allergic rhinitis — the condition you probably know of as hay fever — and related allergy conditions &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14737167.2020.1819793#d1e333"&gt;cost the economy billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; each year in lost work days, medications, and doctor’s visits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are also people for whom pollen is a more serious problem and can lead to dangerous complications or exacerbate other health issues. One study found that tree pollen allergies lead to &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018GH000153"&gt;25,000 to 50,000 emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; per year, two-thirds from people under the age of 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Over time, as pollen counts increase, more people with a higher sensitivity threshold are finding out the hard way that these tiny grains are a hazard. Other people are also finding out that doors and windows can’t protect them as some of the tiniest pollen grains seep in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“If the trendlines continue, I think more people are going to feel miserable from allergies,” Mendez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="how-we-keep-making-allergies-worse-for-ourselves" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;How we keep making allergies worse for ourselves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem for allergy sufferers is that their body’s defense mechanisms sometimes overreact to something benign. Usually, it leads to mild, easily treatable symptoms. But allergens can also trigger more serious complications like &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21461-allergic-asthma"&gt;asthma attacks&lt;/a&gt;, causing wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. In rare cases, they &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000844.htm"&gt;can lead to anaphylaxis&lt;/a&gt;, a whole-body reaction where the airways can swell shut and blood pressure drops to dangerously low levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The vast majority of pollen allergies are more annoying than dangerous, but seasonal pollen is so ubiquitous that it’s almost impossible to avoid, sneaking indoors through vents, window seals, on clothing, and in pet fur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some people are more sensitive than others, but the relentless, growing exposure can add up to misery even for those with mild allergies. Pollen grains range in size from &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.1191"&gt;100 down to less than 10 microns&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to penetrate deep into the lungs and irritate airways. Many types of plants release pollen as part of their reproductive cycle. Generally, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6934246/"&gt;trees spread pollen in the spring&lt;/a&gt;, grasses over the summer, and ragweed in the autumn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Airborne cloud of pine pollen from male pine cones in Arizona.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Wild Horizons/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, the historical pollen timing patterns have already shifted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Tree pollen is wafting off of branches earlier in the season almost every year. Some grass species have seen their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28764-0"&gt;pollen release days delayed by almost a month&lt;/a&gt; while their overall season has grown longer. As a result, grass pollen increasingly overlaps with the &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-ragweed-pollen-season"&gt;ragweed pollen season&lt;/a&gt;, which itself has been extended by more than three weeks in some parts of the country since 1995. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are two key mechanisms driving this trend, both induced by humanity’s appetite for fossil fuels. Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning coal, oil, and natural gas &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7346998/"&gt;directly induce many plant species to produce more pollen&lt;/a&gt;. Carbon dioxide can make plants grow bigger and faster, and &lt;a href="https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/greenhouse-carbon-dioxide-supplementation.html"&gt;produce more flowers&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to more pollen. More pollen leads to more seeds, which means even more plants spraying pollen the next season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are also warming the planet and changing the climate. In general, that means &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-seasonal-temperature"&gt;warmer, shorter winters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northeast/topic/climate-warming-brings-earlier-spring"&gt;earlier springs&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to longer growing seasons for plants. These trends will continue as global average temperatures go up, making allergies a significant public health burden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some parts of the country, such as Texas, are on track to see &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/allergy/articles/10.3389/falgy.2022.959594/full"&gt;pollen counts almost double&lt;/a&gt; by 2050 compared to 2000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="its-not-just-pollen-you-have-to-worry-about" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;It’s not just pollen you have to worry about&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For many people, allergies are an added complication on top of other health and environmental conditions. Air pollution from ozone, particulates, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds can cause their own breathing problems, but when they intersect with allergies, they can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8638356/"&gt;make symptoms even worse&lt;/a&gt;. Pollution from roads can make pollen from nearby plants &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2012.02846.x"&gt;more potent at triggering allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10176314/"&gt;Smoke from wildfires&lt;/a&gt; can also exacerbate allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Cities may not offer much refuge. Changes to the landscape like urbanization can create a &lt;a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.2512"&gt;more favorable habitat&lt;/a&gt; for plants like ragweed. City centers also tend to warm up faster than their rural surroundings and experience higher concentrations of air pollutants, compounding the effects of allergies. These factors are especially potent in low-income and underserved communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Pollen isn’t the only allergen changing with the climate either. Rising temperatures and precipitation in some areas are &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-92178-z"&gt;increasing the number and duration of allergenic mold spores&lt;/a&gt;. Extreme weather further worsens the problem, as the damage and destruction create conditions for more mold. That was evident in New Orleans last year as storms like &lt;a href="http://v"&gt;Hurricane Francine&lt;/a&gt; soaked the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“When these storms come through, they create so much damage over the landscape of the state. Some communities have resources to immediately move in and repair roofs and patch windows, and then we have a lot of folks that simply don’t have those resources. With leaking roofs, you have mold growth indoors,” said &lt;a href="https://www.ochsner.org/doctors/john-clifford-carlson"&gt;John Carlson&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the high-risk allergy division at the Ochsner health system in New Orleans. “Because it’s so warm here, we can grow mold year round as long as there’s moisture.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;High winds from storms can also whip up dust, which can then trigger asthma. Additionally, there’s a phenomenon called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6512777/"&gt;thunderstorm asthma&lt;/a&gt;, where the weather conditions can &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/can-a-thunderstorm-trigger-asthma"&gt;rupture pollen grains&lt;/a&gt; into smaller, more allergenic fragments, triggering asthma attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s not clear whether the overall number of people with seasonal allergies is increasing. The US may be approaching a plateau in the number of people who are susceptible to pollen, Carlson said. At the same time, there are other conditions that can present with allergy-like symptoms, and at high enough concentrations, even people without allergies will wheeze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“In New Orleans, we have a ton of oak pollen — I mean, just so much oak pollen in the air — and you commonly have a lot of people who don’t have oak pollen allergy nevertheless with itchy eyes and the sneezing from just the irritant effect of the particles,” Carlson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The good news is that there are ways to contain the worst effects of seasonal allergies. For people with a history of bothersome seasonal allergies, seeing an allergist and finding out what their specific triggers are and what medicines work is key. It may make sense to start taking medications like nose sprays or over-the-counter allergy drugs before pollen ramps up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We generally say to have your medications in your system close to two weeks ahead of time because it takes some time to build up,” Mendez said. For people who don’t know if they have allergies but are concerned about the threat, pay attention to your symptoms and see an allergist if you do start to experience irritated eyes and airways. There are also more aggressive interventions for people with severe allergies who don’t respond to other medicines like desensitization therapy, also known as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25194-allergy-shots"&gt;allergy shots&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some of the same measures for avoiding air pollution also work for pollen. Pay attention to pollen forecasts in your local area. Avoid being outside and close doors and windows during high pollen release times, particularly in the morning. Leave your coat and shoes outside or locked away before you settle down at home. Wipe down your dog after a walk. Use a HEPA air filter in your living spaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Over the long term, it’s prudent to curb emissions of heat-trapping gasses that worsen climate change and allergies. For now, keep the tissues close. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 21:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNUGZ6THMzOHQ5aTNWYmtCd1BnNi1KMzB1Y2VVaUQ4OXRtTUVZTm4yeU1nSGlIZHJMZ2RnbXFqaExhQ2pJdDlhWGsyRjBWcEstdWRFQzFwNDZ3a1VIWlg0U0h5SEd5ZjRBS1ZFRVZqVjZiLTZXUHhfSDBsOWpSUmI2cnliaVRPMUU</guid></item><item><title>Pa. measles cases prompt CVS to push vaccine statewide - TribLIVE.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQY3gxRjM2R2xNaWx1bnd6RU0xN29YUFhtaUZnTHpROFdmOXp4MHpPTzZUMnlZZmtpZUxzaFpPRVAwVUd3SFR0b2hTTTlaTHJDdVBEVU5OSlhQY0ZOaWt4TWJpQWhMckRwME1LZDhUZGNlRG16OHpEbnlFZVZJSVZMTEdDV0ZWczhXYW01VjJvVEhjMTY3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="container"&gt;

health officials urge vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KNOX COUNTY, Ohio — Just last week, the Ohio Department of Health announced that there was a confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.10tv.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles case&lt;/a&gt; in Knox County. Now, two more cases have been confirmed in the county.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ODH said the initial case in Knox County was from a visitor to the county who exposed others in Knox and nearby counties. The two additional cases were found in international travelers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Knox County Public Health, the individuals with measles are isolated and their symptoms are being monitored.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county health department has been working with the individuals since contact tracing began and they have been in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director Bruce Vanderhoff also announced last week that there was a measles outbreak in Ashtabula County. ODH and Ashtabula County have identified 10 measles cases. Nine of the cases are &lt;a href="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-first-measles-case-2025-ashtabula-county/530-9f8dfb61-d0f1-48c0-ab90-916ba69e2b5e" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.10tv.com/article/news/local/ohio/ohio-first-measles-case-2025-ashtabula-county/530-9f8dfb61-d0f1-48c0-ab90-916ba69e2b5e"&gt;linked to an adult man&lt;/a&gt; reported last week as the state's first measles case of the year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This disease can be very serious, even deadly, but it is almost entirely avoidable by being properly vaccinated. Measles is especially dangerous for young children, so I strongly urge all parents across Ohio to make sure your children are vaccinated. It is a crucial layer of protection that can save lives," Vanderhoff said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical professionals warn we may begin to see more cases of measles in the next few weeks, as this is typically the time it takes for the virus to manifest symptoms after exposure. Symptoms usually start to appear about 13 to 14 days following infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you return from vacation and start to feel unwell shortly thereafter, it's possible that you may have been exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to prevent measles?&lt;/h3&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says the best way to protect yourself is with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. Two doses of the vaccine are about 97% effect at preventing measles. One dose is about 93% effective.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smartphones are an incredible tool for understanding patterns of feelings, behavior, and experiences in daily life, and how different types of everyday events stay with us in memory,” says Elizabeth Goldfarb of Yale University, who is chairing a session at the annual meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society (CNS) about the use of smartphones in capturing naturalistic data about memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Real experiences have so much more salience and self-relevance than anything I can generate in the lab, and being able to quantify how people remember those events is very exciting.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers will be sharing new smartphone-based studies that suggest how a range of actions people take—from trying something new, to replaying memories before sleep, to feeling positive emotions—can help them build stronger and more detailed memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These talks examine both how researchers can use these data to capture how factors like emotion, novelty, and dreams transform memories, and suggest ways that people can strengthen their own memories,” Goldfarb says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory replay and sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Barense’s current work using smartphones to capture real-time data on memory, sleep, and dreams was inspired by a serendipitous discovery in a study that wasn’t designed to look at sleep and memory at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the timing of when someone first reviews material relative to sleep had an enormous effect on how well they later remembered it,” says Barense of the University of Toronto, who will be presenting new work at the CNS meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The effect was so striking that I initially didn’t believe it. That discovery made me realize that sleep is something all memory scientists should be paying close attention to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now working on studies designed by graduate student Nelly Matorina, Barense and her team are investigating a fundamental question using a smartphone app they developed that is called  HippoCamera: How does a single night of sleep influence our memory for the events that occurred the day before? For example, if you dream about a dinner party from the night before, does that influence your memory for that event?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using HippoCamera, participants recorded two events per day—one in the morning and one in the evening—over two weeks. The researchers then tested their memories after 12-hour delays that either included a night of sleep or a day spent awake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their pre-press results showed that “memories following sleep were more vivid, felt temporally closer, and were easier to recall, suggesting that a single night of sleep helps preserve the richness of autobiographical memory,” Barense says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also asked participants to record their dreams upon waking and indicate whether they were related to events captured with HippoCamera the previous evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, memories that were dreamt about were also rated as feeling temporally closer and were more likely to be recalled from a first-person perspective,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these short-term effects, the team tested the same memories one year later to ask how they changed over time, including the connection to the memories’ locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our pattern of results suggests that the link between an event and its location may initially weaken after a night’s sleep to allow for memory reorganization, but over the long term, a year later, our memory is strongly connected to where it took place,” Matorina says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Real-world data collection introduces variability that is difficult to control, and tracking sleep and memory over time requires careful methodological design,” Barense says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, these challenges are also what make smartphone-based research so promising—it allows us to move beyond artificial settings and study memory as it naturally unfolds in daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By illuminating the crucial role of sleep and dreaming in memory, Barense and her team hope to gain windows into memory plasticity—better understanding the connection between sleep and our waking experiences and laying the groundwork for new ways to boost memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future work, in collaboration with Ken Paller and his lab at Northwestern University, her team will investigate if it is possible to enhance real-world memory retention during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will be integrating HippoCamera with at-home targeted memory reactivation, which works by reintroducing memory-related cues—such as sounds associated with an event—during specific sleep stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While our previous work has shown that HippoCamera strengthens autobiographical memory in older adults, we believe that incorporating sleep-based memory reactivation will further amplify its benefits,” Barense says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory vividness and novelty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lila Davachi’s smartphone-based work on memory was motivated by the cognitive and emotional impacts of the pandemic that came up in almost every conversation she and the research team had during the COVID-19 shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lab had already published several papers on the impact of context representations on associative memory and here we all were sitting in our homes, meeting on Zoom, with very little change in our contexts,” says Davachi of Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was natural to wonder how this was going to impact our long-term memories and, perhaps by consequence, our mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapting a well-validated data collection method from social psychology, Davachi and her team ran a “daily diary” study that sampled real-world experiences using a smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They asked study participants to report daily events over a two-week period, and then after a two-week delay, the researchers asked them to recall the autobiographical experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On each day and for each event, participants were asked to categorize each event as “novel,” “routine,” or “periodic.” as well as answer several other questions about the events and their days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence (AI) to help analyze the large number of subjective events recorded, the team found that novel autobiographical events were later reported with greater vividness and detail compared to both routine and periodic events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps more exciting, we found that routine and periodic events that happened on the same day as a novel event were also better remembered than routine and periodic events that took place on days with less novelty,” Davachi explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests a penumbra-like effect of novelty.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That novelty improves memory for not only a novel event but also for adjacent events throughout the day suggests that “experiential diversity” is an important factor for forming lasting memories—and it’s something that people might be able to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work, Davachi says, is bringing researchers closer to understanding how and if laboratory studies of memory and their findings translate to real-world autobiographical experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to sample and record data from individuals in the real world, along with the use of AI-based large language models to help us analyze large amounts of complex data, is a solid stepping stone,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory emotions and alcohol&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all memory studies, a major challenge is quantifying memory accuracy, says Goldfarb of Yale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are asking someone to tell us about an event that happened years ago, we can measure whether they tell us the same details consistently, but we don’t know if those details are ‘correct’ because we were not there when the event occurred,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By using smartphone technology, we can effectively be there with the participant while the event is happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldfarb’s work, these techniques are opening doors to answering new questions, including how people remember stressful or emotional events. In one study she will be presenting at the CNS conference, Goldfarb and her team are looking at memories and emotions in the context of substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Memory is important for addiction, as, for example, someone can’t relapse in a place where they used to drink if they have no memory of drinking there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yet we know very little about what people remember about their time drinking that drives this behavior,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With smartphones, the researchers can now share what they remember about their real experiences with alcohol and compare that to previous lab-based studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re uncovering some similarities with what we measure in the lab, which is great for establishing ecological validity,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by measuring the memories that could directly inform real-life substance use, they are also capturing new data, such as how memories for positive and negative experiences are organized differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing that people are more likely to link different parts of a positive event together in memory,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a researcher, the effects of real emotions are so much stronger than what we can create in the lab.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, Goldfarb says, the research being presented at CNS 2025—about novelty, replay, and emotion—are a leap forward in helping people build stronger and more detailed memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep, emotion, and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cogneurosociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lisa M.P.

The study found that people with higher PTSD symptoms were more likely to fear strong emotions, which led to less constructive and more conflict-driven communication styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These emotional fears contribute to patterns like demand-withdraw behavior, where one partner pressures and the other retreats, reinforcing both relationship strain and PTSD symptoms. Researchers emphasize that addressing fear of emotions alongside PTSD symptoms may improve communication and support recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Fear Link:&lt;/strong&gt; PTSD symptoms are associated with fear of strong emotions, impacting communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destructive Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Fear of emotions increases demand-withdraw dynamics in couples.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Opportunity:&lt;/strong&gt; Addressing both PTSD and emotional fears can improve relationships and healing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Penn State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms often have trouble communicating and resolving relationship difficulties with their romantic partners, according to previous research by Steffany Fredman, associate professor of human development and family studies at Penn State, and others. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, Fredman and others have found that some of these problems may stem from people’s fear of their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108308"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a couple on chairs facing each other." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/ptsd-emotion-relationships-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The current study extended this prior work by demonstrating that individuals’ PTSD symptoms may predispose them to catastrophic thoughts about feeling strong emotions and that such thoughts may be why couples in which one or both partners have elevated PTSD symptoms tend to have a hard time communicating constructively. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers collected data from 64 opposite-sex couples in which both members of the couple had experienced a traumatic life event. The researchers analyzed PTSD symptom data from each member of the couple about perceived negative consequences if they feel strong emotions and how they and their partner tend to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results published in &lt;em&gt;Behaviour Research and Therapy&lt;/em&gt; demonstrated that people with higher levels of PTSD symptoms experienced greater fear of their emotions, which was associated with less constructive communication and more unproductive communication with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we were trying to understand why people with PTSD symptoms have trouble resolving relationship difficulties with their romantic partners,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally speaking, people with PTSD view themselves and other people negatively, and the resulting mistrust, anger, avoidance, withdrawal and emotional numbing put strain on their romantic relationships. Experiencing your feelings, trusting people and connecting with others are all important ingredients for healing from PTSD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PTSD can create a vicious cycle, according to Fredman. Behavior triggered by PTSD symptoms such as aggression, avoidance, withdrawal and numbing may strain relationships, and relationship discord can maintain PTSD symptoms. This cycle continues unless something changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fredman co-developed couple-based treatment for PTSD to disrupt this cycle. Individuals with PTSD often experience emotions as dangerous and a trigger — or a trauma reminder — because strong emotions were felt during or after their trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since romantic relationships evoke many strong emotions, people may experience emotionally evocative interactions with their partners as threatening and can engage in behaviors to neutralize this perceived threat, such as becoming aggressive and/or withdrawing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one or both partners develop unhealthy coping skills, strained romantic relationships can reinforce the symptoms of PTSD. On the other hand, relationships in which people can both express themselves and listen can promote recovery from PTSD, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers recruited people with a broad range of PTSD symptoms and symptom severity. Studying people with a broad range of severity allowed the research team to understand the ways that more or less severe symptoms were likely to affect communication in a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers interviewed participants about their PTSD symptoms and asked participants whether they feared their emotions. They also asked whether they typically communicate constructively — which involves collaborative problem solving, listening, suggesting compromises and expressing one’s feelings; whether they demand while their partner withdraws; and whether their partner demands while they withdraw when relationship issues arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In demand/withdraw communication, one partner complains, nags or otherwise tries to demand a response from their partner. The other partner responds by withdrawing and avoiding the interaction. Typically, Fredman said, the more one person withdraws, the more the other partner demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This type of communication does not facilitate problem solving and often leaves issues unresolved. Unproductive and unresolved conflict can maintain PTSD symptoms by reinforcing perceptions of interpersonal threat and negative views of oneself and the other partner, Fredman continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants who reported higher levels of PTSD symptoms were more likely to report fear of their emotions. Additionally, those who reported greater fear of their emotions were less likely to report constructive communication and were more likely to report that they demand while their partner withdraws and that their partner demands while they withdraw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to identify that fear of emotions has interpersonal consequences, according to Fredman, meaning the fear influences how people interact with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we only looked at PTSD symptoms and communication without considering a person’s fear of their emotions, there were relatively few direct connections we could identify,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we looked at the connections between PTSD symptoms and fear of emotions and then examined the connections between fear of emotions and communication styles, the connections became clear. This suggests that fear of emotions is an important influence on the communication style of couples where one or both people have PTSD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior work by Fredman and colleagues demonstrated that individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms had difficulties regulating their own emotional arousal during laboratory-based conversations with their partners about their relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, they responded to their own emotional arousal and the emotional arousal communicated through their partner’s voice in a manner consistent with emotional arousal serving as a trauma cue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current study extended this prior work by demonstrating that individuals’ PTSD symptoms may predispose them to catastrophic thoughts about feeling strong emotions and that such thoughts may be why couples in which one or both partners have elevated PTSD symptoms tend to have a hard time communicating constructively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other research we conducted has shown that couple therapy can effectively reduce PTSD symptoms and improve relationship communication, even in just a single weekend,” Fredman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This latest study reveals more nuance about how PTSD symptoms, fear of emotions and communication difficulties are connected and why they should be treated at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeesun Lee, graduate student in human development and family studies at Penn State; Yunying Le, who earned her doctorate in human development and family studies in 2019 and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Penn State and is now research assistant professor at University of Denver; Emily Taverna, who earned her doctorate in 2023 psychology at Penn State and is now Advanced Fellow in Women’s Health at the Women’s Health Sciences Division of the National Center for PTSD; and Amy Marshall, professor at Virginia Tech, also contributed to this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The National Center for Advancing Translational Science, the Karl R.

Using sleep studies and brain imaging data from 270 participants, researchers found that poor sleep architecture was linked to brain atrophy over time—particularly in the inferior parietal region, an area affected early in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations held even after accounting for factors like age, heart health, and lifestyle habits.

An estimated 6.7 million Americans aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer’s disease, and this number is projected to double by 2060, pending medical developments to prevent, slow or cure the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved an analysis of data from 270 participants who had a median age of 61 years. Fifty-three percent were female, and all participants were white. Individuals were excluded from the analysis if they previously had a stroke or probable dementia or other significant brain pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research utilized polysomnography to assess baseline sleep architecture. Advanced brain imaging techniques were used to measure brain volumes 13 to 17 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, the study demonstrates an important association between sleep and long-term brain health, and it highlights potential opportunities to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep architecture may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, posing the opportunity to explore interventions to reduce risk or delay Alzheimer’s onset,” said Cho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that further investigation is needed to fully understand the causal relationships between sleep architecture and Alzheimer’s disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8be6eeefe2eacbeaeaf8e6a5e4f9ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Thomas Heffron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Thomas Heffron – AASM&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.11630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions&lt;/a&gt;” by Gawon Cho et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e188"&gt;Study Objectives:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep deficiency is associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. We examined the association of sleep architecture with anatomical features observed in AD: (1) atrophy of hippocampus, entorhinal, inferior parietal, parahippocampal, precuneus, and cuneus regions (“AD-vulnerable regions”) and (2) cerebral microbleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e195"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 270 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study, we examined the association of baseline sleep architecture with anatomical features identified on brain MRI 13∼17 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep architecture was quantified as the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS), proportion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and arousals index using polysomnography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes included (1) volumetric measurements of each AD-vulnerable region and (2) the presence of any cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and that of lobar CMBs, which are more specifically associated with AD. We analyzed the association of each sleep predictor with each MRI outcome, adjusting for covariates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="d1e202"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Median age was 61, 53% female, 100% were White, and 47% had 16+ years of education. Mmedian times in SWS and REM were 17.4% and 21.5%, respectively. Having less SWS was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-44.18 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per -1 percentage point [PP] of SWS, [95%CI=-76.62, -11.74]) and cuneus (β=-11.98 [=-20.92, -3.04] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per -1 PP of SWS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having less REM was associated with smaller volumes of the inferior parietal region (β=-75.54 [-129.36, -21.72] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per 1 PP of REM) and precuneus (β=-31.92 [-63.78,-0.06] mm&lt;sup&gt;3 &lt;/sup&gt;per 1 PP of REM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After FDR adjustments, lower SWS and REM were associated with significantly smaller inferior parietal region volumes.

(She struggles to speak for long periods due to her treatment.) “I had general tiredness.”Riehle visited her primary care doctor and a dentist to understand why she was experiencing such terrible pain. Finally, an ear, nose and throat doctor biopsied her tongue and figured out what caused her headaches — Stage 4 tongue cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It wasn’t until I saw a specialist that I found out what I was facing,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Headaches and tongue discoloration &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When the headaches started, Riehle visited her medical providers. She first saw her dentist.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“She noticed some discoloration on my tongue but never discussed what it might be,” she says. “My primary care physician also examined me when I came in for my original complaints but also never alluded to any major problems.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When she met with her primary care physician, they suggested that she visit an otolaryngologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He thought maybe the pains were symptoms of my TMJ,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;TMJ, the temporomandibular joint that connects the jaw to the skull, can cause disorders that can lead to pain in the face, head, jaw and ears, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tmj/symptoms-causes/syc-20350941" target="_blank"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But when the ENT doctor examined Riehle, they noticed something unusual on her tongue and instead performed a punch biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In March 2024, the results of the biopsy returned, and Riehle learned she had Stage 4 squamous cell carcinoma in her tongue. The diagnosis felt devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It (feels) extremely lonely having a cancer most people my age don’t get,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Doctors provided her with two treatment options — surgery that would remove her tongue, or radiation and chemotherapy. She opted for the latter. Riehle started with radiation five days a week with weekly chemotherapy. Two months after finishing treatment, she experienced a new symptom.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I started having terrible shooting pains across my forehead and neck,” she says. “I assumed they were delayed reactions to the radiation.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-04-597f8f.jpg" alt="Beth Riehle tongue cancer"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;After undergoing radiation and chemotherapy for Stage 4 tongue cancer, Beth Riehle thought she was cancer free. Sadly, two months later doctors found a new tumor, which was a recurrence of her cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Beth Riehle &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In September 2024, she visited an emergency room and doctors admitted her to the hospital. She also underwent a CT scan to check that the cancer was gone. Days later, doctors shared some more upsetting news. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They told me my cancer was ‘treatment resistant,’” Riehle says. “I had a recurrence and a second tumor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle began treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Doctors recommended that she undergo the surgery to remove the tumor and most of her tongue, a procedure that’s called a glossectomy. She felt worried about the surgery and what life after would be like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Doctors told me I’d have a 50/50 chance of speaking again,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The same day that she learned she needed surgery, her fiancé, Donald, proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He made what was the worst day of my life also one of the most memorable,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Tongue cancer in young women&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Tongue cancer has long been associated with older men who smoke, chew tobacco and drink alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It is unusual for someone who’s young, less than 40 years of age without the traditional risk factors to develop a tongue cancer like this,” Dr. Karen Choi, a head and neck surgeon at MD Anderson Cancer Center and one of Riehle’s doctors, tells TODAY.com. “Although oral cavity cancer typically affects the older male population, we are actually seeing a rise of this type of cancer in young patients.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;More people under 45, especially woman, are being diagnosed with tongue cancer, and experts are unsure why. The type of cancer Riehle has is not associated with &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/cancer-vaccine-hpv-rcna195393" target="_blank"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“These patients don’t necessarily have those risk factors that we associate with that type of cancer,” Choi says. “We don’t really know what that is. We just know the incidence has been increasing over the last several decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Choi adds that knowing the signs of tongue cancer and seeking care can lead to an earlier diagnosis. Symptoms of tongue cancer include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ulcer that lasts more than two weeks  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pain in the same spot when eating and drinking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An ulcer that bleeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Many people visit a dentist first. If the dentist rules out dental problems and the symptoms persist, Choi says to follow up with your primary care doctor, who can make a referral to an ENT or oral surgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Treatment for tongue cancer can include radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. The earlier the cancer is found, the better the outlook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/Beth-Riehle-tongue-cancer-mc-250331-02-9e454f.jpg" alt="Beth Riehle tongue cancer"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Beth Riehle has undergo radiation, chemotherapy and surgery to treat her Stage 4 tongue cancer. She's now looking forward to visiting Hawaii with her fiance and planning their wedding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Beth Riehle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“If you have an early stage cancer, meaning cancer that is small, has not spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, generally prognosis is good,” Choi says. “The larger the tumor is, or if the cancer has started to spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, then prognosis does go down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;‘A powerful experience’ &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of November 2024, Riehle underwent a 12-hour- glossectomy. Doctors removed 80% of her tongue and 75 lymph nodes from her neck and created a “flap” in her mouth, using some of a muscle from her leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Prior to surgery, she had a feeding tube placed because eating was too painful from so much radiation to her head and neck. During surgery, doctors also gave her a tracheotomy to help her breathe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s so much swelling ... in the back of the throat. Putting a tracheotomy tube allows us to bypass that swelling so she can breathe comfortably,” Choi explains. “Once the swelling resolves and goes down enough that it’s not blocking off the airway from the mouth and nose pathway, the trach can be removed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle remembers "doing so well after surgery. It was the first time I had been cancer-free in almost a year, so my body was really receptive to recovery," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But the additional 30 radiation sessions and living without her full tongue have taken a toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While Riehle felt pleasantly surprised the first time she spoke after surgery, she struggles to open her mouth due to tightness in her jaw muscles, a condition called trismus, common in people being treated for head and neck cancers, the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24086-trismus" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I have mouth sores and mucositis, which is when you overproduce thick secretions. It’s difficult to swallow and talk,” she adds. “I’m exhausted, if I’m being honest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle also attends speech therapy to improve her ability swallow, speak and open her mouth. Her goal one day is to be able to put a prosthetic in her mouth to make her speech clearer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“(Your tongue) is such an integral part of life — food, air communication,” she says. “I’ve had to re-learn how to do just about everything your mouth functions for.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;She feels pleased to learn that, despite the pain and uncertainty of what’s she’s been through in the past year, she’s still herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I’ve learned that given the circumstances, I can still manage to laugh and make others laugh,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As part of her recovery, Riehle began posting “fit checks” on social media.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I wanted to use &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isthisriehlelife" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to track my progress as far as my speech,” she says. “I also thought that by putting my experience out there, I might be able to help someone else my age or someone going through my experience in the way I wished for when I was first diagnosed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the end of February, Riehle finished radiation and had her trach removed. Sometimes, she marvels at what she's been through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I never in a million years thought I would be strong enough,” she says. “There’s a deep sense of bravery and the ability to overcome the adversity inside us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Riehle found a group called &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/disease/rise-tongue-cancer-young-women-rcna96249?search=Young%20Tongues" target="_blank"&gt;Young Tongues&lt;/a&gt;, which offers support to young people with tongue cancer, and she’s received encouragement after going viral on social media. Finding community helps and motivates her to share her story to be there for others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I’ve had people who have undergone the same surgery as me find me and show appreciation for giving a voice to a group of people who aren’t necessarily represented,” she says. “It’s been a powerful experience and an important reminder of vulnerability’s place in our lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:05:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNS2xLYS1JS3hfNzVfSzNXZVdfbUlVaGsyY0dCLUFfWHM1ZWh1TE9qN1dhYkExd2JtVy1jUThHd1BDeU1hMlZPSmtTWVhaRFdyZWtnWEpyYm1YMlZmaHREczFYUERnY2syOGpNUHE4RjBXcDBzMEduQ1VGVktCcDgxSkh5RXFuYVXSAVRBVV95cUxOU0RFd2RGeERHVUxjOXExS1htYVZEV2pxNzVPdE1EcXcxOThLOVYzc2VBbkVOcF9lZlVQRWl6eGhlc0x4MmRlbFh5djBLakZhWHU3SnI</guid></item><item><title>What to know about vitamin A's toxic risks after RFK Jr. promotes it for measles - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcmwtbWg3NUVocmdWaF92SC1MU0RoaURBUHdVVWVCUE1qbXVqekdtVldXWmJoX25KZVpiUERLLVFJUTlJcnRQemhxT1pEczFmbFZzaVEyaGFtRG01NzNGX3JpLXR6RHd4eVBXOVEwVFh5RUlyQmtiMUZjOVRPN1hRUUNNeFlIVlVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 19:02:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQcmwtbWg3NUVocmdWaF92SC1MU0RoaURBUHdVVWVCUE1qbXVqekdtVldXWmJoX25KZVpiUERLLVFJUTlJcnRQemhxT1pEczFmbFZzaVEyaGFtRG01NzNGX3JpLXR6RHd4eVBXOVEwVFh5RUlyQmtiMUZjOVRPN1hRUUNNeFlIVlVY</guid></item><item><title>I'm a doctor... and your sleeping position reveals a lot about your health - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQSzRJdE1WeUZiN3E1RnhtS0lLMnZ1dUFFd3M0V0lUTmt0aERlLTE5RHZETi1sZWFtWTRpdEVTeVdvRVYxbmhudTBLRGVWZEJqVUtVbUpUY0NSTE00dG1pa2ZEenZsRnNKRzdoTnpHaFJHSUNrUHFIN3B0WVpBcEJZcXFmOHVaQy02cVhtY28za1JMeUU3cjZ0MWlUWVhGNXhha3JIdG80SjfSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUloNmVWY1J4MkVWbnNWQTU0eFpPY1Rhd21NTFhVYUYxZ0MyYzhXNHZ6YlM0YURaQ19ibjdOc0Q1cGRqLTJUZEx5RFpBWjZzZmxDUlNfck1qajdPNThOZUFrYWk0dzBzRGJFWnRSWTdfSnpFNFNjNHQ3NURBVjRLYV8wa04temd2d1ZRcF9UZTZrYUVudXdQUl9ZZUxaNktuZk84cTktTVQyT1dqem9n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A professional psychologist has revealed the five most common sleeping positions that suggest you may be under high stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kyle Osbourne, a clinical psychologist at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Philadelphia, said &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-14495773/why-waking-middle-night-diet-stress.html"&gt;stress and sleep quality are closely linked&lt;/a&gt;, with stress impacting sleep and poor sleep exacerbating stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you are under stress, your body releases cortisol, a critical hormone in managing your body’s reaction to stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to controlling our sleep-wake cycle, cortisol helps us regulate our metabolism and reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prolonged, elevated cortisol levels or chronic stress can disrupt these processes, leading to inflammation, chronic pain, anxiety, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/depression/index.html" id="mol-9c1ab490-0e4a-11f0-b85f-af5a12500c95" class=""&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and even the progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This link between sleep and stress can also interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps your body sleep properly. Low amounts of melatonin can lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts note that the sleeping on your side is the best position but when under stress, you may contort yourself into positions such as the Flamingo or Mountain Climber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the common sleeping positions Dr Osbourne says are clear indicators of the body and mind being in stress: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;This link between sleep and stress can also interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps your body sleep properly and lead to sleep disorders such as insomnia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Mummy &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly to a mummy in a burial shroud, this style refers to lying flat on the back with the legs extended straight out and the arms crossed over the chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the mummy style of sleeping can help reduce snoring, sleep apnea and improve spinal alignment, sleeping stiffly with your arms crossed over your chest can also indicate you're feeling anxious, defensive or frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your arm position may also show a yearning for comfort or a subconscious attempt to protect oneself, potentially suggesting underlying stress or anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Tree-Climber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also known as the spread-out position, the tree-climber involves lying on your stomach with your arms extended up at 90 degrees and one of your legs pulled upward also at 90 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At times, underlying stress can cause muscle tension, making it difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position and forcing a person to resort to sleeping on their stomach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this can worsen previous health conditions such as snoring, sleep apnea aggravation, back or neck pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Kyle Osbourne, a clinical psychologist at Ancora Psychiatric Hospital, Philadelphia, recently noted that stress and sleep quality are closely linked, with stress impacting sleep and poor sleep exacerbating stress&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist explained to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sleep-newzzz/201903/your-sleep-position-affects-much-more-than-you-think#:~:text=What%20are%20the%20downsides%20of,lead%20to%20less%20restful%20sleep."&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'Stomach sleeping can be hard on your back and neck, causing additional pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's because when you're stretched out on your stomach, it's practically impossible to keep your spine and neck aligned and not under pressure. Your neck is turned at a 90-degree angle from the rest of your body and elevated by your pillow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's a recipe for neck pain and strain. Sleeping on your stomach causes a pronounced curve in your spine - it's sort of like sleeping in a back bend all night - which puts pressure on your lower back and can cause pain and stiffness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Stomach sleeping also pushes your face into your pillow, which can lead to more wrinkles and signs of aging.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, sleeping with your arms at angle that leaves them above your head can lead to numbness or tingling in your hands or arms due to pressure on nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Pillow Stacker &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While having all your favorite pillows under your neck may give you comfort and help your acid reflux, it can cause stress, fatigue and mental health issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifting your head too much or using too many pillows can lead to neck ache, which can affect sleep quality and cause discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor night's sleep increases fatigue and a lack of energy, which can cause irritability and affect your mental health in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, a prolonged lack of sleep can also lead to a range of health issues, including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease as well as impaired immune function and cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests that sleeping with just one pillow is best as it raises the head only slightly so that both the head and neck are aligned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of 2025, about 70 percent of Americans say they usually sleep on their sides, 19 percent on their backs and 12 percent on their stomachs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Fetal position&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The baby, or fetal sleep position, is where a person sleeps on their side with their legs curled up and their arms either hugged around them or kept close to the chest - mimicking the position of a fetus in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the posture can improve blood circulation, it may indicate sensitivity and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When faced with extreme stress, our bodies naturally resort to the 'self-soothing' fetal position, much like an infant would - suggesting that person may be unconsciously  self-soothing themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wellandgood.com/lifestyle/what-does-your-sleeping-position-mean-mental-health"&gt; Dr Aarti Grover&lt;/a&gt;, Medical Director for the Center for Sleep at Tufts Medical Center: 'Sleeping in the fetal position has been associated with people who have anxiety and need comfort.' &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the position can also cause knee pain as the ligaments around the knees and hips become inflamed due to the constant flexion occurring at those joints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prolonged, elevated cortisol levels or chronic stress can disrupt these processes, leading to inflammation, chronic pain, anxiety, depression and even the progression of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;The Flamingo &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This sleeping position is when a person sleeps on their back with one leg bent and pulled towards the body while the other remains straight - how a flamingo sleeps in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While some people find this position comfortable and relaxing as it can help with spinal alignment and reduce pressure on certain areas, others believe it is a sign of heightened stress or nervous system activity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, there is limited scientific evidence to support this claim. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Apart from this, sleeping on your back can potentially lead to snoring and sleep apnea. At times, it may also cause acid reflux. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Lois Krahn, a Mayo Clinic sleep specialist explained: 'I know many people find it to be comfortable, because they're not putting weight on their joints. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Sleeping on the back means that your tongue and jaw can fall down and crowd your airway. And many people snore more on their back.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Symptoms initially resemble the flu (fever, headache, weakness) but progress to neurological issues such as confusion, hallucinations, paralysis, hydrophobia (fear of water), and eventually coma and death. Fewer than 20 people have ever survived rabies after symptoms presented, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Around 10 people die from rabies in the U.S. each year, the CDC estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of U.S. rabies cases are a result of exposure to bats, raccoons, skunks and foxes.

In a statement, the CDC said that the organ donor was exposed to rabies from a wild animal in Idaho five weeks before they died and their organ was transplanted, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/michigan-resident-dies-rabies-after-undergoing-organ-transplant/story?id=120217114" target="_blank" data-url="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/michigan-resident-dies-rabies-after-undergoing-organ-transplant/story?id=120217114" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ABC News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The donor had not died with "traditional rabies symptoms," and they had not sought out medical help or notified public health officials after their exposure to the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an animal bite, rabies can be prevented with post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). This includes immediately washing the wound with soap and water for at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/when-to-seek-care/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/when-to-seek-care/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;least 15 minutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/prevention-recommendations/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/hcp/prevention-recommendations/post-exposure-prophylaxis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;receiving four or five doses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the rabies vaccine over the course of 14 days after the bite. The vaccine helps the immune system produce antibodies against the rabies virus. If the person has never been vaccinated against rabies, they will also receive rabies immune globulin (RIG) on the day of the bite, which provides immediate passive immunity while the vaccine triggers the body's own immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/php/protecting-public-health/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;800,000 people&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; receive rabies-related medical care from local or state health departments around the U.S. every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several cases of rabies being contracted from a transplanted organ have been reported in the past.

However, donors are excluded if they report having rabies or show any visible symptoms of rabies infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MDHHS noted that all health care providers and anyone else exposed to the Michigan transplant patient have been assessed for rabies exposure and given PEP if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

Brain volume decreases, for example, and neural connections may weaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IDGD7BX4SZELPNI7QBW2IVUU3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These physical changes help explain the mental shifts that often come with aging, making it harder to recall a word or learn a new task. The risk of developing dementia — an umbrella term that includes Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia and more — rises with age, too. But there are simple habits that can reduce your risk of memory loss and dementia — and slow cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2IMLNJTAYJECZP4KGP5YFRSF6Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Think about risks and protective factors on a seesaw,” says Joel Salinas, a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City. “Your risk on one side and things that protect you against that risk” on the other. Even if you have a significant family history of dementia, for example, “there’s just so much you can do on the protective side of the seesaw to balance it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUQUS6ZDQBCHFIHBFA23ZGKTJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nearly half of all dementia cases worldwide could be delayed or prevented altogether by making lifestyle and environmental changes, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01296-0/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;2024 report published in the journal the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;. These same practices — which include regular physical activity, a balanced diet, stress management and good sleep — can help slow the cognitive symptoms that come with normal aging. And recent research highlights other ways you can reduce your risk of dementia and promote healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="CNHP5QS53JECXBLQCBATAFHKNQ"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key activities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="C42XBRMFLBFWBPTHH5UJSJQBIM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exercise regularly.&lt;/b&gt; Staying active enhances cognitive fitness in addition to physical fitness. People who engage in regular exercise have larger brain volumes than those who don’t. And a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9163715/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review of 58 studies&lt;/a&gt; found that physical activity was linked to a decreased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WQ7NTHVXNJDGLFNH3GMZLDXZHM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Even mild to moderate activity has an effect,” says Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry, neurology, and gerontology at the Keck School of Medicine and Leonard Davis School of Gerontology of the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WK23S3PSRJFXVLUFUHSVLN6E5M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Of all my patients, those who have very structured and consistent exercise routines are the ones who tend to do the best,” Salinas says.

Other research suggests that — for thinking and memory — the MIND diet may be more beneficial than other diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="RT5N6WTOUFCX3FKRA6W5QK43YI" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="RT5N6WTOUFCX3FKRA6W5QK43YI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A few more helpful steps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X64D5FLJMJCIPIYSN5BJ3C25WA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Emerging research has revealed some factors in addition to exercise and diet that can make a real difference.

But a growing body of evidence shows that as the severity of hearing loss increases, the risk of developing dementia also rises. Similarly, older adults who experience vision loss have an almost 50 percent higher dementia risk. These declines may also mean less activity in certain brain areas — and often less social interaction and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L7I6TIAX5JHYRLJSXG6ZOBVTVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Research suggests that older adults may be able to slow cognitive decline by using &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/hearing-aids/buying-guide/" target="_blank"&gt;hearing aids&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have revealed exactly how tobacco smoke damages DNA to drive the development of different types of head and neck cancer, a finding that could unlock new treatments and prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-025-02134-0" target="_blank"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; (31 March) in &lt;i&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/i&gt;, the research team showed that the effect of smoking combined with other factors—such as the consumption of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/alcohol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;—could more than double the damaging effect on DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, around 750,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed globally, with about 70% of these cases linked to preventable risk factors such as smoking. While previous research has associated alcohol with these cancers, alcohol in the absence of other risk factors is only responsible for around 4% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when smoking is combined with drinking alcohol, it appears to make the DNA damage from alcohol much worse, increasing the harm by about 2.5 times compared to alcohol alone. Until now, it's not been clear exactly how the consumption of tobacco and alcohol leads to head and neck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team behind the study is made up of scientists from five institutes, including the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study maps the specific molecular scars left by &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tobacco+smoke/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tobacco smoke&lt;/a&gt; in head and neck cancers. By uncovering these unique patterns of DNA damage, we are not just identifying the key factors that lead to cancer formation but also unlocking possibilities for prevention which could help reduce head and neck cancer incidence around the globe," says Dr. Laura Torrens Fontanals.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"Each cancer holds an archaeological trace—a record written in its DNA—of what originally caused it. Sequencing the whole genomes of cancers gives us a powerful lens to look for these archaeological traces, which we see as distinct patterns of damage in the genome. These &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mutational+signatures/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mutational signatures&lt;/a&gt; reveal both known and unknown causes of the cancer and help uncover the lifestyle factors and exposures that lead to varying cancer incidents across the globe," says Professor Sir Mike Stratton.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers, known as the Cancer Grand Challenges Mutographs team, looked at tumor samples from 265 head and neck cancer cases diagnosed in eight countries across Europe and South America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They focused on finding the "fingerprints" of tobacco-related DNA damage within these tumor samples and found six distinct patterns—several of which were previously unknown—and found that these patterns were more prevalent in countries with higher smoking rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the extent of tobacco-induced DNA damage varies depending on the specific location within the head and neck. This suggests that different tissues may respond uniquely to the harmful effects of tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to tobacco and alcohol, the study also looked at ultraviolet (UV) light. While UV light exposure is already a known risk factor for cancers on the lips, the researchers found that it might also contribute to DNA damage in the internal lining of the mouth and saw that smoking and exposure to UV together could further enhance this damage.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;This highlights the way in which multiple environmental factors can interact and compound head and neck cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings deepen understanding of the mechanisms driving head and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neck+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neck cancer&lt;/a&gt;, providing crucial insights into how tobacco smoke, alcohol, and UV light contribute to DNA damage. By pinpointing the exact patterns of this damage, scientists are now better equipped to explore targeted interventions—whether by blocking or repairing damage before cancer fully develops or by refining treatment approaches for those already diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings represent a significant advance in our understanding of how everyday exposures—like smoking and drinking—contribute to cancer development. Not only does this research underscore the critical need for prevention, it also lays the groundwork for developing tailored therapies that address the specific genetic alterations caused by these risk factors," says Dr. David Scott.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It can be missed as a potential ADHD symptom because it looks like intentional laziness and lack of motivation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ADHD Centre says chronic procrastination can lead to problems in the workplace and at home, and it can also take an emotional toll, with feelings of shame, guilt or frustration stemming from not being able to complete simple tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it can be difficult for people with ADHD to start a task, O'Shea says once they do start, they can often find themselves hyperfocusing on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explains: 'Hyperfocus is a symptom that can easily be missed because it looks like the person is only motivated to do certain activities. It's sometimes mistaken as selfishness and overzealousness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Attention Deficit Association says that hyperfocus likely happens due to the way the ADHD brain is wired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It notes: 'A deficiency in dopamine, a chemical messenger of the brain, changes how the ADHD brain perceives reward and manages attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a result, managing your attention can be more difficult, making it easier to slip into hyperfocus.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another lesser-known symptom of undiagnosed ADHD is an out-of-control shopping habit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say impulsive spending could be another sign of ADHD as the disorder impacts impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have indicated that, on average, ADHD-related impulse spending costs individuals around $2,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mareen Dennis, a psychological practitioner with the University of Kentucky Department of Psychiatry, says some of the things people with ADHD can do to prevent impulse spending include using cash only in stores and deleting card and other payment information from online stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Running late all the time could be another subtle indicator you have ADHD, as the condition makes it trickier to keep track of time and focus on getting ready within a certain time frame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining how 'time blindness' might present itself, O'Shea says: 'You might know the exact time of an appointment, but leave the house at that time rather than in advance to give yourself room to travel there, park and sign yourself in.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you suddenly find yourself flying into a rage over a small thing, the experts say this too could be a symptom of ADHD, as the condition makes it difficult to regulate emotions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The experts highlight that ADHD is often linked to abnormal eating patterns because of the inability to plan time well and keep focused on tasks (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, O'Shea notes, is related to the difficulties that can come with managing attention and directing energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regarding the extreme ADHD emotional mood swings, the Attention Deficit Association says: 'Imagine if traffic lights skipped yellow and went straight from green to red without warning - driving under these conditions would be very stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you have ADHD, handling your emotions might feel a bit like this. You may be calm and happy one moment. Then, without any warning, a small trigger can flip your emotions from green to red.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forgetting to eat isn't just because the workday is busy, it could also be a sign of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts highlight ADHD is often linked to abnormal eating patterns because of the inability to plan time well and keep focused on tasks.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, binge eating - when you uncontrollably eat a large amount of food in a short amount of time - is most commonly associated with the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Duke University estimates about 30 percent of adults with binge eating disorder, also have a history of ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Roberto Olivardia, a clinical psychologist who specializes in the treatment of ADHD and eating disorders, says many individuals with the condition are on a 'see food diet... If they see it, they eat it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To overcome this, he suggests portioning meals in advance and practicing mindfulness while eating so you know when to stop when full.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sleep disorders are also linked to ADHD, and the Sleep Foundation reveals that children with the neurological condition are also more likely to experience nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that ADHD-related sleep problems such as insomnia may be 'a side effect of impaired arousal, alertness, and regulation circuits in the brain'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although some studies have suggested that these problems can also be 'traced to a delayed circadian rhythm with a later onset of melatonin production (the sleep hormone).'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On a similar theme, constant restlessness or fidgeting is something experts say to watch out for. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;O'Shea added: 'Adults [with ADHD] are more likely to show restlessness through having to get up and pace around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They might not be able to sit through a movie without talking or getting out their phone.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The restlessness caused by ADHD might also make it more difficult to make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some decisions might be impulsive, others might need more time to process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Touching on why this happens, O'Shea says: 'This is a result of controlling attention well enough to sort through the pros and cons of a decision and remember what you were thinking.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moving to the final subtle sign, the experts say it is important to reflect on how you communicate with others, as this could be an indicator of your brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to increased impulsivity and a lack of ability to regulate emotions, ADHD can make communicating difficult. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients might have difficulties focusing on conversations, actively listening, staying on topic and remembering details discussed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They might also cause offense by interrupting others, speaking before thinking and making regretful statements as their emotions get the better of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're diagnosed with ADHD, the condition can be managed to decrease the severity of symptoms. Many people use medication to help deal with the side effects, with the recommended drugs including stimulants and non-stimulants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthcare providers often prescribe antidepressants, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 17:34:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQSXNLSjJ5LUdleWR0M3BSUC02cllab0J5NDlER1hjWWd1U3pOMkZpVzVJTlFKOXRkdjkzczQ4eWE3U2xFU051ZV84SnBiV0lWY1RiWlo0OWFEVVlHaUQ0WjluY0Z4SE4xWXJFQWE1Tkg0NXo2QjJ5OWVMSU1wT3pmWE1fSDhRM2hMOGVwS05jM3VZWk84bUtv0gGcAUFVX3lxTE5JNFpFODZkV1o4NzlrT1AtRlcwY3pKUVNxVk1SOVpUeVBjaDdreWd2LWoyQnVKbTNqRGlodnlNbG45MVRaZ2RtTERnbkxaTlNnM3diZmo3eXNldXJQTlRmdDlYNFZJNGJIb3dyZ1BtMVhmMjZQWUM1VmJxaVJhTXVJMTRDc0RMS0djZjd1NThQSWxJaEdRaUFSVkdOaQ</guid></item><item><title>Faced with measles, Texas healthcare workers confront ‘information warfare’ - Al Jazeera</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wysiwyg css-mkhf1y"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her work at hospitals or in-home healthcare, Parker explained she has often talked to patients about the importance of vaccines. Some listen. Many don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Parker has seen plenty of misinformation and disinformation over the years, she said the COVID-19 pandemic made matters worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was a petri dish there just waiting for that mess to proliferate,” she said in reference to vaccine scepticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then the right wind came along, and it blew those spores all over the place: the spores of ignorance and misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rekha Lakshmanan observed something similar. She is the chief strategic officer for The Immunization Partnership, a Houston-based nonprofit that aims to eradicate preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She argued that Texas has long been a site of vaccine misinformation. But the pandemic “made the nation catch up with Texas”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False rumours flooded the internet, warning that vaccines could alter DNA or render people infertile. Some conspiracy theories even posited that the vaccine could be used for implanting chips into patients’ bodies for surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all vaccine sceptics believe the misinformation. The way Lakshmanan sees it, vaccine hesitancy falls on a continuum. At the far end, there are those who cannot be convinced to get a vaccine, regardless of the data you present. Unfortunately, she said, that’s the loudest group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, others can be convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to take a step back and see that there’s a bigger part of that continuum that’s parents, and they just have questions,” Lakshmanan said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained that parents are often sifting through reams of misinformation, trying to understand what is real and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the anti-vaccine organisation Children’s Health Defense recently published a website that bore a striking resemblance to materials published by the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But its site was riddled with disinformation about vaccines. Kennedy, who served as a leader at Children’s Health Defense before joining the government, ultimately ordered the organisation to take the site down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The challenge with misinformation is that it could look legit,” Lakshmanan said, “which is why we have to approach these conversations with empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That includes arguments about “parents’ rights”, which she says is entirely misleading. Anti-vaccine leaders like Kennedy have accused the government of forcing vaccination on parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No one has ever said we should take away parents’ rights,” Lakshmanan told Al Jazeera. “It’s a red herring.”&lt;/p&gt;

Then, they were examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain scans, blood samples and hunger ratings before and after consuming the drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/health/severe-obesity-is-on-the-rise-in-the-us-new-research-shows" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Severe obesity is on the rise in the US, new research shows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers said sucralose increased participants’ feelings of hunger and activity in the hypothalamus, a brain region that regulates appetite and body weight. The study found this was more common in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sucralose also changed the way the hypothalamus communicated with other brain regions, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, unlike sugar, sucralose did not increase blood levels of certain hormones that create a feeling of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings show how sucralose confuses the brain by providing a sweet taste without the expected caloric energy,” said Dr.Kathleen Alanna Page, author of the study and director of the USC Diabetes and Obesity Research Institute. “This ‘mismatch’ could even trigger changes in cravings and eating behavior down the line.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RELATED STORY | &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/business/company-news/stephen-curry-and-michelle-obama-collaborate-on-healthier-sports-hydration-drink" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen Curry and Michelle Obama collaborate on 'healthier' sports hydration drink&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newly developed blood test for Alzheimer's disease not only aids in the diagnosis of the neurodegenerative condition but also indicates how far it has progressed, according to a study by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Lund University in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Several blood tests for Alzheimer's disease are already clinically available, including two based on technology licensed from WashU. Such tests help doctors diagnose the disease in people with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+symptoms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, but do not indicate the clinical stage of the disease symptoms—that is, the degree of impairment in thinking or memory due to Alzheimer's dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Alzheimer's therapies are most effective in the early stages of the disease, so having a relatively easy and reliable way to gauge how far the disease has progressed could help doctors determine which patients are likely to benefit from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug+treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug treatment&lt;/a&gt; and to what extent. The new test can also provide insight into whether a person's symptoms are likely due to Alzheimer's versus some other cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers found that levels of a protein called MTBR-tau243 in the blood accurately reflect the amount of toxic accumulation of tau aggregates in the brain and correlate with the severity of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing blood levels of MTBR-tau243 from a group of people with cognitive decline, the researchers were able to distinguish between people with early- or later-stage Alzheimer's disease and separate both groups of Alzheimer's patients from people whose symptoms were caused by something other than Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This blood test clearly identifies Alzheimer's tau tangles, which is our best biomarker measure of Alzheimer's symptoms and dementia," said co-senior author Randall J. Bateman, MD, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In clinical practice right now, we don't have easy or accessible measures of Alzheimer's tangles and dementia, and so a tangle blood test like this can provide a much better indication if the symptoms are due to Alzheimer's and may also help doctors decide which treatments are best for their patients."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Tracking Alzheimer's disease progression from blood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease involves a buildup of a protein, called amyloid, into plaques in the brain, followed by the development of tangles of tau protein years later. Cognitive symptoms emerge around the time tau tangles become detectable, and symptoms worsen as the tangles spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gold standard for staging Alzheimer's disease is positron emission tomography (PET) brain scans for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/amyloid+plaques/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;amyloid plaques&lt;/a&gt; and tau tangles. Amyloid scans yield information about the presymptomatic and early symptomatic stages, while tau scans are useful for tracking later stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PET brain scans are highly accurate but expensive, time-consuming and frequently unavailable outside of major research centers, so they are not widely used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bateman leads a team that is developing blood tests for Alzheimer's disease as a more accessible alternative to brain scans. They have developed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-02-blood-alzheimer-highly-accurate-large.html"&gt;two blood tests&lt;/a&gt; that correlate closely with the amount of amyloid plaques in the brain. Both are now used by doctors to aid diagnosis. But until now, there has been no blood test that reports on tau levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-07-tau-based-biomarker-tracks-alzheimer.html"&gt;In a previous study&lt;/a&gt;, Bateman and colleagues—including co-first authors Kanta Horie, Ph.D., a research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine, and Gemma Salvadó, Ph.D., then a postdoctoral researcher at Lund University, and co-senior author Oskar Hansson, MD, Ph.D., a professor of neurology at Lund University—showed that cerebrospinal fluid levels of MTBR-tau243 correlate closely with tau tangles in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;In the current study, the team extended the analysis to blood. A blood sample is easier to collect than cerebrospinal fluid, which is obtained via spinal tap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a technique to measure MTBR-tau243 levels in people's blood and compared it to the amount of tau tangles in their brains as measured by brain scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They piloted the approach on data from two cohorts: volunteers at WashU Medicine's Charles F. and Joanne Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center, which included 108 people, and a subset of 55 people from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess whether the approach was generalizable, they validated it in an independent dataset consisting of the remaining 739 people in the BioFINDER-2 cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people in the two cohorts represented all but the most severe end of the spectrum of Alzheimer's disease, from the presymptomatic stage when brain amyloid levels are elevated but people remain cognitively healthy, through early-stage disease with mild cognitive impairments, to late symptomatic disease when patients exhibit full-blown dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For comparison, cognitively healthy people with normal amyloid levels, and people with cognitive symptoms due to conditions other than Alzheimer's disease, were included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers' analysis showed that blood MTBR-tau243 levels reflected the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy. MTBR-tau243 levels in the blood were normal in asymptomatic people regardless of amyloid status, meaning that blood MTBR-tau243 levels do not change between healthy people and people in the presymptomatic stage of Alzheimer's disease with amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Among people with cognitive symptoms due to Alzheimer's disease, MTBR-tau243 levels were significantly elevated for people in the mild cognitive impairment phase of Alzheimer's disease and much higher—up to 200 times—for those in the dementia phase. Those differences translated into clear separation of people with early- and late-stage Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, MTBR-tau243 levels were normal in people with cognitive symptoms due to diseases other than Alzheimer's, meaning that the test effectively distinguished Alzheimer's dementia from other kinds of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology underlying the blood test for tau aggregates has been licensed by WashU to C2N Diagnostics, a WashU startup that developed the blood tests for amyloid. These amyloid tests incorporate measures of another form of tau called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I believe we will use blood-based p-tau217 to determine whether an individual has Alzheimer's disease, but MTBR-tau243 will be a highly valuable complement in both clinical settings and research trials," said Hansson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When both of these biomarkers are positive, the likelihood that Alzheimer's is the underlying cause of a person's cognitive symptoms increases significantly, compared to when only p-tau217 is abnormal. This distinction is crucial for selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blood tests could inform personalized Alzheimer's treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Alzheimer's therapies have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to slow progression of the disease, and both work by lowering amyloid levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Horie said the number and variety of available Alzheimer's medications may soon be expanding, as several experimental drugs that target tau or other aspects of Alzheimer's disease are in the pipeline. With blood tests to diagnose and stage the disease, doctors would be able to tailor treatments to the patient's particular disease state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're about to enter the era of personalized medicine for Alzheimer's disease," Horie said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For early stages with low tau tangles, anti-amyloid therapies could be more efficacious than in late stages. But after the onset of dementia with high tau tangles, anti-tau therapy or one of the many other experimental approaches may be more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Once we have a clinically available &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+test/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt; for staging, plus treatments that work at different stages of the disease, doctors will be able to optimize their treatment plans for the specific needs of each patient."&lt;/p&gt;

NIH-funded study reveals variables, such as poverty and education, that may underpin higher rates of heart disease and its risk factors.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) uncovered higher rates of heart disease and worse heart health affecting adults living in rural communities compared to urban areas and the factors that likely drive these differences. They found adults living in rural areas were more likely than those living in large cities to have heart disease (7% vs. 4%), high blood pressure (37% vs. 31%), high cholesterol (29% vs. 27%), obesity (41% vs. 30%), and diabetes (11% vs. 10%). Across all age groups, the differences in high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes were largest among adults ages 20–39 living in rural areas vs. cities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigators reviewed data from more than 27,000 adults who participated in the 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/documentation/2022-nhis.html"&gt;National Health Interview Survey&lt;/a&gt; to understand geographical differences in rates of heart disease and risk factors for conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Since higher rates of heart disease among adults in rural areas compared to cities have been established, they also sought to understand factors driving these variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They found that factors such as levels of income and education, having enough food to eat, and owning a home mostly explained the higher rates of people in rural areas who had high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Prior &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073510971935079X?via%3Dihub"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has also shown how difficult circumstances, such as living in poverty, can affect cardiovascular health, including increasing inflammation in the body. Additionally, having access to healthcare, which is important for overall health, did not factor into these differences. Lifestyle risk factors for heart disease such as smoking and being less active also didn’t explain these differences, although adults living in rural areas were more likely to smoke and be less active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that rates of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease were largest in rural areas compared to cities in the South. Rates of obesity were higher across rural areas throughout the U.S., especially in the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 60 million U.S. adults live in rural communities, and heart disease remains the nation’s leading cause of death. In this study, 1 in 7 adults lived in rural areas (counties of less than 50,000 people), 1 in 2 lived in small or medium-sized cities (counties of 50,000 to less than 1 million people), and 1 in 3 lived in large cities (counties of 1 million or more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying factors driving the higher burden of heart disease and risk factors in rural regions remains a critical research priority. The authors note that insights from their study could inform public health efforts and policies to support and improve the cardiovascular health of people — especially younger adults — living in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grant &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/eCTi0XSs90G8-zMPPpxrsQ/project-details/10938144#description"&gt;R01HL174549&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Oskar Hansson from Lund University, a co-author of the work, said: “There is an urgent need for accurate and cost-effective Alzheimer diagnostics considering that many countries have recently approved the clinical use of amyloid-targeted therapies [such as donanemab and lecanemab].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Plaques of a protein called amyloid beta and the formation of tangles of another protein called tau in the brain are considered hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03617-7" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, Hansson and colleagues reported how they found fragments of tau, called eMTBR-tau243, could be detected in blood and correlated with a build-up of tau tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, but not other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team’s analyses, which involved 902 participants, found levels of this tau fragment were elevated in people with Alzheimer’s symptoms who had mild cognitive impairment, and higher again in those with dementia. Levels were not raised in people with cognitive impairments due to other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Scientifically, these results are very promising and important as this marker performed better than existing tests and the new marker could help track performance of new drugs in trials,” said Prof Tara Spires-Jones, a neurodegeneration expert at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But, she said, it was not a foolproof blood test for Alzheimer’s&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is also not a simple test, rather requiring complex scientific methods only available in specialist laboratories, so this will not be routinely available without further validation and development of cheaper, easier detection,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Dr Sheona Scales, the head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said eMTBR-tau243 was one of a number of different biomarkers being studied for use in blood tests for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“What’s interesting is that the blood levels of eMTBR-tau243 seem to be linked to a person’s memory and thinking abilities,” she said. “At present, it is not always possible to make a connection between the level of tangles observed with imaging and level of cognitive impairment, but having blood tests that do this will help to monitor diseases like Alzheimer’s in the brain as they progress, and help inform prognosis in future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03565-2" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Another piece of research&lt;/a&gt;, also published in Nature Medicine, has revealed the ratio of two proteins in brain fluid is associated with the degree of cognitive impairment experienced by people with Alzheimer’s, independent of levels of amyloid beta plaques and tau tangles in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;This research, led by scientists in the US, involved samples from 3,397 people across the US, Sweden and Finland, and looked at levels of two proteins – YWHAG and NPTX2 – that are normally found at the junctions, or synapses, between neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The team found the ratio of YWHAG:NPTX2 was better able to indicate that people were experiencing cognitive problems than their levels of amyloid beta and tau, and could be used to predict their future cognitive decline and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Prof Tony Wyss-Coray, a co-author of the study from Stanford University, said the results could help identify the best medications for individuals and help design better clinical trials by selecting appropriate participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPZW5mNjBjTXEyNjkwVWY2MjZOenllME1DYUJnUFpqbUQwYjgtS2lPN01hWHlPYVg0SnZ5azloNWRzOHRfTnNnekNncWw2ZG9RZ0NTcDAza295REJ3NVJJeDNqbmkxN2ZaSDdaQjJ0QTBUWWlaS3hNbW45TGR0ZU54M1Y2aThlbFlsVWhpclJTcGYzampwbFpUNWtzUWRndy1oZURN</guid></item><item><title>Why Parents of Kids With ADHD Are So Worried Right Now - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTUJ4RkR1anVqeTZXa2pxMGczbXVpS3I4REtnZ180YmpVMnowOS1rem1xaTVSS3QzcHVFN2NnREhPd0w4ODgtZjVXT2Y1SDdCMTQyb21qdWl4RHBjcF9ESUJUZ2hZYjl0dTlCbnVCc3RCWDVsWTAzeFp3WjVUVzBMZGZ2alFkYldjT3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t18jex008sbbm7xb9qdlc4@published"&gt;For a couple of years, the driving forces of grade school—learning and friendships— were out of reach for Grace’s young daughter. The girl, who has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia, would walk around the classroom, touching and distracting classmates. When she inevitably got in trouble, the child felt embarrassed and anxious, but it was impossible to control the impulsive behaviors. “She could not function in school, at all,” says Grace, who lives in central Oklahoma and whose last name is being withheld, like those of other parents in this article, to protect her daughter’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tno001k3b72mh9ug9k0@published"&gt;That began to change four years ago when the then-6-year-old started on stimulant medications to control her ADHD symptoms. After trying a few, the family found the right fit, and for the first time, learning and friendships felt like a real possibility for the girl.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001l3b724mjutqn2@published"&gt;Now it feels like the hard-won progress—for the girl and for our national understanding of the roughly 1 in 5 American children with neurodivergence—is at grave risk.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001m3b7286k1fzku@published"&gt;Underlying the Trump administration’s Make America Healthy Again campaign, and most particularly a February&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/"&gt; executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling out ADHD medications and other commonly prescribed drugs for children as potential “threats,” is the anti-science implication that neurodivergence is a fiction, curable, as suggested in the executive order, with a well-balanced diet and regular exercise. Parts of the order read a lot like &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5164123-robert-kennedy-jr-psychiatric-drugs-children/"&gt;recent declarations &lt;/a&gt;from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., offering another piece of evidence—as if his &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/03/25/vaccine-skeptic-hhs-rfk-immunization-autism/"&gt;persistent illusions of a link between vaccines and autism &lt;/a&gt;weren’t enough—that the secretary of health and human services believes that scientists and doctors are hurting rather than helping neurodivergent children. President Donald Trump recently announced that &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/parents-educators-worry-as-oversight-of-special-education-is-moved-to-hhs/"&gt;RFK Jr. will oversee special education&lt;/a&gt; for schools, meaning the secretary will now wield enormous influence in how children with disabilities are perceived and treated at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="112" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnp001n3b72sq9ski6z@published"&gt;It’s only in recent decades that it’s been widely understood how rooted the most common neurodivergent conditions like ADHD, autism, and dyslexia are in differences in brain structure or function, or both—and how treatable ADHD, in particular, can be with medications that alter that functioning. “The science of ADHD has shown that it’s a brain-based disorder. It’s not poor discipline; it’s not bad kids,” says Max Wiznitzer, professor of pediatrics and neurology at Case Western Reserve University and co-chair of the professional advisory board of the advocacy organization Children and Adults With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Specifically, for those with ADHD there’s an imbalance in the brain networks associated with attention and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001o3b72dd6n9fr6@published"&gt;To Grace and other parents, the executive order felt like a gut punch, with its implication that bad lifestyle choices can cause ADHD. “It makes me kind of rage honestly,” she says. “If it was that simple to fix without meds, we would have done it. Suggesting that ADHD is a parenting failure rather than a neurological difference is all kinds of messed up.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001p3b72ibhkfw2y@published"&gt;Neurodivergent children are by no means the only group of students with disabilities threatened by the Trump administration’s many wild, devastating actions. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/03/19/us/trump-news"&gt;Efforts to destroy&lt;/a&gt; the Department of Education could &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/403596/what-dismantling-the-education-department-means-for-kids-with-disabilities"&gt;decimate services and advocacy&lt;/a&gt; for students with disabilities ranging from deafness and blindness to learning and intellectual disabilities to all manner of neurodivergence, hurting students of color and marginalized children the most. Severe cuts to Medicaid will make it nearly impossible for lower-income families to access vital services and supports, starting at birth when extremely &lt;a href="https://hechingerreport.org/parents-of-premature-babies-struggle-to-get-help-their-children-are-entitled-to/"&gt;premature babies are automatically eligible&lt;/a&gt; for critical therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001q3b729740xwui@published"&gt;Yet it is notably with neurodivergent children, and those with mood disorders like depression, that the country’s leaders appear to be attacking the very essence and scientific understanding of disability. Repeatedly, RFK Jr. suggested before his appointment that children taking illegal narcotics, as well as ones prescribed ADHD stimulants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, could be well-served on “healing camps” or “wellness farms” where they would essentially be reparented—cut off from the corrupting influences of modern life and, it seems, modern medicine. Last year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-maha-mental-health-wellness-farms.html"&gt;a recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the Cut, Kennedy claimed on a podcast that these farms could be particularly useful for Black children, saying, “Every Black kid is now just standard put on Adderall, on SSRIs, benzos.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnq001r3b72bkrr1icj@published"&gt;The executive order singled out ADHD stimulant medications such as Ritalin and Adderall, which aim to increase brain activity in areas related to attention and impulsivity. (Many children also take nonstimulants, which expand the levels of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that promotes focus and impulse control.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="44" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001s3b726obkqfm9@published"&gt;According to the executive order, the steady rise in diagnosis and use of prescription medications for ADHD among children, along with generally high rates of chronic illness and mental health issues, “poses a dire threat to the American people and our way of life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="49" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001t3b72nlde6p9k@published"&gt;Yet never once does the order use the words &lt;em&gt;brain&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;neurodivergent&lt;/em&gt;, instead lumping disabilities like ADHD and autism in with diseases like asthma, Type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver, arguing that they can be addressed with “fresh thinking on nutrition, physical activity, healthy lifestyles,” and more steps in that same vein.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001u3b72mbbvw1nd@published"&gt;In other words, the administration, or at least the writers of the executive order, do not appear to understand the distinction between a brain variation (that you are born with) and a disease (which you can, indeed, sometimes develop through an unhealthy lifestyle). Wiznitzer notes that all competent pediatricians “encourage good diet. All of us encourage sleep and a healthy lifestyle. But even if you do that with the ADHD population, there is still going to be ADHD.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnr001v3b72ygjoyyuh@published"&gt;“The core symptoms,” he added, “respond best to medication,” with behavior therapy and classroom strategies also helping. But children with strong hyperactivity in particular, he said, most often need some medication to function effectively in school and in life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001w3b72hxs2f6ui@published"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18794206/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that ADHD medications can even alter some of the brain differences in children with the disorder, although Wiznitzer noted that “medicine is just one portion” of treatment and that expanded access to behavioral therapies and classroom support could help reduce some reliance on pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001x3b728nj6ogue@published"&gt;Yet availability of those therapies and supports—like occupational therapy and staff in schools trained in working with children with disabilities, including neurodivergence—could also become even more restricted. Public school districts across the country already were facing severe budget cuts with the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/schools-pandemic-aid-runs-out-00175065"&gt;disappearance of pandemic relief funds&lt;/a&gt;. And now the &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/department-education-cuts-expected-huge-impacts-teachers/story?id=119801563"&gt;slash-and-burn upheaval&lt;/a&gt; at the Department of Education poses more budgetary uncertainty. While cuts could ultimately affect all students with disabilities, those with more mild to moderate disabilities, including many with ADHD, could feel the impact more quickly as schools strive to protect services for those with the most severe needs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001y3b72yzcmwy3j@published"&gt;Children with ADHD are also a (seemingly) unintended target in &lt;a href="https://stateline.org/2025/02/20/gop-led-lawsuit-that-could-dismantle-disability-protections-draws-public-backlash/"&gt;an ongoing lawsuit by the attorney generals in 17 red states&lt;/a&gt; to declare unconstitutional the seminal Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a Civil Rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities by recipients of federal funding. (The stated reason for this challenge was the 2024 inclusion under the Biden administration of gender dysphoria as a protected disability. But experts say a conservative push against federalism in favor of greater states’ rights is also likely at play.)&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tns001z3b72ah88b6fx@published"&gt;Most children with disabilities get special education services in school through an IEP, or an individualized education program. But &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/media/document/crdc-student-disabilities-snapshotpdf-21420.pdf"&gt;more than a million children&lt;/a&gt; who aren’t eligible for an IEP, including countless students with ADHD, get accommodations in school through a 504 plan. In South Carolina, a state that is part of the lawsuit, the attorney general received about 1,000 emails from parents concerned about the possible end of 504 plans, says Mitchell Yell, a professor in special education at the University of South Carolina. “If [the lawsuit] is not thrown out, that would mean a lot of hardship,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnt00203b72zsp97jge@published"&gt;Officials in many of the states have told parents that they are not targeting school 504 plans, but “if Section 504 were declared unconstitutional, it would be catastrophic for people with all types of disabilities,” says Alison Barkoff, a professor at George Washington University, in an email. In regards to potential impact on school 504 plans, she says, “I don’t think they realize they stepped on the mama tiger third rail.”&lt;/p&gt;

At the start of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, behaviors that we would now describe as characterizing ADHD, for instance, were referred to as a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21258430/"&gt;“defect of moral control,”&lt;/a&gt; according to a 2010 review article on the history of the disorder. Although the subject of morality doesn’t come up in the executive order, there’s an implicit morality policing of parents in the suggestion that the real cure to conditions like anxiety and ADHD lies in healthier meals, less screen time, more outdoor activity—ideas perfectly summed up in the vision of those “wellness camps” RFK Jr. has evoked. “It seems to imply that there is something corrupt about these people,” says Wiznitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00223b72kb7ku0pg@published"&gt;In the middle of the century, scientists made the connection between ADHD and the brain, writing that hyperactive behavior in children was caused by “damage” to the organ. That link to the brain was developed and refined over the next few decades. And ADHD, so named, first appeared in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1987 (for a few years before that, it was ADD with or without hyperactivity; and before &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, it was hyperkinetic syndrome of childhood). It wasn’t until the 1990s, though, that doctors came to understand that ADHD is not something that most people necessarily outgrow, says Wiznitzer.&lt;/p&gt;

But in more recent years, there’s been tremendous progress in refining and diversifying the types of medications available, particularly among the nonstimulant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00243b724glhg7vn@published"&gt;Shanna, a New Jersey mother of a 10-year-old who has ADHD and autism, says that at first she was deeply hesitant about putting her then 6-year-old on medication for ADHD. “I really thought we could control this with behavioral therapy,” Shanna recalls. “I don’t think any parent wants to give their kid medication they will be on for the rest of their life.”&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00253b72a1civqrx@published"&gt;But the child wasn’t progressing academically, even with behavior therapy. At one point, a therapist stood near the child in the classroom and tapped her on the shoulder when she wasn’t paying attention. “What she learned is that she didn’t have to pay attention unless they touched her on the shoulder,” Shanna says. The pediatrician reminded the parents, “She has a chemical imbalance in her brain; she’s not going to outgrow this.” That clinched it.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnu00263b72j750v0j8@published"&gt;The parents first tried a stimulant medication, which proved disastrous: It didn’t help the inattention and the child lost 10 percent of her body weight. But the family regrouped and tried a nonstimulant that was more effective. Shanna credits the medication with finally giving her daughter the attention span to learn to read. “The differences were so startling,” she says. “It was shocking how well it worked.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="65" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00273b72xa27xm4t@published"&gt;Parents and pediatricians say no one treatment is a cure-all. Shanna’s daughter continues to receive a variety of in-home therapies for autism and for ADHD. She’s on the same nonstimulant drug she started four years ago. In school, she has several accommodations: Teachers always say the girl’s name first when asking her a question, and she has preferential seating at the front of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00283b72n63usnyu@published"&gt;The family watches the girl’s sleep, activity, and diet closely (they stopped giving her much chocolate years ago, for example, because it made her too excited). But Shanna calls the idea that this monitoring alone—as implied by the executive order—would solve her daughter’s ADHD symptoms “ridiculous.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8t19tnv00293b72up2pjzib@published"&gt;For most kids with neurodivergence, including Shanna’s daughter, a combination of strategies and therapies is crucial to helping them live their best lives. And the prospect of taking a key treatment away from millions of kids, Wiznitzer says, is “like kicking the chair out from under the &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;child.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As SHOT has learned, those infected have been suffering from high fever and severe coughing up blood for weeks, while they have negative tests for Covid and flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The symptoms of those who fall ill are the same: it all starts with the usual aches and weakness, but after a couple of days the virus "cuts down" and it is impossible to get out of bed.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gennady Onishchenko, of the Russian Academy of Sciences, told the Russian news agency TASS: 'In St. Petersburg, we have the Pasteur Institute, which only deals with influenza, and its official report does not contain any information about any new virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Therefore, let's not brush this information aside... [but], most likely, there is no virus, let's not hype it up now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;No infection control measures are reported to have been taken in Russia, while officials are said to be warning that 'spreading unverified information about public health can lead to unnecessary panic'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts outside the country have been unable to verify the reports, but have warned online that the situation in Russia is 'very political'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sharon Sanders, a self-trained disease-tracker who helped track the early days of the Covid pandemic, wrote on her site &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/europe/pneumonia-respiratory-and-influenza-like-illnesses-ili-ac/russia-ad/1010785-russia-mystery-respiratory-virus-reported-in-the-media-gov-suggestion-of-metapneumovirus-march-29-2025"&gt;FluTrackers&lt;/a&gt;: 'Just a reminder... the Russia situation is very political.

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D was similarly effective for reducing disease activity among a subgroup of participants who would’ve been considered to have &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) under newer diagnostic criteria. CIS is a first episode of symptoms that suggests &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results make high-dose vitamin D an interesting candidate for further studies evaluating add-on therapy in the therapeutic strategy for managing MS,” the researchers wrote. The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831270"&gt;&lt;span&gt;High-Dose Vitamin D in Clinically Isolated Syndrome Typical of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system launches mistaken inflammatory attacks on healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord, leading to &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt;, or areas of inflammation and damage. CIS is an initial episode of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; consistent with MS-related inflammation. Some people will never have additional disease activity, but others will go on to have another &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-flares/"&gt;relapse&lt;/a&gt; — a new bout of symptoms — or develop more lesions and will be considered to have converted to MS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the proposed &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;risk factors for MS&lt;/a&gt; are low vitamin D levels, as vitamin D modulates the immune system. Supplementing with vitamin D has been suggested as a way to help ease MS disease activity, but findings have been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phase 3 &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01817166"&gt;D-Lay-MS trial (NCT01817166)&lt;/a&gt; was designed to see if high-dose cholecalciferol could prevent MS conversion from CIS. Cholecalciferol, or vitamin D3, is made by the skin upon sunlight exposure and can be found in certain food sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Vitamin D and disease activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 303 adults, ages 18-55, who’d had a CIS episode in the last three months, but weren’t receiving any &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt; (DMT), were randomly assigned to receive oral high-dose cholecalciferol (100,000 International Units) or a placebo once every two weeks until conversion to MS occurred, or for a maximum of two years. CIS was diagnosed based on the 2010 &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-diagnosis-mcdonald-criteria/"&gt;McDonald Criteria&lt;/a&gt;, a set of diagnostic guidelines for MS. The guidelines were revised in 2017, during the study period, under which 89% of the participants with sufficient data would’ve met the criteria to be &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed&lt;/a&gt; with RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The participants were monitored for disease activity, defined as a new or enlarging lesion, or an active inflammatory lesion identified on &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt;, or a relapse. As &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/09/20/ectrims-2024-high-dose-vitamin-d-delay-progression-ms/"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;, 60.3% of participants on vitamin D and 74.1% on the placebo saw such disease activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average time to the onset of new disease activity was nearly twice as long in the vitamin D group as in the placebo group (432 vs. 224 days), which was a statistically significant difference. The participants taking vitamin D were found to be at a significant, 34% lower risk of disease activity than those on the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All possible signs of MRI disease activity occurred less frequently in the vitamin D group than in the placebo group, including overall MRI activity (57.1% vs. 65.3%), new or enlarging lesions (46.2% vs. 59.2%), and active inflammatory lesions (18.6% vs. 34%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No significant differences were observed with relapses, which occurred in 17.9% of the vitamin D group and 21.8% of the placebo group. Vitamin D also didn’t have a significant impact on measures of disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, or quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the subgroup who fulfilled the 2017 McDonald Criteria for RRMS, vitamin D was similarly associated with a 34% reduced risk of disease activity, suggesting it may also help in early RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who benefited most from vitamin D were those who, at the start of the study, didn’t have spinal cord lesions, had severe vitamin D deficiency, and a normal body mass index, an estimate of body fat based on weight and height.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D treatment was generally safe and well tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings contrast those of a study where vitamin D &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10994527/"&gt;didn’t reduce disease activity&lt;/a&gt; in CIS. Still, the two studies had multiple differences, including in the dosing regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/news-and-magazine/news/d-lay-vitamin-d-results"&gt;news story&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/"&gt;National MS Society&lt;/a&gt; noted that, although study results have been mixed, “it is a good idea to make sure your vitamin D levels match what is recommended for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous clinical trials have also assessed the ability of certain DMTs to prevent disease activity in people with CIS. According to the scientists, vitamin D performed similarly well as those therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that cholecalciferol could represent an inexpensive therapeutic alternative, with low risk of adverse events, after a CIS, especially in populations with limited access to disease-modifying therapies,” wrote the researchers, who noted that vitamin D may be “an ideal candidate” as an add-on therapy to other treatments. They said mo larger and longer studies are still needed to evaluate this.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Need another reason to prioritize your sleep? Not spending enough time in the two deep stages of sleep — slow-wave and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep — may hasten the deterioration of parts of the brain associated with Alzheimer's disease, a new study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50769434" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;slow-wave&lt;/a&gt; and REM sleep appear to shrink parts of the brain known to be early indicators of cognitive deterioration and &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51106201" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, said lead study author Gawon Cho, a postdoctoral associate in internal medicine at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found the volume of a part of the brain called the inferior parietal region shrunk in people with inadequate slow and REM sleep," Cho said. "That part of the brain synthesizes sensory information, including visuospatial information, so it makes sense that it shows neurodegeneration early in the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventive neurologist Dr. Richard Issacson, who established one of the first Alzheimer's prevention clinics in the United States, said in an email that his clinical experience treating adults at risk for Alzheimer's supports the study's findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also found sleep metrics on deeper sleep predicted cognitive function, so between that plus brain volumes, it's real," said Issacson, who is director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens in the brain during deep sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain sweeps out toxins and dead cells while also repairing and restoring the body for the next day. While we dream during REM sleep, the brain is busy processing emotions, consolidating memories and absorbing new information. It makes sense that getting quality deep and REM sleep is key to our ability to function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults need about seven to eight hours of sleep to be healthy, while teens and younger children need much more. However, data shows that more than 1 in 3 American adults don't get enough sleep, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say most adults should spend between 20% and 25% of their night in deep sleep, and the same goes for REM sleep. Older adults require less, while babies need much more — in fact, infants can spend about 50% of their sleep in REM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make matters worse, deeper stages of sleep decrease as you age, Cho said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you get more deep sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep sleep tends to come soon after we fall asleep, while REM sleep appears later in the night, toward morning. Therefore, if you go to bed late and get up early, you are cutting your chances of spending enough time in one or both stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The more time you are in bed, the more a person sleeps, and generally speaking, the longer a person sleeps, the more REM and deep sleep they will get," Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you have to do more than just lay in bed longer — you also need have to have an uninterrupted, restful sleep on a regular basis, experts say. If you do that, there's an additional payoff — a February 2023 study found good sleep habits added nearly five years to a man's life expectancy and almost 2.5 years to a woman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, however, you can't wake up during the night or have trouble falling asleep more than two times a week, the study found. You also have to feel well rested at least five days a week when you wake up. And finally, you can't be using sleep medications to achieve your good slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don't lose hope. The good news is that you can easily train your brain to better sleep by following what is called "sleep hygiene." It's important to go to bed at the same time on most nights and get up at the same time most mornings — even on weekends and holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure your sleeping environment is optimal — cooler and darker is better — and block noise or try a sound machine. Avoid booze before bed — it may seem like you're falling asleep more easily, but when your liver finishes metabolizing the alcohol at 3 a.m., your body will wake up, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up a sleep routine, with no blue lights or distractions at least an hour before bedtime. Try meditation, yoga, tai chi, warm baths — anything that relaxes you is great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How do you make your sleep better? I think people really have to do their part to improve their own sleep," Cho said. "There's no one medicine that improves overall sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ksl-article-content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="qp_all5451291"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qp_main5451291" fp="93084913-162" results="0"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long do you typically sleep at night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

The effect was linked to dietary tryptophan deficiency, which lowers the production of serotonin—a neurotransmitter known to inhibit sexual behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male mice that fasted every other day for months displayed significantly higher mating activity, even into old age, despite no improvements in sperm quality or hormone levels. Researchers suggest similar mechanisms may apply to humans, offering potential insights into non-pharmacological treatments for low libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower Serotonin = Higher Libido:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting reduced serotonin, releasing behavioral inhibition in male mice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased sex drive required fasting for at least 6 weeks, ideally 6 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to fasting-based treatments for low sexual desire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term fasting in 24-hour cycles increases the sex drive of male mice by lowering the concentration of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. This effect is linked to a diet-induced deficiency of the precursor substance tryptophan—an amino acid that must be obtained through food.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from DZNE report on this in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, together with a Chinese team from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108300"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and food." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/intermittent-fasting-male-libido-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;As the scientist notes, it is also possible that the effect could occur under a general caloric restriction, where food is continuously available but in reduced amounts. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They suggest that similar mechanisms may exist in humans and view fasting as a potential approach for treating unwanted loss of sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting is a recurring subject of research because reduced food intake and thus calorie restriction has a variety of effects on the organism beyond the commonly observed weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dan Ehninger, research group leader at DZNE and lead author of the current study, and his team have also been working on this topic for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in the effects of fasting on aging. Using mice as a model, we investigate the underlying biological mechanisms. Our aim is to gain insights that may also be relevant to humans,” says the Bonn-based scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More offspring than expected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research results now published are based on a fortuitous discovery, as Ehninger and his colleagues had originally set out to investigate something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their aim was to examine how fasting affects the offspring of male mice. However, one particular finding steered their research in a new direction: aged male mice—senior individuals by human standards—that had fasted for extended periods produced an unusually large number of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to initial hypotheses, this phenomenon was not due to fasting effects on reproductive organs or the endocrine state of the animals. Age-related changes in the testes, reduced sperm quality and lower testosterone levels, for example, argued against high fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a bit of detective work to uncover the real cause,” says Ehninger, whose research group collaborated on the current study with experts from Qingdao University and the University of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences led by Prof. Yu Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eventually, we realized: it is a matter of behavior. The fasting males had significantly more sexual contacts than mice that could eat freely. In other words, these animals had an unusually high frequency of mating and, as a result, an unusually high number of offspring for their age. Their mating behavior more than compensated for the age-related physiological limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fasting in a 24-hour rhythm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting at two months of age, these male mice were subjected to a specific form of intermittent fasting. Their access to food followed a recurring 24-hour pattern: the animals were allowed to feed ad libitum for 24 hours, followed by 24 hours with access to water only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 22-month fasting regimen, the males were housed together without any contact with females. They were later introduced to three-month-old females that had been raised without dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Effect takes time&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased mating behavior was also observed in younger mice. These males had also started intermittent fasting at the age of two months, but had followed this diet for only six months before being introduced to females. They, too, were more sexually active than age-matched peers that had been fed ad libitum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the effect was absent in other experimental groups—both young and old—that fasted for only a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For intermittent fasting to increase sex drive, it takes some time,” says Zhou. “Based on our experiments, the minimum duration appears to be somewhere between six weeks and six months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A question of serotonin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of investigating the causes, attention eventually turned to neurotransmitters that influence sexual behavior. Some have a stimulating effect, while others act as inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the sexually active male mice, one factor stood out: serotonin—a chemical messenger generally associated with inhibitory effects—was present at unusually low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mice were, so to speak, sexually uninhibited; the usual regulatory restraint was diminished,” says Ehninger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serotonin is primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract, but also in the brain, where it acts as a neurotransmitter mediating communication between neurons. However, its synthesis depends on the amino acid tryptophan, which must be obtained through the diet or released through the breakdown of the body’s own protein stores, such as those found in muscle tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid, meaning that neither mice nor humans can synthesize it on their own. As a result, dietary intake plays a key role in regulating tryptophan levels in the body. It is, in fact, found in many common foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lack of serotonin was clearly a result of fasting,” explains the DZNE researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the fasting regimen relevant?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All in all, the fasting mice consumed almost 15% fewer calories than the animals in the control group. This also roughly applies to their intake of tryptophan,” says Zhou.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, it is currently unclear whether the reduction in serotonin levels is linked to our specific feeding regimen or would also occur with other types of fasting. Future studies will need to clarify this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scientist notes, it is also possible that the effect could occur under a general caloric restriction, where food is continuously available but in reduced amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A potential approach for therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chemical messengers also play an important role in regulating sexual behavior in humans. This applies in particular to serotonin,” says Ehninger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he points out, this is evident, for example, in the use of SSRIs, a class of antidepressant drugs that increase serotonin levels. A potential side effect of this therapy is reduced libido. Conversely, lower serotonin levels are known to promote sexual desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In view of this, I consider it very plausible that sexual desire in humans can be influenced by fasting—possibly not only in men, but also in women, since serotonin affects their libido as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Ehninger, there are actually only a few scientific studies on the effects of fasting on human libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, it would make sense to investigate this in more detail. I see potential for therapeutic applications. A lack of sexual desire is not necessarily perceived as problematic—but some people suffer from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This condition is known as ‘hypoactive sexual desire disorder’ and particularly affects older adults. Fasting could potentially serve as a useful addition to existing treatment options.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and libido research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dan Ehninger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dzne.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Dan Ehninger – DZNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmet.2025.03.001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Intermittent fasting boosts sexual behavior by limiting the central availability of tryptophan and serotonin&lt;/a&gt;” by Dan Ehninger et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermittent fasting boosts sexual behavior by limiting the central availability of tryptophan and serotonin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging affects reproductive capabilities in males through physiological and behavioral alterations, including endocrine changes and decreased libido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the influence of intermittent fasting (IF) on these aging-related declines, using male C57BL/6J mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed that IF significantly preserved reproductive success in aged mice, not by improving traditional reproductive metrics such as sperm quality or endocrine functions but by enhancing mating behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This behavioral improvement was attributed to IF’s ability to counter age-dependent increases in serotonergic inhibition, primarily through the decreased supply of the serotonin precursor tryptophan from the periphery to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research underscores the potential of dietary interventions like IF in mitigating age-associated declines in male reproductive health and suggests a novel approach to managing conditions related to reduced sexual desire, highlighting the complex interplay between diet, metabolism, and reproductive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 14:07:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE9VVXk4RHFxaW1KNjBPR1c5Skt5VC1CcmplalJBaWRzSURnZjFJSTlXSVZoUG5CcHVVcGNnZzFDYWRZNnpGTDdBZVpVUVlBSVl2TzBVNXM2WnBvWmVnazdfbnVLOTRfYmIwNEQ4eDVFT3lENUZhdGROejlCVWVDZ9IBgwFBVV95cUxOYlRidlJQN3I5VWpwU3lKYXhiVlRjNG9zb0V2YlFLb2RPYnpfWjlGaXBvNWR6TThSZzMyVncwOTNEWk9sNWk3UDAxR29faXJicTJsMkE2VnpLVUJOdEJXc3l0MEk0NXpQWi1TYVp1QVJCcXlFUFFsN3JBMGExTTZINkdndw</guid></item><item><title>As avoidable deaths slowed globally, they rose in the U.S. - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPN2g4eWp2SmlwNGVsd013elJjbm9yV2I5WFhXc1I0aTBEbXBBYnRROFpDTGRqYzI4Q012UjZfSU1CQnZ0WnI5cmItTVNMcVdTNWlFMS1ha3pQd25iZnBnbzgzNUczT21TcUpwRnRMQmgwNEN0c25DMW50TmFhU1I0am9XaWtBcF9CYVRnWFlKYlRZOGs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="47D2P73BMFCPLCIHJG4RWJWGWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;From 2009 to 2019, avoidable mortality increased by an average of 33 deaths per 100,000 people across the United States, according to an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831735" target="_blank"&gt;article published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VJ4FZMAWFJBPDL3WBL4GOVB3HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In the same decade that avoidable deaths increased in the United States, they dropped by an average of nearly 23 deaths per 100,000 across all other countries in the study.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As a registered dietitian, I’m often asked what my favorite snacks are—not because my friends and clients are curious about what I eat (although some are) but because they’re overwhelmed by the options. There are more snack products, especially in the high-protein category, than ever before. While variety is good, it can be exhausting navigating the nutrition information and front-of-package claims. For that reason, I’m always happy to share my favorite snacks, especially from my favorite stores, like Trader Joe’s. I love their bags of nuts and cans of tuna, but if I’m looking for a satisfying high-protein snack, I always grab their Mediterranean Style Hummus Snack Pack with Pita Chips.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re like me and always hungry, it’s nice to have a portable snack that you can carry with you when you’re on the move. I’ve enjoyed hummus as a snack for years, but it never made sense to carry a container of it in my lunch or snack bag. I portion it into little jars when I have time, but more often than not, I’m grabbing my snack as I’m running out the door. That’s why I love the convenience of Trader Joe’s pre-portioned packages of hummus and pita chips, which are perfectly sized and satisfying. The crunchy pita chips are a great way to scoop and enjoy every bite of that protein-packed hummus! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-protein-in-snacks-works"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Protein in Snacks Works &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All nutrients are important and necessary for fueling your body and keeping it healthy. That’s why consuming a variety of foods is essential. But when it comes to snacking, I always recommend something with protein. Protein prompts the release of certain hormones, like cholecystokinin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and decreases the release of others, like ghrelin, to help slow digestion and reduce appetite.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This means that a snack with protein is usually more satisfying than one without. The hummus and pita chips snack pack from Trader Joe’s has 9 grams of protein, thanks to the combination of pita chips and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7913550/are-chickpeas-healthy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;garbanzo beans&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-protein-benefits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Protein Benefits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is one of three macronutrients (carbohydrates and fat are the other two) essential for providing energy. It’s made up of amino acids, which are the “building blocks” responsible for and involved in almost every function in our bodies, from growing and repairing muscle and bone to transporting nutrients. Protein is found in a variety of foods, including both animals and plants. The amount of protein your body needs depends on age, gender, activity level and health. The 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults 19 and older consume 10% to 35% of their daily calories from protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For frame of reference, that’s about 200 to 700 calories from protein for a 2,000-calorie diet.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-makes-something-a-good-high-protein-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Makes Something a Good High-Protein Snack? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are plenty of ways to build a high-protein snack. Fortunately many of them are nourishing and delicious. Direct food sources of protein are easy and straight-forward. You can start with thinking of the food groups. Dairy, eggs, meat, seafood, nuts, seeds, tofu, beans and lentils are all sources of protein. If your diet allows it, choose something from those categories, since a serving provides anywhere from 7 grams to upward of 25 grams of protein, with meat and seafood supplying the most for a 3-ounce portion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If a bar or other prepared snack is your preference, you’ll have to do a bit of reading before you buy. Many snacks, especially protein bars and granola bars, are high in added sugar and refined grains. To find a good snack, start with the Nutrition Facts panel, and look at the protein and added sugar. Go for a snack or bar with at least 7 grams of protein and less than 8 grams of added sugar. Next, review the ingredient list and opt for something made with whole grains versus refined grains—you’ll get more nutrients like fiber and B vitamins. And if you’re sensitive to artificial sweeteners, artificial flavors and preservatives, review the ingredient list for those and choose accordingly.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The best time to enjoy a high-protein snack is between meals, before you get too ravenous. Usually a few hours after a meal is a good rule of thumb, but also listen to your body. If your meal was small or maybe didn’t provide enough nutrition, you may need something earlier. Or if your meal was large or something high in fiber and protein, you can wait a bit longer. Remember that a snack is smaller than a meal and should be satisfying enough to help get you to your next meal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many of us enjoy snacks between meals, they can also be a crucial step in recovery after exercise, says cookbook author and sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://danawhitenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dana Angelo White, M.S., RDN, ATC&lt;/a&gt;. She adds that a “balanced snack always benefits from some protein to help keep you feeling satisfied and energized.” Hummus, like my favorite from Trader Joe’s, is a great option, but White also recommends snacks like smoothies, yogurt bowls made with plain Greek yogurt, or a meat or peanut butter and jelly sandwich, which “are easy and effective foods that offer up protein and deliciousness—both are important!” But remember, says White,“It’s best to spread out protein intake throughout the day. Making sure most meals and snacks have a sensible amount of protein makes the task a lot easier.”  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to a snack that satisfies, choose something with a bit of protein. Keep things easy and try a handful of nuts or some cheese and whole-grain crackers. And if you happen to be at Trader Joe’s, grab their Mediterranean Style Hummus Snack Pack with Pita Chips!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday — it’s Sarah subbing in. A colleague at one of my old jobs used to love using the icebreaker, “Would you rather be a dog or a ghost?” (H/T &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/dog-or-ghost-party-question" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.gq.com/story/dog-or-ghost-party-question" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;GQ&lt;/a&gt;.)

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-to-know-about-top-fda-vaccine-official-s-ouster"&gt;What to know about top FDA vaccine official’s ouster &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Peter Marks resigned from his post as the FDA’s top vaccine regulator Friday after Trump administration officials told him it was that or be fired. Public health experts, former FDA commissioners, and biotech executives alike &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/fda-peter-marks-cber-director-resigns-rfk-jr/" rel=""&gt;are alarmed by Marks’ ouster and what it portends&lt;/a&gt; about containing infectious disease given health secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s anti-vaccine agenda. “[I]t has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,” Marks wrote in his resignation letter, saying Kennedy has undermined confidence in vaccines at a time when &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-400-cases-five-states/" rel=""&gt;measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; are growing across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/fda-peter-marks-cber-director-resigns-rfk-jr/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; from a deep bench of STAT reporters on Marks’ resignation and reactions across the health and life sciences communities, including the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/29/fda-peter-marks-ouster-alarms-biopharma-that-saw-him-as-ally/" rel=""&gt;pharma and biotech execs&lt;/a&gt; who had mostly stayed quiet about the new administration till now. From the CEO of Ovid Therapeutics: Marks’ letter “signals that the very infrastructure we rely on to evaluate, approve, and monitor life-saving medicines — and to protect patients from harm — is at risk of collapse.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-texas-measles-cases-jump-20"&gt;Texas measles cases jump 20%&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speaking of measles, the outbreak in Texas is &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-400-cases-five-states/" rel=""&gt;getting worse&lt;/a&gt;. Officials said they had identified 400 cases as of Friday, primarily in the western part of the state, a 20% jump from 327 cases just a few days prior on March 25. Outbreaks are also underway in New Mexico (44 cases), Kansas (23 cases), Oklahoma (9 cases), and Ohio (10 cases). The CDC defines outbreaks as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news comes as &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/rfk-jr-hhs-measles-outbreak-infant-formula-plan-criticism-fda-scott-gottlieb/?utm_campaign=rss" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/20/rfk-jr-hhs-measles-outbreak-infant-formula-plan-criticism-fda-scott-gottlieb/?utm_campaign=rss" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;alarm grows among public health experts&lt;/a&gt; over HHS secretary Kennedy’s response to the outbreak, including his suggestion that things like vitamin A and cod liver oil could be effective treatments for measles. Recent federal cuts have impacted people who &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/trump-cuts-local-public-health-departments/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/trump-cuts-local-public-health-departments/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;track the spread&lt;/a&gt; of measles and other infectious diseases, and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/vaccine-hestitancy-research-nih-canceled-mental-illness/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/vaccine-hestitancy-research-nih-canceled-mental-illness/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;canceled grants&lt;/a&gt; include research on vaccine hesitancy. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/28/texas-measles-outbreak-400-cases-five-states/" rel=""&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fda-clears-at-home-test-for-three-stis"&gt;FDA clears at-home test for three STIs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/prevalence-incidence-and-cost-estimates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.cdc.gov/sti/php/communication-resources/prevalence-incidence-and-cost-estimates.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;one in five people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. have a sexually transmitted infection on any given day. But people may put off going to the doctor’s office to get checked out, whether because of the anxiety and &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/30/syphilis-rates-climbing-stigma/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2024/05/30/syphilis-rates-climbing-stigma/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;stigma&lt;/a&gt; that’s still associated with STIs or other barriers to care. Many public health experts see at-home tests as a promising way to curb the spread of infections and help people get the treatment they need — an alternative that’s made further gains with the FDA authorization on Friday of an at-home test for chlamydia, gonorrhea and trichomoniasis from Visby Medical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The kit, which is meant for women, includes a vaginal swab for collecting a sample as well as a testing device that provides results within 30 minutes, and can be purchased without a prescription. The FDA authorization follows its 2023 clearance of an &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/15/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-home-test-fda-approval/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2023/11/15/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-home-test-fda-approval/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;at-home test&lt;/a&gt; for chlamydia and gonorrhea, although that test required people to send their samples to a laboratory in order to get results. The agency also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/08/16/syphilis-test-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/08/16/syphilis-test-at-home/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; an at-home test for &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/12/std-rates-syphilis-and-gonorrhea-cases-fall-in-u-s/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/12/std-rates-syphilis-and-gonorrhea-cases-fall-in-u-s/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;syphilis&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-differences-between-men-s-and-women-s-hearts"&gt;The differences between men’s and women’s hearts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29459463/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29459463/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;look different in women&lt;/a&gt; — rather than clutching their chests, as men stereotypically do, they may experience more diffuse pain shooting through their jaw, neck, arm, back, and stomach. That’s just one of the myriad sex and gender differences in cardiovascular disease that researchers have discovered, from risk factors to the number and function of muscle cells in the heart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a moment when research into women’s health is under threat in the United States as a casualty of the Trump administration’s attack on diversity efforts, researchers are worried that this kind of potentially lifesaving progress may be stymied. &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/heart-disease-women-dei-bans-threaten-research-sex-differences-in-cardiovascular-disease/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/heart-disease-women-dei-bans-threaten-research-sex-differences-in-cardiovascular-disease/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;Read more from Liz Cooney&lt;/a&gt; on what we’ve learned about women and heart disease in recent years, and where experts say we should focus next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-end-of-cadavers-in-medical-school-training"&gt;The end of cadavers in medical school training&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More medical schools are phasing out the use of cadavers in favor of virtual reality and other 3-D visualization tools. That means future doctors will lose out on a valuable education about being comfortable in the presence of death, according to First Opinion writer and medical student Nadir Al-Saidi.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Coming face-to-face with a body in that raw state was one of the most powerful moments of my first year in medical school,” Al-Saidi writes of an early encounter with a cadaver. “It taught me reverence and the gravity of what it means to choose this path in health care.” &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/medical-school-cadaver-lab-body-donation-technology-substitute/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/31/medical-school-cadaver-lab-body-donation-technology-substitute/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;Read more&lt;/a&gt; — and if you want to learn more about the long and ethically complicated history of cadavers in medical training as well as in uses like crash testing, check out Mary Roach’s 2006 book “&lt;a href="https://maryroach.net/stiff.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://maryroach.net/stiff.html" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;Stiff&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-already-rare-cardiac-deaths-during-marathons-have-fallen"&gt;Already rare, cardiac deaths during marathons have fallen&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just in time for spring marathons, we have a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.3026?guestAccessKey=1590ae63-6f44-4e97-8268-ca336f122100&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=033025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.3026?guestAccessKey=1590ae63-6f44-4e97-8268-ca336f122100&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=033025" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;study published Sunday in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; updating the infrequent but alarming incidence of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/14/sudden-cardiac-arrest-research-cardiovascular-risk-factors-improve-survival-rate/" rel="" data-stringify-link="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/14/sudden-cardiac-arrest-research-cardiovascular-risk-factors-improve-survival-rate/" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt; among runners. It’s quite rare that someone’s heart will stop beating on the race course, and even rarer that they will die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news: The death rate fell by nearly half in a recent case series from 2010 through 2023 compared to rates gleaned in an initial study conducted the decade before. There were 59 deaths and 117 survivors for a case fatality rate of 34%, down from 71%&lt;strong data-stringify-type="bold"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the earlier timeframe. Incidence was stable, which means among more than 29 million competitors in full and half-marathons — triple the participants reported in the initial &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1106468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1106468" data-sk="tooltip_parent"&gt;RACER study&lt;/a&gt; — there were 176 cardiac arrests, most among men, most during a marathon and most after the 20-mile point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why the change? The authors point to CPR and AEDs on the course. Every runner in cardiac arrest got resuscitation and most had access to a defibrillator to shock their hearts back into rhythm. That puts race routes on a par with airports and casinos for AED availability. &lt;em&gt;— Liz Cooney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
