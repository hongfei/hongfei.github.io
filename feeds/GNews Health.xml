        &lt;p&gt;Want to visualize radioactive particles? You don’t need a boatload of lab equipment. Just a cloud chamber. And [Curious Scientist] is showing off an &lt;a href="https://curiousscientist.tech/blog/diy-cloud-chamber-with-hv-grid" target="_blank"&gt;improved miniature cloud chamber&lt;/a&gt; that is easy to replicate using a 3D printer and common components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The build uses a Peltier module, a CPU cooler, an aluminum plate, thermal paste, and headlight film. The high voltage comes from a sacrificed mosquito swatter. The power input for the whole system is any 12V supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud chamber was high tech back in 1911 when physicist Charles T. R. Wilson made ionizing radiation visible by creating trails of tiny liquid droplets in a supersaturated vapor of alcohol or water. Charged particles pass through, leaving visible condensation trails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-885801"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the post, the cost of everything is under $100. He hasn’t made the 3D printed parts freely available, but there are enough pictures that you can probably work it out yourself. Besides, you’d almost certainly have to rework it for your particular jar, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, a cloud chamber’s construction isn’t a state secret. We’ve seen some fancy &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/08/09/desk-top-peltier-powered-cloud-chamber-uses-desktop-parts/"&gt;Peltier-based designs&lt;/a&gt;. If you manage your expectations, you can build one for even less using a &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/02/11/maybe-the-simplest-cloud-chamber/"&gt;plastic bottle and ingenuity.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	            &lt;/div&gt;

He loves his humans and life in general, and as far as Golden Retrievers go, he’s as loyal as they come. Anyone who meets Boone can tell instantly that he takes his role as a family member very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine his surprise when his family betrayed that loyalty by having a backyard photo shoot without him. There they were, dressed nicely and standing arm in arm in front of the &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-loses-ball-bushes-120000740.html" data-ylk="slk:bushes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link rapid-noclick-resp yahoo-link"&gt;bushes&lt;/a&gt;—and where was 5-year-old Boone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the house, dramatically making a scene in the window for all to see! Boone made sure his humans could not miss how he was feeling about the obvious oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluffy Golden Retriever spotted his humans out in the yard and clearly felt like he belonged out there, too. He propped himself up at the &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news/goldendoodle-conducts-neighborhood-trash-truck-watch" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:window;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;window &lt;/a&gt;and performed his best air bicycle routine against the glass, desperately trying to get their attention.

You forgot me!” or “How dare you leave me out of the photo—I make everything better!” And he’s not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let's Check in With the Comment Section&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TikTok video, recently shared by @golden_boy_boone, quickly captured viewers’ attention. Many of the Golden Retriever’s fans were flabbergasted that he’d intentionally been left out of the portrait. @blah asked, “Now, why would you leave him out?” while @feegs23 summed it up perfectly with a simple, “How rude!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several of Boone’s fellow four-legged TikTok stars also took his side. @RebaandDolly declared, “Rude! Your family photo is missing the main character!” while @Mygoldennuggettito exclaimed, “What!!! Get him out there now!!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite not being in the actual photo, Boone let everyone know that he was the star of the show, nonetheless!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news/golden-retriever-left-out-of-family-photo-everyone-upset" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PawNation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PawNation&lt;/a&gt; on Dec 20, 2025, where it first appeared in the &lt;a href="https://pawnation.com/news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt; section.

There are questions about what happens over Christmas when everyone meets up and it's easier for the virus to infect older people who are more at risk. There are also signs a different strain of flu - H1N1 - is picking up in Europe and may lead to an increase in cases here too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But a "broadly typical flu season" is probably not the sense you'd get from watching or reading the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Statistical artistry was used to compare an early flu season to one that started much later allowing claims of flu cases being &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/2025/12/nhs-ready-double-whammy-winter-fludemic-strikes/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;"an incredible 10 times higher"&lt;/a&gt; than in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It was technically true, but is like saying your train to Glasgow got you there in record time… but the journey time was identical, you just booked an earlier train. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;NHS England was not the first organisation to start calling it superflu, but Prof Meghana Pandit, national medical director at NHS England, did label it an "&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8r30787e76o" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;unprecedented wave of super flu&lt;/a&gt;". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It has been suggested by the British Medical Association that flu has been used to scaremonger while resident doctors were deciding whether to continue their strike action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Superflu isn't a scientific description and the BBC Health Team has not found any expert who thinks it is an accurate one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I don't think it's a helpful term, there isn't a particularly unusual set of symptoms, there's no indication of it being associated with exceptional severity, exceptionally rapid spread or exceptional health impact," says Prof Fraser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One of the UK's top flu scientists, Prof Nicola Lewis, the director of the World Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, said the virus was "not particularly unusual" and that she saw "no evidence" the virus was "particularly different" and superflu "wouldn't be my description".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The former deputy chief medical officer for England through the pandemic, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7405275742994919424/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7405275742994919424%2C7405516492009676800%29&amp;amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7405275742994919424%2C7406388088220065792%29&amp;amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287405516492009676800%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7405275742994919424%29&amp;amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287406388088220065792%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7405275742994919424%29" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt;: "I'm very unclear what is meant by the rather silly term of 'superflu'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Crying wolf?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Persuading people to get the flu vaccine saves lives and last winter the jabs were estimated to have kept around 100,000 people &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-prevented-around-100000-hospital-admissions" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;out of hospital&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, experts have started to question whether the escalation in language used since the Covid pandemic could harm trust in official health advice. Previous winters came with warnings of a tripledemic of flu, Covid and RSV; then it was upgraded to a quademic adding in norovirus; this year it's superflu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Simon Williams, who researches psychology and public health at Swansea University, says there are issues with the "current language around every winter being 'the worst' in some way or another" and risks a "cry wolf" effect that damages trust and means people become "numb" to the advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said there was a danger of "over-using the narrative that viruses will overwhelm the NHS" when "ultimately the NHS hasn't got overwhelmed to the point of not being able to carry out emergency and basic functions".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Instead he argues a "fine balance" is needed between raising awareness and "not falling into the trap of fear-messaging or being overly alarmist, which can backfire".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University, agrees saying: "I think it is a concern to use words like super flu, when we may one day experience a real super flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have to be very, very careful about how we communicate these things to the public, because there is a risk that we can cry wolf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 00:06:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5tSUo1a2tSTFFDTzVSLTZSSDJlUWxzVTNnZU9ZczdvbEZOZHRtZXN6MlY2UUs2TkVmWTRtc3JvTm1ZeFJibnZwRWJZTXV2OVRTd1dvd3FiOGliZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE9ncGlJaU55Rm9xR3dHS1JIZmpVTkJUN0lCNmd6UFllOWJZM19nSFo3cVdCYXZtSGl0UlQ0RUJZNy1VNUFSTG5NdmlRUXFyc1RyTEtQeEdBSGplWE1lUUR3</guid></item><item><title>新研究表明，随着年龄的增长，这种早晨的习惯可以支持您的骨骼健康- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/tea-bone-health-study-11873585</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests morning tea drinkers may have stronger bones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tea is linked to improved bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study excluded decaffeinated or herbal tea, but included all other varieties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis seems to be one of those often overlooked conditions that takes a back seat to more urgent ones, like heart disease and cancer. But in the bigger health picture, osteoporosis can also impact quality of life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Osteoporosis is a disease that develops when your bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mass decrease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s often referred to as a "silent" disease because it typically has no symptoms—until you break a bone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The risk of osteoporosis increases with age, especially after menopause. Based on the latest data, about 13% of U.S. adults over 50 were diagnosed with osteoporosis; this number jumps to almost 18% for those 65 and over.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If we consider just women, 13% of those in the 50 to 64 age bracket had osteoporosis, and 27% of those aged 65 and over had the disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many factors influence one’s risk for osteoporosis, many of them lifestyle-related. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercises-women-over-50-for-strong-bones-11833636" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight-bearing exercise&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-gaining-muscle-mass-11750809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; and walking, may help prevent osteoporosis. Smoking and heavy alcohol use increase your risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And of course, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-for-bone-health-11745664" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;what you eat also plays a role in bone health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we know that foods, like dairy, are rich in bone-supporting nutrients, including calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and vitamin D, some beverages have not yet locked in their bone-health status. Take coffee and tea, for example. Studies have been inconsistent in their results regarding coffee and tea consumption and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-every-week-for-stronger-bones-11853649" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bone mineral density&lt;/a&gt; in postmenopausal women. That’s why researchers in Australia took a closer look at this topic, trying to clear up some of the confusion. They published their findings in &lt;i&gt;Nutrients&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew about 10 years of data from a 20-year study called the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), which included more than 9,700 women aged 65 and older. At clinical visits during years two, four, five and six of the study, the participants had their femoral neck and total hip bone mineral densities measured, which are common BMD measurement sites.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the same clinical visits, participants also completed self-administered questionnaires regarding coffee and tea consumption. Specifically, for coffee, they were asked, "Do you currently drink regular coffee? If yes, on average, how many cups of regular coffee do you usually consume per day?" For tea consumption, participants were asked "Do you currently drink tea or iced tea (excluding herbal or decaffeinated varieties)? If yes, on average, how many cups of tea do you usually consume per day?"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Demographics, which would be adjusted for during statistical analyses, were also collected, including age, BMI, cigarette smoking status, age at menopause, lifetime alcohol intake, lifetime physical activity and oral estrogen and steroid use. Medical histories were also taken, and weekly calcium and protein intake were calculated based on a 20-item dietary scale that participants completed at baseline.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers found no positive benefits of drinking coffee on bone mineral density. However, they did find potential negative effects on bone mineral density for those who drank more than five cups of coffee a day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Tea drinkers, however, may have an advantage over coffee drinkers, as researchers found an association between tea consumption and higher total hip bone mineral density in older postmenopausal women.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers note a few limitations to their study, starting with participants' self-reporting of coffee and tea consumption. Related to this, participants were not asked more detailed questions, like the size of their beverage cups and beverage strength. In addition, due to the length of follow-up (10 years) and the ages of the women, some died before the study’s end, and others were unable to finish due to health reasons. The dwindling participant pool may have weakened the study results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee and tea are some of the most widely consumed beverages globally. Because they’re &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7775696/plant-based-diet-for-beginners-your-guide-to-getting-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based&lt;/a&gt;, they contain antioxidants and the potential to lower inflammation and disease risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069479/is-coffee-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;coffee has been linked with&lt;/a&gt; a healthier heart and brain, among other benefits. It might also boost your mood and give you more energy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a regular tea sipper, you might even live longer and have a stronger immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The great thing about tea is that there’s a flavor for everyone. From green, black and white to jasmine, rooibos and mint, teas span the flavor spectrum—and they're all loaded with powerful plant compounds. If you want to go beyond traditional hot or iced tea, brew up some of our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8050463/how-to-make-thai-iced-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Thai Iced Tea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/266309/warm-honey-green-tea/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Warm Honey Green Tea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/berry-green-tea-smoothie-8746131" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Berry Green Tea Smoothie&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to bone health, other foods also have an influence. For example, you’re aware that dairy is good for your bones, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-protein-for-bone-health-11719674" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;canned salmon&lt;/a&gt; is also a great bone builder.

They look kind of dazed. They’re miserable. There’s a glassy look to their eyes,” he said.

While anyone of any age can be affected, H3N2 tends to cause more hospitalizations and deaths in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6c3fd" class="body-graf"&gt;There is concern that kids who are sick now with flu will spread it to grandparents and other older adults over the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03c5c" class="body-graf"&gt;“With schools going on break for a couple of weeks and family gatherings happening, it’s quite possible that some of the existing mixing of viruses amongst the school groups are going to change to a different population,” Budd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a77fdf" class="body-heading"&gt;Where is flu spreading? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-96f626"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1238" data-original-width="2500"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251219-cdc-influenza-map-bf-1330-1de503.jpg" alt="U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;U.S. map showing flu spread, ending Dec. 13.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;CDC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-512050" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu activity is high or very high in 14 states — including Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey and South Carolina — as well as New York City; Washington, D.C.; and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecda59" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu doesn’t need to be widespread, however, to be deadly. While the CDC’s latest report shows “minimal” flu activity in Wisconsin, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/news/releases/121825.htm" target="_blank"&gt;state health officials reported&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that a child in the state died of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c3493" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2025/12/17/ncdhhs-announces-first-pediatric-flu-death-2025-26-season-urges-vaccination-children-6-months-and" target="_blank"&gt;North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt; reported its first pediatric flu death of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bac42a" class="body-graf"&gt;Those cases are likely not counted among the CDC’s latest report, which shows three pediatric flu deaths so far this year, as the data is current through Dec. 13. The CDC’s next flu update will release on Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c71f8" class="body-graf"&gt;The 2024-2025 flu season was particularly deadly, especially for children. According to the latest data, 288 children died of flu — tying a record set during the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8b0029" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC report published in September&lt;/a&gt; found that half of the children who died of flu last year were otherwise healthy. About 89% hadn’t received the flu vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-6d434f" class="body-heading"&gt;Will the flu shot work this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e1aecc" class="body-graf"&gt;The annual flu shot is notoriously imperfect when it comes to matching the exact strains of flu that circulate. This year, a strain called H3N2 subclade K emerged, making changes on the surface protein of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-896c6d" class="body-graf"&gt;The surface protein is important because that’s what the body looks for to recognize whether it’s seen the virus before. If the protein looks even slightly different, the body may not be able to fight it off as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-571039" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s hard to predict how well this vaccine will ultimately work. Even though the strain has “drifted” a bit, the vaccines do contain protection against H3N2 virus in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9904a1" class="body-graf"&gt;“We’ve had past seasons where there have been what we call drifted viruses, which is how we would categorize this subclade K,” she said. “In some of those instances, there have been impacts on vaccine effectiveness, but there have also been seasons with drifted strains where we’ve seen the vaccine continue to provide protection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b9de3e" class="body-graf"&gt;Budd said it’s important for everyone, including children, to get the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7605af" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is still the primary preventive measure against flu, severe illness, and we absolutely continue to recommend it this year, even in light of the drifted strain,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-527bf3" class="body-graf"&gt;Demand for Tamiflu, an antiviral used to help treat the flu, is slightly higher than it was this time last year, &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/research/flu-season-tracking-tamiflu-fills" target="_blank"&gt;according to GoodRx.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-31e609" class="body-graf"&gt;People generally only get prescription antivirals when they’re sick enough to go to the doctor, not just because they tested positive for the flu, said Tori Marsh, senior director of research for GoodRx. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e97017" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“What stands out this season is how early Tamiflu use is climbing,” she said. “When we see prescription antiviral use rise sooner than average, it often points to flu activity building earlier and potentially lasting longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:42:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxORnhRcmJjVjJpVVlaM0N1S1hYeUxCazA0OFlfNnhQUVUzeXZlMTZmYjFPMl9wc0ZhMjRkdFNmbWFCWl9KVW9JbENONUlnRE5GYXhhRTMyZ05Ib28wSjlndG9xZ2VxUElWSVItMjV2Z3VHYlNIdjU2UHhvOUZjZHp1WWNWbEE3em1aVHlqSlVoSC1vRFhmVXhGR0tDTkdObXJORGZGQnhadU5lRm5O0gFWQVVfeXFMT3FFR0pETzRtRWdmV3N4cjVOLTJpU2UtTGNJNmVxWEhaWFh1U29BbnpwME1FQWVQS3dIckFiUXJfWlZoTi1od2h3UkphbVpxMzVEekIxQ0E</guid></item><item><title>随着流感开始蔓延，湾区学区近三分之一的孩子生病--《旧金山纪事报》</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/marin-flu-outbreak-schools-21252876.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — The Trump administration has awarded a $1.6 million, no-bid contract to a Danish university to study hepatitis B vaccinations on newborns in Africa that is raising ethical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unusual contract was awarded to scientists who have been cited by anti-vaccine activists and whose work has been questioned by leading public health experts. Some experts have suggested the research plan is unethical, because it will withhold vaccines that work from newborns at significant risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract did not undergo a customary ethics review, The Associated Press has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded the grant to a research team at the University of Southern Denmark that has been lauded by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-12-18/pdf/2025-23245.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;federal notice posted this week.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team’s leaders is Christine Stabell Benn, a consultant for a Kennedy-appointed committee that recently voted to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752"&gt;stop recommending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; a dose of hepatitis B vaccine for all U.S. newborns.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The study is to begin early next year in Guinea-Bissau, an impoverished West African nation where hepatitis B infection &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746078/#:~:text=Results:%20A%20total%20of%202715,enqu%C3%AAtes%20dans%20la%20population%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is common&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The researchers are funded for five years to study 14,000 newborns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s to be a randomized controlled trial, with some infants given the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and some not. Children will be tracked for death, illness and long-term developmental outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Most of the children will be followed for less than two years to look for side effects, but the first 500 enrolled will be followed for five years to look for behavior and brain development problems. There is no placebo involved, according to a copy of the study protocol prepared earlier this year that was obtained by the AP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can be passed from an infected mother to a baby. It also can be spread by other infected people a baby comes in contact with.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Research and widespread medical consensus holds that the hepatitis B vaccine protects newborns, so withholding it from some babies — in this case, Black babies — has raised ethical alarms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical evidence is clear that the vaccine protects infants from developing liver disease and an early death. The well-documented infection risk far outweighs hypothetical concerns about side effects, said Dr. Boghuma K. Titanji, an Emory University infectious diseases doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called the study “unconscionable,” and said it likely will exacerbate existing vaccine hesitancy in Africa and elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s so much potential for this to be a harmful study,” said Titanji, who is from Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benn did not respond to an email seeking comment about the proposal. An automatic response said she is out of the office until early January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the research team said the study “will be the first and likely the only one of its kind.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said it takes advantage of an unusual window of opportunity: Guinea-Bissau doesn’t currently recommended a birth dose of the hep B vaccine, but the nation will be implementing universal vaccination of newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine skeptics and opponents have suggested that all the vaccine’s possible side effects were inadequately studied before the CDC began recommending it for newborns in 1991. Public health experts counter that over more than three decades no serious side effect has been documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The award is highly unusual. The CDC did not announce a research funding opportunity and invite proposals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal was unsolicited and the award did not go through customary review, said a CDC official with knowledge of the decision. Department of Health and Human Services officials told CDC officials to approve it and said HHS would provide special funding for it, the CDC official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In private communications channels, CDC staffers were expressing outrage about the award, said the official, who is not authorized to talk about it and spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of those CDC scientists have compared the work to the infamous &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/30ba57133d6b47618eff042285b54d0e"&gt;Tuskegee Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which the agency oversaw in its later stages. In that decades-long study, health workers withheld treatment from unsuspecting Black men infected with syphilis so doctors could track the horrible ravages of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Like Tuskegee, this study involves the prospect of researchers watching people grow ill when a medical intervention could have kept them healthy, Titanji echoed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is an apt comparison,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study’s researchers say the trial was approved by a national ethics committee in Guinea-Bissau. But it did not undergo a customary ethics review within the CDC, the agency official told the AP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said “we will ensure the highest scientific and ethical standards are met.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health scientists noted questions have been raised in the past about research led by Benn and her husband, Peter Aaby, in their &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bandim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Earlier this year, former CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden wrote &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/02/rfk-jr-vaccines-former-cdc-director-tom-frieden-says-kennedy-mangled-science-in-gavi-decision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an editorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; calling a 2017 study co-authored by Aaby and Benn “fundamentally flawed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several researchers had harsh words about the latest award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aaby and Benn are doing the Guinea-Bissau HBV vaccine depravation trial,” Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington evolutionary biologist, wrote in &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlbergstrom.com/post/3mac5tfh4722v" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on Bluesky. “Did RFK Jr. just call up the first name in the antivax yellow pages?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://bsky.app/profile/angierasmussen.bsky.social/post/3mablyin5is2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; was giving taxpayers’ money to his “cronies” for a “grossly unethical study that will expose African babies to hep B for no reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Researchers found that GABAergic neurons in the BNST activate glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe, causing immediate arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the DpMe neurons were removed, the arousal response weakened dramatically, proving they are essential for this stress-to-wake circuitry. These findings reveal how fear and anxiety can instantly disrupt sleep and point to new therapeutic targets for stress-related insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; BNST GABAergic neurons trigger fast arousal via DpMe glutamatergic neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing DpMe glutamatergic cells sharply reduced stress-induced wakefulness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting this circuit may help treat stress-related insomnia and mood disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Tsukuba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional states and stress strongly influence sleep-wake regulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amygdala and its related structures have long been implicated in regulating arousal. However, the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers examined how GABAergic neurons in the BNST interact with glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe to induce rapid arousal from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic stimulation of BNST GABAergic neurons during NREM sleep resulted in immediate arousal, accompanied by a robust increase in DpMe neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, selective ablation of glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe significantly reduced this response, demonstrating their essential role in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was the first to thoroughly describe a BNST-DpMe neural pathway mediating emotional signals to arousal centers. In addition, the findings offer novel insights into how mental stressors such as fear and anxiety can disrupt sleep and highlights potential therapeutic targets for stress-related insomnia and mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was supported by the World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI), a JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (JP 18H02595) (TS), Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Research (Exploratory) 21K19287(TS), JSPS KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (JP 21H05036) (TS), JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP 23H04941 (TS), AMED Moonshot Research and Development Program, Grant Number JP21zf0127005 (TS), JSPS Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research 22K213511(TS) and JST, CREST Grant Number JPMJCR24T4, JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A) 23H04941(TS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178162286"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;How does emotional stress wake the brain so quickly?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: By activating a BNST-to-DpMe circuit that instantly shifts NREM sleep into wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178163874"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;Which neurons are required for this arousal response?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Glutamatergic neurons in the DpMe are essential for transmitting the wake-up signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1766178163665"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: &lt;em&gt;Why does this matter for insomnia?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: It identifies a concrete neural pathway that may be overactive in stress-related sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Editorial Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list has-background"&gt;&lt;li&gt;This article was edited by a Neuroscience News editor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journal paper reviewed in full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additional context added by our staff.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this stress and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c575354534f5548497c495212484f4957495e5d125d5f12564c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;

Similarly, an aversive air-puff activated GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, suggesting engagement by emotionally salient stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ablation of GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons markedly attenuated arousal responses triggered by GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; stimulation, underscoring their essential role in this circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While monosynaptic rabies tracing revealed local input neurons to GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; cells, in situ hybridization identified few &lt;em&gt;Vgat-&lt;/em&gt;positive interneurons among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that GABA&lt;sup&gt;BNST&lt;/sup&gt; neurons may influence GLUT&lt;sup&gt;DpMe&lt;/sup&gt; neurons through noncanonical GABAergic mechanisms or via more complex local circuits beyond a simple disinhibition model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings delineate a previously uncharacterized BNST–DpMe circuit that allows emotionally relevant stimuli to override sleep and promote arousal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pathway may contribute to stress-related sleep disturbances and represents a potential target for therapeutic treatments for sleep disorders associated with emotional dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:15:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9FTzZXdm94cW9FRjRnMERibndvajdHQWszQm91SmdQVGowSExsaUxJbHhXN3h2U3JiQlZrTEZzOXJhbG55ZHJNYTUwaUxlc3pnNm12YVptcm5qMmtkdmUzdmdaNHBmT0w3VGc</guid></item><item><title>R.F.K.

	Richard Eby knew things were getting bad when the schools shut down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Eby is a family medicine doctor based in Andrews, in West Texas. It’s a quiet town of 14,000, chock full of all-American touches — a Buffalo Wild Wings sits a few doors down from La Hacienda, a bottomless Mexican buffet with neon cacti on its facade and brightly colored &lt;em&gt;papel picado&lt;/em&gt; strung across its interior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Like many other towns nestled in Texas’ Permian Basin — of &lt;em&gt;Friday Night Lights &lt;/em&gt;fame — it is also unapologetically high-school-football-crazy: Andrews High School’s astroturfed Mustang Bowl, capacity 8,000, sits at the northwestern border of Mustang Drive, which forms a necklace around town. (The Mustangs, who have a long legacy of district championships tracing back to 1953, went 5-7 last year — though they refused to go down without notching three blowout wins against district rivals.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Come last January, there were new whispers around town. Eby had heard from colleagues that &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; was circulating in Gaines County, 30 miles north. And by the end of the month, he’d seen a few cases himself.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That was, in some respects, to be expected. After a 2019 outbreak in West Texas, a couple more confirmed cases in the South in 2023, and given that neighboring counties’ school districts have some of the highest vaccine exemption rates in the state —13 times the national average — Eby has gotten used to keeping the potentially life-threatening virus on his radar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It’s always at the back of your mind,” he says.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But it wasn’t until some local schools started shutting down in the ensuing weeks that Eby realized how bad this outbreak could get. Something felt off to the pediatrician — he says that, at the time, he recalls the official case count being a dozen. “That just tells you how far undercounted the cases were,” Eby says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the months that followed, more than 750 measles cases were diagnosed — 414 in Gaines County alone. Ninety-nine patients were hospitalized for severe symptoms such as inability to breathe and inflammation in the brain. Two otherwise healthy, stone-cold-normal children died.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To pediatricians like Eby, the outbreaks meant every typically innocuous symptom in clinic — every cough or sniffle, every hive or wheal or welt — put him and his staff on high alert. That’s because measles can start as just a stuffy nose and a red dot on the abdomen, but the illness rapidly evolves into whole-body bumps and blisters accompanied by difficulty breathing. In severe cases, it produces a child so sleepy they can’t be woken up, or seizures that won’t stop, because of swelling in the brain. And it can all happen within days of the itch starting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	So, Eby hasn’t been taking chances. “All of a sudden, a same-day appointment that’s on the schedule as a cough and rash,” he says, “you need to ask, ‘Did anyone clarify?’”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That style of medicine — the kind where a previously largely-forgotten foe was now lurking in the community, in the waiting room, and in doctors’ minds — also felt a bit like a step back in time, Eby says. At various points during the outbreak, he found himself thinking, “Is every kid going to have measles for the next couple weeks?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	That style of medicine is also becoming the norm, and not just in Texas. Even as attention has turned elsewhere — shutdowns, boat strikes, Epstein — the measles outbreak continues to rage throughout the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As of Dec. 2, almost 2,000 cases have been confirmed across 43 states. (The Centers for Disease Control is not publicly sharing the number of so-called probable cases — ones that were not tested. During previous international outbreaks, between 10 percent and 70 percent of cases were not tested.) That number is the highest in the United States since 1992. And after a summer lull, cases are climbing again: The week before Thanksgiving, the number of cases was the highest since May.



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Should the spikes continue into January, the U.S. will lose its “measles-free” designation from the World Health Organization — a label achieved in 2000. That’s part of a larger trend: In November, the WHO stripped the Americas of its measles-free label amid historic outbreaks in both Canada and Mexico. (Mexican officials say their outbreak was seeded from Texas; Canadian officials say theirs started with an “internationally imported” case, but did not specify whether it was American.)

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“This loss represents a setback,” Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, the region’s WHO oversight body, said of removing the measles-free label. “We call on all countries to redouble their efforts to strengthen &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/vaccination/" id="auto-tag_vaccination" data-tag="vaccination"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt; rates, surveillance, and timely response to suspected cases. Cooperation, solidarity, and science are stronger than any virus.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To some domestic public health officials, the issue isn’t just that the outbreaks are a step backward. It’s that they’re entirely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Life has enough curveballs and trauma that to have a tragedy like someone passing away from a completely preventable disease — that’s just hard to believe,” James McDonald, pediatrician and commissioner of the New York Department of Health, says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It’s not just measles. Cases of whooping cough increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, above pre-pandemic highs. Hospitalizations from flu this past year were at the highest rates in more than a decade. In 2024, almost 4,000 infants were born with syphilis infections — a figure eight times higher than the 2015 number. “We’re still dealing with things that First World nations shouldn’t even be talking about,” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	But under the current Trump administration, health officials say, it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under them — from under public health, as an institution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There have been the obvious, explicitly damaging measures. Take, for instance, the administration’s all-out assault on vaccines, which most recently, in early December, led the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to nix the decades-long recommendation to immunize all newborns against hepatitis B. The same day, a presidential memo directed Department of Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/robert-f-kennedy-jr/" id="auto-tag_robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-tag="robert-f-kennedy-jr"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; to “review best practices” related to vaccines and update the childhood immunization schedule accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	There have also been less obvious measures. Billions of dollars in cuts to the CDC, buried in the fine print of federal budgets. Billions more public health dollars to states clawed back, hidden in cases winding their way through the federal courts. Mass layoffs to the epidemiologists, and lab workers  and data collectors responsible for responding to, diagnosing, and tracking disease outbreaks in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Taken together, experts worry that the steps to hamstring the CDC (and other state departments) have imperiled the public’s health for political purposes. These actions are “seeding doubt …[and] hijacking resources away from families…[with] significant consequences,” says Susan Kressly, pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In the meantime, the measles outbreak is “continuing to grow,” she adds, “with no end in sight.”&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2 id="code-lavender" class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-primary-l   "&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Code Lavender&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Somewhere in Lubbock, Texas, stashed away in the corner of a hospital closet, there’s a cart stocked to the teeth with lavender-scented products. There are rollerballs and brushes. There are sachets and steamers. There are lavender-colored journals and pens, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The cart — and the team of counselors, chaplains, peer coaches, and therapy dogs that accompany it — was borne out of necessity during the Covid pandemic, says Shannon Bates, chief nursing officer at Covenant Children’s Hospital. The goal, she says, was to use aromatherapy, reflection, dialogue, and community to combat the “secondary trauma response” associated with death after death from that virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	For a while after the height of the pandemic, the cart got less mileage. But during the measles outbreak, the Covenant team has been pulling it out again. That’s partially because, in some ways, the script has flipped on clinical staff. With the unavoidable, politically charged conversations around vaccines that accompany the outbreak, “it’s kind of the opposite of Covid, where everyone was the health-care hero,” Bates says. “Now, you’re seen as the bad guy, the one who can’t be trusted.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	It’s also because, in addition to staff enduring rhetoric around health workers that’s ranged from distrust to resentment, they’ve witnessed firsthand just how harmful the measles outbreak can be. In February, a six-year-old girl died after being admitted to Covenant — the nation’s first death from the outbreak. That “definitely has taken a toll on staff,” Bates says. Since then, she adds, “we have done some proactive rounding.” In other words, rather than waiting for someone to ask for a rollerball or a sachet, they’ve taken to roaming the halls with the cart, the chaplains, and the puppies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Summer Davies also recalls the start of the outbreak, when the first call came in. It was the early afternoon, just after the team finished rounding. Davies, a pediatrician and associate professor at Texas Tech University, was patched through to a doctor who told her the child had a fever, and a rash, and needed to be admitted precautionarily. “I remember thinking at the time, ‘I don’t know, maybe it’s not measles,’” Davies says. That changed within moments of seeing just how sick the child was.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Davies was there when the six-year-old died, too — an experience she calls “devastating.” The death stuck with her: Long after it happened, she and her colleagues wondered, “Could we have done something different to help that child?”

	&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;

			
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Amid the circumstances, Davies says her hospital, as well as the county and state public health departments, was incredibly supportive. “We have had people…advocating for us, taking all of the right steps, making sure we’re safe and that patients are safe,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Off the wards, though, things were harder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	As the outbreak raged, federal agencies&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; ignored pleas for help&lt;/a&gt; from Texas officials. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, wrote in emails obtained by &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt; just days after&lt;/a&gt; children with measles started getting hospitalized. “We weren’t allowed to do anything,” a CDC official told &lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;. It took weeks until any agency officials dispatched to Texas — at which point HHS pressured them to highlight Vitamin A, rather than vaccines, as a solution to the outbreak. (In multiple interviews since January, Secretary Kennedy has claimed that Vitamin A can reduce measles deaths. Studies have consistently found that the salve demonstrates no effect in the greater than 99 percent of Americans who have adequate levels of the vitamin.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“As a health-care professional, that’s scary to hear,” Davies says of being all but abandoned by the federal government. “[But] it makes a big difference to feel supported by your hospital system,” she adds, “to know that they’re in our corner, if nobody else is.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Then there are the anti-vax politics — including &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;baseless allegations&lt;/a&gt; made by Robert Malone, a pathologist turned biotechnology executive, on his personal Substack. Malone’s influencer era kicked off in part thanks to a 2021 Joe Rogan interview in which he claimed, without evidence, that antacids cured his case of Covid and that the vaccine could cause narcolepsy. When it came to measles, he claimed that the two deaths from measles were the hospitals’ fault, the result of “medical mismanagement” rather than anything to do with vaccination. Those allegations were never refuted by the administration. And two months after they were posted, Secretary Kennedy appointed Malone as vice chair of the CDC vaccine advisory committee. “It’s impossible not to read some of those comments,” Davies says. Since then, though, she’s tried to stop reading the news.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Despite it all, Davies and her colleagues have pressed on. “We’ve really had tunnel vision: Let’s take care of our patients and do our job, boots on the ground,” she says. And on Aug. 18, the Texas outbreak was declared over.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	While that means Covenant’s staff can breathe a little easier — for now — in hindsight, Davies says, “it makes it even harder to know [that] this could have been prevented.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Likewise, her experience has made her fear for colleagues across the country. “With the nature of the disease and the high mortality rate from it,” Davies says, “more kids will die.”&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2 id="purposeful-chaos" class="heading larva //   lrv-a-font-primary-l   "&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;‘Purposeful chaos’&lt;/strong&gt;	&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Across the country, Davies’ compatriots are steeling themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease specialist at University of Kansas Medical Center, every child with a cough is “very high stakes” right now. “It’s only a matter of time” until an outbreak happens in his state, too, Hawkinson says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	To Alexandra Cvijanovich, pediatrician at Presbyterian Medical Group in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in today’s environment, “well child checks aren’t always well child checks.” Cvijanovich isn’t leaving any stones unturned: “I always worry: When am I going to have a child in my waiting room who has measles?” she says. The level of vigilance is in part from a deadly measles case she saw during residency that she described as  “the worst death of my pediatric career.” The current outbreak, Cvijanovich says, “has brought back all those memories.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	And to Douglas Fleck, pediatrician and medical director of quality at University Hospital Rainbow Babies &amp;amp; Children’s in Ashtabula, Ohio, even figuring out where to put sick patients is “straight-up a challenge.” Fleck doesn’t want to put them in the waiting room because “we take an oath to do no harm,” he says. But he also doesn’t want to turn them away, since that could lead patients who already distrust the health-care system to become even more entrenched. As a result, “we’re dusting off the Covid playbook,” Fleck says — doing as much as they can by telehealth, triaging patients in the parking lot, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Try as they may, all three doctors know their clinics may need help should things get out of hand. But ever since the first days of Trump’s second term, whether counties and states will have the resources to do so remains an open question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	One of the earliest threats came on March 24, when HHS summarily terminated $11 billion  in funding to states under the premise that those dollars, initially granted during Covid, were “no longer necessary…now that the pandemic is over,” according to a notice issued by the agency. That “immediately triggered chaos for State and local health jurisdictions,” according to an April 1 lawsuit brought by nearly two dozen states against HHS and RFK Jr. In May, a district court judge ruled in favor of the states; by July, HHS had appealed that ruling. As of this writing , the case continues to snake its way through the courts.

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	According to Sameer Vohra, pediatrician and director of the Illinois Department of Health, HHS’ logic is nonsensical. All the public health measures required to combat Covid — promoting vaccination, purchasing essential equipment, expanding labs, conducting contact tracing, assisting localities during outbreaks — serve as “infrastructure to allow us to be prepared for future emergencies as well,” Vohra says. His state saw nearly $500 million disappear overnight, $125 million of which had already been allocated. “This will have a debilitating impact,” Vohra says , should the federal government win its appeal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In New York, commissioner McDonald is reckoning with similar whiplash. In the immediate aftermath of the clawback, they laid off the majority of contract employees needed to support the department’s efforts. Other states, like Utah and Maine, likewise were forced to fire dozens of employees — further intensifying public health workforce shortages that the federal Government Accountability Office, in January , described as so severe as to threaten the nation’s ability to “conduct key public health functions…[and]respond to emergencies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Nationally, public health is really being threatened,” McDonald says.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Simultaneously, at the federal level, HHS — the backstop for states in situations of crisis — is roiling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	In late March, HHS slashed over 10,000 jobs, closed half its regional offices, and shuttered entire divisions, like those responsible for ensuring workplace safety standards, monitoring levels of environmental toxins, and supporting children with birth defects. National databases upon which public health departments, researchers, and clinicians depend are also fading to black as the data collectors are fired. Some of the gold-standard labs responsible for performing testing on illnesses like measles were shuttered, smack in the middle of the measles outbreak. And the disease detectives responsible for on-the-ground response in places like Texas were gutted, too. Which is perhaps in part why Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, heard crickets in response to her pleas for help in February.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It is unheard of that, in an active outbreak, [CDC] just says, ‘No…we’re not going to send people,’” Demetre Daskalakis, physician and former director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says. “[But] I don’t know who’s left.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“[They] are paralyzing the organization,” Daskalakis adds in reference to the federal government’s actions. “It is purposeful chaos.”

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	For doctors like Fleck in Ashtabula, it’s hard not to notice all of this — or, what it means about how the administration sees public health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“It’s hard to feel we’re being supported,” Fleck says. “Actions speak louder than words…and I think there are a lot of actions that they’re taking that raise a red flag.”



&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Still, Fleck will keep seeing the kids with the fevers, the coughs, the rashes. He’ll keep juggling the safety of that child with the others in the waiting room. And, even as it seems the scales are increasingly tilted against him, he’ll keep doing what he does. Because, for kids’ sake, there’s no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	“Day by day,” Fleck says, “patient by patient.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;The research, published in the &lt;a class="hover:text-vertical-primary underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4 decoration-vertical-primary" href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214343"&gt;journal Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed dietary habits and health outcomes among tens of thousands of people and found that those who regularly consumed high-fat cheese were less likely to develop dementia than those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Researchers examined data from more than 27,000 participants and found that people who consumed high-fat cheese had a 13% lower risk of all-cause dementia.

Low-fat cheese, low-fat cream, and other low-fat dairy products showed no significant association with dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Researchers also observed that participants who consumed more high-fat cheese tended to have a lower prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and stroke, and were less likely to use lipid-lowering medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

She noted that the study focused on a Swedish population, where cheese is more often eaten on its own rather than as part of heavily processed meals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="text-neutral-grey w-full mb-4 text-body-6 md:text-body-5 font-body dark:text-neutral-white external:text-custom-content-text external:dark:text-custom-content-text"&gt;Experts emphasized that while the findings are notable, high-fat foods should still be consumed in moderation due to their potential impact on cholesterol and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;

In &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, 224 people are in quarantine amid an outbreak that has sickened 144 people. Most are unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children’s Health Defense, or CHD, which Kennedy led from&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/how-rfk-jr-built-anti-vaccine-juggernaut-amid-covid-4997be1bcf591fe8b7f1f90d16c9321e#:~:text=In%202015%2C%20Kennedy,as%20an%20afterthought." data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 2015&lt;/a&gt; to 2024, produces a daily stream of articles and videos stoking fear about vaccines and falsely suggesting that the risks associated with vaccine-preventable diseases are exaggerated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the height of the South Carolina outbreak this month, when more than 200 people were in quarantine, CHD published an article circulating anti-vaccine tropes and arguing that criticism of Kennedy over the spread of measles was unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The article says CHD’s chief scientific officer “questioned whether measles needs to be prevented in the first place”. It quoted the host of a CHD.TV show saying it was “absurd” to blame Kennedy for outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;CHD did not respond to a Guardian request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As measles spread through the US this year, Kennedy has made statements that undermined confidence in the measles vaccine and the public health response, experts said. In one interview with CBS, he said “people should get the measles vaccine”, but then raised concerns &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/o2U0csKvqMY?t=553" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about whether it was adequately safety-tested&lt;/a&gt;. In an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/HVk-14n-VRE?t=2020" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;appearance in Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, he said the vaccine waned in effectiveness and was “leaky”, and suggested the case counts in the US were not so bad, compared with larger numbers overseas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR,97%25%20effective%20against%20measles" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; two doses of the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, is 97% effective. Most people do not experience side-effects and those that do occur are usually mild, like a fever or soreness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“HHS and CDC continue to support strong measles containment through active monitoring and coordination with state and local health departments,” Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for Kennedy, said in an email, adding that the US was faring better than Mexico and Canada in its efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Secretary Kennedy has emphasized that vaccination remains the most effective protection against measles,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said the article published by CHD this month was just the latest example of how the group was working off a familiar anti-vaccine playbook to defend Kennedy, downplay the dangers of disease and exaggerate the risks of vaccines – making it seem that it was worse to get vaccinated than to get sick, when the opposite is true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;These kinds of posts served multiple purposes, said Dorit Reiss, a vaccine law expert at UC Law San Francisco, who has tracked CHD and Kennedy for years. They were trying to convince themselves and people on the ground that measles was not so bad, while also defending Kennedy and themselves, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nobody wants to believe that they’re hurting children,” Reiss said. “They will be blamed for this, and they will be rightly blamed for this, because most of the cases are in the unvaccinated and they have been promoting anti-vaccine misinformation for years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Public health experts said Kennedy’s leadership had hurt efforts to contain measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Even if he’s not responsible for the actual start of the outbreak, he is most certainly responsible for the spread of the outbreak,” said Amy Pisani, CEO of the advocacy group Vaccinate Your Family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s not the first time CHD has mobilized this year around an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a measles outbreak in Texas earlier this year, CHD encouraged people not to get vaccinated and traveled there to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/texas-measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-ben-edwards-2dd7c79d47c64ad2e6d4a4ac3c87ec1f" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;produce videos&lt;/a&gt; saying measles wasn’t so dangerous. “Measles is not a grave threat to America’s children,” Mary Holland, chief executive officer, said in one article. It also published videos, articles and social media posts suggesting that the people who died of measles died of something else. Kennedy later echoed CHD’s assertions, suggesting that one child’s death &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-f-kennedy-measles-vaccine-rhetoric-19552867102b19e6df3ff14ed5030263#:~:text=He%20said%20the,two%20weeks%20before.%E2%80%9D" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;may have been caused by some other reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“She got over the measles, according to her parents, and according to the medical reports, I saw a report on it today, the thing that killed her was not the measles, but it was a bacteriological infection,” he told CBS News. He told Fox News her death was caused by pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pneumonia is one of many possible &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31490?autologincheck=redirected&amp;amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawOw7CVleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFIbnYyYmtEZGp3bXgzTGNXc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHkxc2DG-fVqPatJsatp4v9fzapThbI32mxsh5PoW4PeLNsqAJVvKvVaSEs6d_aem_CRs2YmnIynERUz7ACplVbw#:~:text=Other%20measles%20symptoms%20may%20include%20small%20spots%20in%20the%20cheek%20area%20inside%20the%20mouth%2C%20diarrhea%20and%20ear%20infection.%20Measles%20can%20lead%20to%20pneumonia%2C%20swelling%20of%20the%20brain%2C%20deafness%2C%20intellectual%20disability%20and%20death." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;complications of measles&lt;/a&gt;, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Those false assertions become a distraction from the reality that vaccines can help keep children alive and protected from disease, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The group’s work is notable at a time when a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/cdc-social-media-silence-during-2025-measles-outbreak-left-void-filled-news-media-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; found what researchers called an emerging online “health communication void” around measles. They said the CDC had posted just 10 times about measles across three social media platforms between January and August, far less than the average of 45.8 posts during that time frame in the past four years. From 2021 to 2024, 82% of posts promoted routine or “catch-up” measles vaccination, but not a single post from 2025 emphasized routine vaccination, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;By contrast, they found CHD posted 101 times about measles on X alone during the same timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In South Carolina, 18 more people have been reported infected since 12 December. State health officials said this week that children from four schools remained in quarantine, and some would be quarantined until 2 January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQMXliTjl5X3dCejQ5UVNzTnhXXzVJa3FfSURhUTFzOTE5VVJZdlBTdWkzQ3pCOEVVRURsazdlcXhLSEhEb2JoNUcycU00d2xVTElyRTFINVE5SUR3QWV2WEdLMXdtYVZncnFoY21vS0hxNjI1cS1CcDhDdWRXQUlZSGJGYUtWcGppS0R2LW4wNEhnREpG</guid></item><item><title>大约90%的人报告器官移植后的性格变化–为什么？ - IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/around-90-percent-of-people-report-personality-changes-after-an-organ-transplant-why-81969</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One strange phenomenon that’s gaining doctors’ attention is the way in which &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/iflscience-we-have-questions-can-transplants-change-your-personality-80631" target="_blank"&gt;organ transplants can change your personality&lt;/a&gt;. A particularly &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/do-donor-organs-transfer-memory-heart-transplant-patients-report-strange-personality-changes-77153" target="_blank"&gt;unusual case study&lt;/a&gt; involved a woman who, having lived a mostly vegetarian life, found herself suddenly drawn to Kentucky Fried Chicken after receiving a donor heart from someone who loved nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taste changes have been reported among people receiving bone marrow transplants, too, such as the person who went from hating pickles to loving them, and another who switched from white wine to red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transplant changes aren’t limited to dietary preferences, either. People have reported a change in preferences for everything from food to music, art, and sexual orientation. So, why might that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a phenomenon &lt;a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/health-and-medicine/about-us/people/adam-taylor" target="_blank"&gt;Adam Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, Professor and Director of the Clinical Anatomy Learning Centre at Lancaster University, UK, has questions about, too. Writing for &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/can-an-organ-transplant-really-change-someones-personality-228923" target="_blank"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, he explains how the placebo effect could be a contributing factor as the overwhelming joy of getting a second shot at life leads to a fresh perspective. There is, however, reason to believe that some of these changes could run deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get a new part – say a heart transplant – your donor heart might produce 20 percent more of something like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), or it might be more susceptible to the ANP that's circulating in your body already, so your resting heart rate goes up because your physiology is adapting and changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that donor organs are capable of influencing what’s going in the body for many people,” Taylor told IFLScience. “People report these personality changes (sometimes not a complete personality change but little changes) and it's feasible that – because of a transplanted organ – you are going to have changes in your physiology, and those changes in physiology then influence other organs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personality changes have been reported among heart transplant patients, which is a particularly interesting organ to consider. There’s the capacity for a kind of placebo effect, as many cultures consider the heart to be more than just a big pump, forming a part of who we are from bravery to our capacity to love (“she had a heart of stone,” etc.). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heart is also a great candidate for altering our physiology, however. Its chambers release peptide hormones that work with our kidneys to regulate fluid in the body, but it can also influence our hypothalamus, acting on our "&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-actually-is-fear-find-out-more-in-issue-39-of-curious-out-now-80703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fight or flight&lt;/a&gt;" response and mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fn7qhAxPCKs??si=ibI62NXvAC3aAxRO&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fr-mk"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the brain requires exposure to various hormones and signalling molecules,” said Taylor. “If you get a new part – say a heart transplant – your donor heart might produce 20 percent more of something like atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), or it might be more susceptible to the ANP that's circulating in your body already, so your resting heart rate goes up because your physiology is adapting and changing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example Taylor gives is that of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antidepressants-all-you-need-to-know-from-serotonin-to-psychedelics-73941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;serotonin&lt;/a&gt; – often touted as the “happiness molecule”. Most people think it’s all about the brain, but in truth, the majority of serotonin is produced in the gut and it has a systemic effect across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="blockquote--content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early studies are reporting somewhere in the region of 90 percent of people who undergo organ transplantation notice a change in personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="reference"&gt;Professor Adam Taylor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be said that no organ is an island, and our constituent parts are as interconnected and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/social-frailty-is-a-strong-predictor-of-dementia-but-two-ingredients-can-put-the-brakes-on-cognitive-decline-81659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;interdependent&lt;/a&gt; as we are. It would almost be more surprising, then, if it were possible to replace an organ without noticing some kind of change in your body and in yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve a lot still to learn about how much of these self-reported changes are rooted in physiology, or if certain organs are more likely to result in personality changes than others. But with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/organ-transplants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;organ transplants&lt;/a&gt; on the rise, early research suggests we’re going to have a lot more data to work from going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's absolutely something that requires more investigation,” said Taylor. “The problem is that so many more people are now [experiencing this phenomenon] that we're only just beginning to get enough [data] to be able to look at it, but it's definitely a thing.

                &lt;p&gt;When you picture nuclear disasters, you probably envision Chernobyl and Fukushima, but the worst nuclear accident in American history actually occurred in the hills outside Los Angeles in the summer of 1959. An experiment caused a meltdown at the nuclear reactors at the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, spewing up to 300 times the radiation as the famed Three Mile Island incident. Six decades later, the environmental and political fallout of the Santa Susana disaster continues to plague the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL), formerly known as Rocketdyne, is a testament to the innovation that defined America's post-war period. Even after the 1959 disaster, the plant continued to operate until 2006. Despite these operations, clean up has been severely lacking. Environmental advocates have pointed to the field's pollution as a prime example of the government's inability to protect communities. The field's new corporate owners, however, have largely brushed off these worries as overblown, and are looking to transform the former nuclear site into a nature reserve. Activists argue, however, that the move actually does more to ease the company's cleanup burden due to lower decontamination requirements, thus preserving the site's toxic pollutants rather than removing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disaster is a key example of the pitfalls plaguing &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1945647/big-tech-nuclear-energy-ai-data-centers/" target="_blank"&gt;America's growing nuclear energy sector&lt;/a&gt;. Featuring clandestine military research, blatant cover-ups, and a cleanup process languishing in bureaucratic limbo, this story reads like a movie script. In fact, the disaster spurred an award winning documentary, "&lt;a href="https://www.inthedarkofthevalley.com/" target="_blank"&gt;In the Dark of the Valley&lt;/a&gt;." Sixty years after the meltdown, Santa Susana poses critical questions regarding government transparency, corporate accountability, and environmental protection laws, particularly as the &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1985493/next-gen-nuclear-reactors-coming-us-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;United States continues to explore the efficacy of next-generation nuclear power&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;The Santa Susana meltdown was an epic disaster&lt;/h2&gt;
                                
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;On Monday, July 13, 1959, workers in the infamous Area IV section of the SSFL noticed the reactor was experiencing extremely high temperatures. Fearing a runaway reaction, the scientists undertook extreme cooling measures, plunging the reactor's control rods into the core and venting radioactive gas to alleviate the chance of explosion. Once temperatures cooled, the team brought the reactor back to life, unaware that it was still undergoing a mini-meltdown. Lacking modern containment structures,  plant scientists diluted the fission products with outside air before filtering them through a ventilation system, ultimately releasing an estimated 130–13,000 curies of iodine-131 and 260–2,600 curies of cesium-137 into the atmosphere. For reference, Three Mile Island only released 17 curies of iodine-131, making Santa Susana potentially one of &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/this-is-the-most-contaminated-nuclear-location-in-america/" target="_blank"&gt;the country's most contaminated nuclear locations&lt;/a&gt;. Critically, the wide range of these estimates underscores the lack of clarity scientists still have regarding the accident's scale and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unbelievably, news of the disaster didn't reach the public until 20 years later, when UCLA student Michael Rose discovered the Atomic Energy Commission's records, and subsequent cover up, of the accident. Over the next 50 years, at least three additional incidents occurred across is 10 nuclear reactors. The lab also emitted contaminants through its hot lab, a disposal facility where the country's nuclear fuel and reactor components were disassembled. Similarly, advocates later discovered the lab's plutonium fuel fabrication facility illegally burned contaminated reactor components in open air pits, releasing contaminants into the ever-nearing local community. The lab's tens of thousands of rocket tests caused millions of gallons of toxic chemicals to percolate into the site's soil and water, which stormwater runoff, wind, and other environmental factors have carried into the surrounding community.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;div class="news-article"&gt;
                
                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;Addressing contamination at Santa Susana&lt;/h2&gt;
                                
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Scientists are split on the degree to which the site's toxins have negatively impacted local communities. For instance, a 1997 UCLA study found SSFL workers experienced severely elevated rates of radiation-related cancers and death, but was quickly contradicted eight years later by a Boeing-funded survey which found no significant linkage. Two years later, however, researchers at the University of Michigan discovered a 60% increase in certain cancers within two miles of the lab, while researchers at USC's Keck School of Medicine found no measurable evidence supporting the claim in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address potential contamination, California's EPA struck deals with NASA and the Department of Energy to cleanup the facility by 2017. Boeing, which now owns the site, declined to sign a similar agreement, and the state's deadline passed without decontamination efforts breaking ground. A year later, a nearly 100,000-acre wild fire which began at the lab site unearthed toxic waste in the field's soil, blanketing surrounding communities with radioactive smoke and spreading contamination over nine miles away.  Meanwhile, advocates have criticized the public authority tasked with holding the site's owners accountable for its cleanup, California's Department of Toxic Substance Controls, for enabling much of the site's toxic chemicals to remain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, CalEPA &lt;a href="https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/press_room/press_releases/2022/pr05092022-dtsc-calepa-swrcb-ssfl.html" target="_blank"&gt;imposed&lt;/a&gt; stricter cleanup requirements for Boeing. In December 2025, the LA Water Board took steps toward holding Boeing accountable for these standards, seeking to fine Boeing nearly $600,000 over the site's contaminated stormwater runoff. The action comes shortly after an LA Superior Court ruled against the Boeing in its lawsuit challenging stricter contamination requirements for the site. Whether such measures spur a mass cleanup as the field transitions to a nature reserve remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

Researchers note that the effect is driven by the mental demands of controlling movement, rather than physical exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human perception of time rarely aligns perfectly with clock time. Everyday experiences, such as waiting in line or enduring a monotonous task, can feel longer than they truly are. Research has shown that physical activity, including cycling, walking, and running, can influence these distortions of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the underlying mechanism has remained uncertain. Some scientists have argued that physiological changes, such as elevated heart rate or hormone release, are responsible. Others have proposed that cognitive factors, particularly the attentional resources required to manage complex movements, play a more significant role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Tommaso Bartolini from the Italian Institute of Technology, the research team sought to clarify whether distortions in time perception during running are primarily physiological or cognitive in origin. Running on a treadmill requires careful motor control, which may place additional demands on attention. By comparing running with other conditions that involve less physical effort but still require cognitive resources, the researchers aimed to isolate the source of the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 22 participants (10 females), with an average age of 26. Each participant was asked to memorize a two‑second visual stimulus (a blue square displayed on a screen) and then judge whether subsequent stimuli lasted the same amount of time. This task was performed under four conditions: standing still (baseline), running on a treadmill at 80 percent of maximum heart rate, walking backwards on the treadmill, or standing still while performing a concurrent visual memory task (dual task).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart rate was monitored throughout the running and backward walking sessions to measure physical exertion**, while it was recorded for one minute prior to the baseline and dual task sessions.** The researchers then analyzed the accuracy and precision of participants’ time judgments across conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a consistent pattern. In all three experimental conditions (running, walking backwards, and the dual task) participants overestimated the duration of stimuli compared to the baseline. For example, during running, a stimulus lasting approximately 1.8 seconds was perceived as equal to the two‑second reference, representing an overestimation of nearly nine percent. Walking backwards and the dual task produced similar distortions of about seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these distortions did not correlate with changes in heart rate. Although running elevated heart rate substantially more than walking backwards, the magnitude of the time distortion was nearly identical. This strongly suggests that the effect is not driven by physiological exertion but by the cognitive effort required to control movement or divide attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, participants’ precision—i.e., the consistency of their judgments—remained stable across conditions. This indicates that while their perception of duration was biased, their ability to reproduce that bias reliably was unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartolini and colleagues concluded, “the results of the current study suggest that we should be very cautious in interpreting perceptual timing biases observed during physical activities as reflecting physiological alterations. The results also encourage the scientific community investigating time perception in ecological sensorimotor contexts to consider the potential confounding role of cognitive factors implicated in the execution of complex motor routines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some limitations are to be noted. For instance, the study focused exclusively on running and visual stimuli, leaving open questions about whether similar effects occur with other activities or sensory modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-07814-9" target="_blank"&gt;The role of physical and cognitive effort on time perception&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tommaso Bartolini, Irene Petrizzo, Roberto Arrighi, and Giovanni Anobile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 17:16:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOVkdfZC1qRXY3UlBhRmplY1ZnakV3Mm5qM19SNlNaWkFNUTNMZzBEa3dlWXlLRWRVamdfYmRHWVEyOTdWSm41ajNIaHlScWdHbWQxdWlCQWx1ZzBHNjczV2pySTc1WXAwU0twV2FOR2VvQTJxM0Q4cVg3WGtPMV9uTW54MjVwUQ</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府实际上可能会对慢性病做一些好事--除非是小RFK。挡道-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/12/chronic-lyme-disease-rfk-jr-could-help-patients-or-could-be-a-disaster.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="55" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2bw2e007y2gkp0bvj1gfv@published"&gt;When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. convened a panel on Monday to discuss “chronic Lyme,” many leading researchers of the disease were genuinely excited. Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services promised to allocate more resources to understanding the disease. There was hope, among experts, that this would mean an important new chapter for Lyme research.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001u3b7blifp16jj@published"&gt;But there’s a problem: Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist with seemingly little understanding of how modern science works. It didn’t emerge in Monday’s roundtable, but Kennedy, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings/card/rfk-jr-i-did-probably-say-that-lyme-disease-was-a-bioweapon-uQVxXUN67wwWnw2nw93Y"&gt;once claimed&lt;/a&gt; Lyme disease was &lt;a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2024/may/16/tucker-carlson/was-lyme-disease-spread-as-a-bioweapon-no-that-the/"&gt;developed by the U.S. military as a bioweapon&lt;/a&gt; in the ’70s. He still maintains that the medical community has “gaslit” the public over Lyme and even asserted, without evidence, that during the Biden years, there were top officials within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services who, due to political motivations, were “saying Lyme disease did not exist.”&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001v3b7b4ig8marn@published"&gt;This is not an ideal mindset to bring to any medical topic, but it’s particularly troubling for Lyme, given that it is already one of the most controversial diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

    


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8td001w3b7bmbl9hznn@published"&gt;Active Lyme disease, identified in the 1970s, is not a particularly mysterious illness. The tick bite that transfers the bacteria typically causes an easily identifiable bullseye rash; once spotted, symptoms, which can include fever, headaches, stiffness, and fatigue, can be resolved with a round of antibiotics. The treatment of active Lyme is fairly straightforward. But the &lt;em&gt;aftermath&lt;/em&gt; of active Lyme remains a deeply unsettled area of science. A subset of Lyme patients go on to complain of arthritis-like joint pain, fatigue, and neurological issues for years afterward. For a smaller population, the symptoms become debilitating. Some patients grow desperate and even suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001x3b7bhl1gth1y@published"&gt;Until recently, many mainstream medical professionals disputed the idea of “chronic Lyme” altogether, insisting that Lyme was done once it was treated with antibiotics. Any complaints the patients had afterward, they argued, likely resulted from other conditions or from psychiatric disorders, which can indeed cause severe physical symptoms. But patients don’t like being told something is all in their head, particularly when their lives are falling apart over a maddeningly persistent illness. As a result, a “Lyme community” began to form of patients who felt forced to become their own champions and validate one another’s suffering. Many looked for answers outside conventional medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001y3b7byhiehniw@published"&gt;The rush of pseudoscientists, grifters, wellness influencers, and celebrity advocates into the space only made the chronic Lyme debate more fraught. Even the term “chronic Lyme” was, and is, highly charged: In medical literature, doctors call it Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, in part to clarify that they are not referring to a continuous, chronic infection with the bacteria but only to a constellation of symptoms that develop and linger after confirmed bouts of Lyme disease. The people this term doesn’t include are those—often self-diagnosed laypeople or the patients of anti-scientific practitioners—who believe that they have insidious Lyme infections missed by blood tests and persistent beyond any normal antibiotic treatment. (The research does not show any evidence for a chronic Lyme &lt;em&gt;infection&lt;/em&gt;, experts said.) These patients never developed the rash or had any other concrete evidence of Lyme infection. These are the cases that caused many in the mainstream medical community to dismiss “chronic Lyme” as nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8te001z3b7bhqyxm23z@published"&gt;But mainstream scientists weren’t entirely ignoring the possibility of both undetectable and chronic Lyme, as much as Kennedy may insist otherwise. Many researchers agreed there was a need for better testing and that it was possible that real Lyme sufferers were going undiagnosed. And even in the earliest Lyme studies, experts said, the National Institutes of Health had attempted to suss out longer-term damage. The problem, said Dr. Brian Fallon, the director of the Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Research Center at Columbia University, was that most Lyme research dealt primarily with “well-defined” patients—those with telltale rashes and active infection that showed on blood tests—in order to have clean, careful studies. Those patients were those with the easiest cases, with easy diagnostics and prompt treatment. The potentially messier cases, without rashes, or with long periods of infection without treatment, were not taken into account. The pace of the research moved relatively slowly, given that Lyme was never such an urgent problem. It is not deadly or contagious like Ebola or AIDS. For many patients, it’s more like a temporary inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00203b7bzow664o1@published"&gt;But two things changed. First, climate change has made Lyme an increasingly visible and pressing issue. As the tick population explodes across North America, Lyme has become a virtually inescapable threat in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. Second, a global pandemic struck. In its aftermath, research institutions turned their resources to questions about COVID’s long-term effects. As they did, they began to bring those same questions to other infectious diseases that might result in chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00213b7bj8gtgrfi@published"&gt;“It shouldn’t come as any surprise to the world right now that infections can cause chronic problems, because of what we have learned from long COVID,” Fallon said. “I think it’s helped tremendously in changing the conversation. … There’s a great deal of interest in looking at something that’s been ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00223b7b5wwtcrh4@published"&gt;It is now a potent moment for Lyme research. If scientists can get the funding and resources they need to develop better diagnostics and unlock the mechanism that explains what is making chronic Lyme patients sick, it could bring profound relief to hundreds of thousands of Americans, allowing them to get the care they need. But a large part of pursuing a major medical breakthrough is separating science from pseudoscience in order to allow the scientific process to proceed with its dispassionate methods. And Kennedy has shown that he is incapable of that—and is steering his HHS &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/03/rfk-new-vaccine-policy-changes-maha"&gt;accordingly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00233b7bawmxfkhe@published"&gt;There are urgent reasons, beyond the success of future research, for the leading medical institutions in the country to try to purge the lingering anti-scientific elements in the Lyme conversation: They may actually put patients’ health at risk. When confusion meets desperation, as it does when the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health cannot provide any clarity, patients and doctors may seek out unconventional answers.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tf00243b7bgie6us9u@published"&gt;“A lot of these patients undergo bizarre, unapproved therapies, like extended intravenous antibiotic therapies, for months or even years,” &lt;a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/durland-fish/"&gt;Dr. Durland Fish&lt;/a&gt;, the chief executive officer of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, told Slate. “A lot of them are bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00253b7bgblr45w5@published"&gt;These treatments, Fish said, can be expensive, as they usually aren’t covered by insurance. And they can be deeply dispiriting when they don’t work. Some patients, he said, can become depressed and even suicidal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00263b7bs86fldy0@published"&gt;And perhaps even more worryingly, if a patient becomes convinced they have chronic Lyme based on an influencer’s videos, they may be diverted from identifying something else. Part of the reason chronic Lyme has always been controversial is that its symptoms are so nonspecific. Fatigue, brain fog, headaches, and joint pain can be caused by anemia, sleep disorders, mental illnesses, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, ALS, fibromyalgia, cancer, and many other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00273b7bk8m8hdat@published"&gt;“From my perspective, I think the misdiagnosis and mistreatment is a bigger problem than the actual Lyme disease,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tg00283b7b86mkgwoj@published"&gt;Now, as chronic Lyme emerges from its era of hazy theories and pseudoscience, it continues to be tainted with its previous associations. As an example, New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who attended Monday’s hearing, &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/defense-bill-directs-gao-to-probe-tick-conspiracy-promoted-by-rfk-jr/"&gt;slipped a provision&lt;/a&gt; in the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed Wednesday, requiring the Government Accountability Office to investigate whether Lyme disease was bioengineered by the U.S. military. (Lyme disease, it should be noted, predates the United States itself by millennia.) During Monday’s hearing, he complained that mainstream news media, including &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/07/17/gop-lawmaker-thinks-rise-lyme-disease-is-due-secret-tick-experiment-scientist-squashes-that-idea/"&gt;the Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;, had portrayed him and his allies “like we have a tinfoil hat on our heads.” Smith is a Republican, but conspiratorial thinking on Lyme is a bipartisan problem.&lt;/p&gt;

As head of HHS, Kennedy has baselessly attributed &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/12/09/vaccine-covid-coronavirus-safety-fda/"&gt;deaths to the COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, connected both Tylenol and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/10/circumcision-tylenol-autism-rfk/"&gt;circumcision to autism&lt;/a&gt;, and linked &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/29/ssris-mass-shootings-science-rfk/"&gt;SSRIs to mass shootings&lt;/a&gt;. In one throwaway comment in the hearing, he claimed that the antiretroviral drug developed during the AIDS epidemic under Anthony Fauci’s NIH killed more people than AIDS itself.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002a3b7ba0ciyk17@published"&gt;The panel he convened was similarly questionable. Participants were largely not the leading experts in Lyme research but instead patients, medical technology business owners, politicians, and people with out-there theories about the disease. One person claimed there was a connection between Lyme disease and autism—something no mainstream researcher seems to find credible. Another person, who is a patient and an HHS official, asserted that had she followed standard medical Lyme treatments, “I would be dead today.” Lyme disease is not a fatal disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002b3b7b30zuvel9@published"&gt;Still, Fish, like the other experts, said that Kennedy’s NIH putting more resources into understanding chronic Lyme could be extremely helpful for the thousands of Americans struggling with mysterious symptoms. These patients, he said, need answers and better diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="18" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002c3b7bzej9xqvp@published"&gt;“These patients have serious illnesses, and I don’t blame them for raising hell about the situation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002d3b7bjg1tv8ct@published"&gt;Lyme is a disease that makes sense as a target for Kennedy, as obsessing over chronic illnesses is a core tenet of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Kennedy has said one of his sons developed Bell’s palsy from Lyme and that one son developed severe, debilitating chronic Lyme. Kennedy is also, fittingly for his family’s reputation for being full of robust outdoorsmen, a big proponent of getting outside into the woods—advice being made dangerous by the ticks. He noted the “spiritual” value of the outdoors in his address Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tk002e3b7boma1oia8@published"&gt;Lyme also makes some sense as a target for the moment, when there is no epidemiological crisis such as SARS or COVID or AIDS consuming all the oxygen in the conversation. Leading experts in Lyme say people are beginning to understand the “insidious epidemic” of Lyme, as Dr. John Aucott, the director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center, put it. He and Fallon expressed the need not just for studies and testing but an entire built-out academic infrastructure around it. Right now, most academic programs are struggling under federal budget cuts; Lyme research is one area where Kennedy’s personal interest may be of use.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002f3b7beqrac170@published"&gt;For countless Americans, this could be great news. Aucott noted that he watched AIDS go from a death sentence to a manageable condition—proof that painstaking, rigorous research can revolutionize the understanding and treatment of a new disease. Today, he said, some of his Lyme patients are sicker than the AIDS patients were at the end of his time treating them.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002g3b7b80rl10w0@published"&gt;Hopefully, Kennedy’s anti-science approach will not impede the evidence-based Lyme research that comes. His sloppiness, as when he repeatedly during panel discussions conflated Lyme disease and Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome, may not carry through to actual policy. And in at least one way, experts gave Kennedy credit on something else: He’s right, they said, that most people are not just sick from psychosomatic causes. “These are complex illnesses we’re just starting to understand,” Aucott said. “They’ve got a hard-to-explain illness. That doesn’t mean it’s just in their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmjd2p8tl002h3b7b89dqz06s@published"&gt;But when diseases are particularly complex, and when the medical understanding of a topic shifts rapidly, it’s particularly damaging to have a man who consistently undermines the mainstream scientific community as the face of its public health response. The public needs clarity from its government, not just disruption. In this case, clarity doesn’t just mean validating suffering patients’ frustrations. It means acknowledging the limits of our knowledge while having an open mind—and focusing not on heated feelings but on the scientific &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is part of sweeping changes to childhood immunizations by the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, which have global repercussions – including cutting funding for programs that bring vaccines to countries around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He has a fixed, immutable belief that vaccines cause harm,” said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “He will do everything he can to try and prove that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The actions taken this year by Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist, have “a global impact”, said Elizabeth Jacobs, professor emerita at the University of Arizona and a founding member of the grassroots group Defend Public Health. “It is spreading like an infection all its own throughout the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"CDC ends recommendation for all US newborns to receive hepatitis B vaccine","elementId":"ac53fa77-3147-4904-b1aa-a83868a3b251","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/16/hepatitis-b-vaccine-cdc"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Testing established vaccines in a country with high rates of hepatitis B and a fragile health system “reeks of a neocolonialist attitude” and risks expanding global mistrust of the US and science, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When Kennedy announced in June that the US would end funding to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which has vaccinated more than 1.2 billion children and saved an estimated 20.6 million lives, he sent shock waves through global health – and he cited an unusual study from 2018 to justify the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2018.00079/full" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; made an alarming claim: the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine caused death in young girls in Guinea-Bissau. It was published by a group of Danish researchers, including a married couple named Peter Aaby and Christine Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But when Kennedy made his announcement in 2025, he did not mention a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X21007209" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from some of the same authors on the same topic finding completely different results, essentially nullifying the first study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We did not find that early-DTP was associated with increased female mortality as found in a previous study,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is one example of their questionable research, which has drawn criticism from other researchers and journalists examining their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Now those same researchers will be the ones carrying out the new study on hepatitis B vaccination in Guinea-Bissau. US funding will go to the &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Bandim Health Project&lt;/a&gt;, led by Aaby and Stabell Benn, at the University of Southern Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aaby and Stabell Benn did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries about the details of the five-year study, set to begin in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Babies in the randomized, controlled trial will or will not receive the hepatitis B vaccine at birth. Researchers will then compare early-life mortality, illness and development between the groups, according to the &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-23245.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;award announcement&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; giving the vaccine to all babies at birth, but Guinea-Bissau has struggled to roll out the shots to every newborn, instead &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tmi.14045#:~:text=Examples%20of%20risk%2Dfactors%20of,Bissau%20between%202005%20and%202007." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; the dose at six weeks of age. The country has pledged to fill that gap and plans on recommending hepatitis B vaccines to all newborns in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is a major breach of scientific ethics to withhold an intervention that has been proven safe and effective. “It’s highly unethical to choose to give a vaccine to some children but not others,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yamey noted: “There’s already an RCT [randomized, controlled trial] showing superior outcomes with the birth dose, so why is another one needed?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study does not appear to be looking at whether the vaccine is more effective at birth, which Jacobs said was “concerning” as “nowhere in this do they say that they’re going to study the efficacy of the vaccine itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the trial will examine whether there are “overall health effects” – not specific outcomes, such as preventing infection from the virus – when the shot is given at birth, &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/hepatitis-b-vaccine-at-birth/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Bandim Health Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This announcement has set alarm bells ringing in the global health community,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, calling it a symptom of “a policy desperately searching for evidence”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is not clear what the research question is. It seems to be about the safety of the vaccine rather than its effectiveness, but both are already well-established, and to undertake such a study in a population where almost one in five of the adult population has a marker of infection seems extremely risky,” McKee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He also questioned whether participants could truly give informed consent, given the ethical concerns about how the study is being conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent survey, about 18% of Bissau-Guinean adults had hepatitis B, a virus that can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, especially among young children. If a baby is infected in the first year of life, there is a 90% chance they will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer; between the ages of one and five, there is a 25% chance. Among adults, about 5% have a chronic infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39187275/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of toddlers in Guinea-Bissau, about 11.2% already had hepatitis B infection, which means not enough babies are getting the shots, said Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at the University of Oxford. Across sub-Saharan Africa, only about 17% of babies receive the recommended birth dose, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The priority should be to increase vaccination with the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and protect more babies from the risk posed by this virus,” Pollard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the US, recommending the vaccine at birth to all babies – not just those who appeared to be at risk of infection – caused rates among children to drop precipitously, from 20,000 to about 20 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We virtually eliminated hepatitis B in children less than 10,” Offit said. Children may be infected at birth, but they may also come into contact with other children and adults carrying the virus – which can remain infectious on surfaces for up to a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The experts voiced concerns about how the study would take place. It is unusual for a trial like this to take place in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt; instead of the United States or Denmark, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Why on Earth is this study happening in a high-endemic setting where the birth dose matters the most?” Yamey asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In Denmark, where only &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36221255/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;three in 1,000&lt;/a&gt; people have the virus, the shot is not currently recommended at birth either, which means the same study could be conducted there. Denmark also has health registries, making it easier to access complete medical records. Instead, by working in a country with precarious healthcare and high rates of the illness, studies like this may lead to “expanding distrust in global public health”, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The US canceled much of its global aid and research earlier this year, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In the face of the US canceling all this funding for vulnerable countries, and then it’s still going to pay for this research to be done – that is really worrying,” she said. “It seems to say we don’t value your lives enough to continue to provide support overall, but we won’t hesitate to experiment with your population.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study is single-blinded, which means the patients will not know who got the vaccine and who didn’t, but the research team will – which can affect the way they collect and interpret the data. “This means they can stamp their own biases on the results,” Yamey said. And the endpoints – “overall health effects” – are “very squishy”, which leaves the results vulnerable to manipulation, Jacobs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Henrik Støvring, a professor of statistics and pharmacometrics at Aarhus University who co-wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X25012344?via%3Dihub" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red flags&lt;/a&gt; in Bandim Health Project research for the journal Vaccine this month, said “broad hypotheses like these carry a high risk of false positive findings, and in general the research group has previously been reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods to curb such a risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I think conflicts of interests are always an issue when the donor so explicitly seeks out a research group and funds a study,” Støvring said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish journalist Gunver Lystbæk Vestergård has also &lt;a href="https://www.weekendavisen.dk/samfund/et-daarligt-immunforsvar" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about major issues with research conducted by Aaby and Stabell Benn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After the CDC sparked outrage by changing the recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination with no evidence, Jacobs said, “they’re now funding this to try to give themselves cover for having done that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Because &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Robert F Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt; is an anti-vaccine zealot, he will somehow contort that study to look like the hepatitis B birth dose causes harm” or that it is better to delay the shots, Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists, doctors and medical organizations are speaking out against Kennedy, he said, but “this is a political problem, and it requires a political solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, children will bear the brunt of these decisions, Offit continued: “This breaks my heart. It really does. It’s hard to sleep knowing that children are constantly being put in harm’s way by the administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPMklZRDZ3YzROa0xGdVdzQkJlLXA4U0hTV3F6S0pCSUZURTF0WFlvdUNpZ2ZUN3ZHQXNvaWlOZnRQV2dMYnlYaWFkSlQ0R1BIVEIwTDdLczRTRk1EX1ZsV05iMWpKSHduVjN4ZlF2WXZKLW1VeW0yRWg2SkU4TTgyRnJCdnhsaVA3THFNVkszSVpHRWpxRUE</guid></item><item><title>奶酪可能有助于避免痴呆症，建议对超过25年的2.7万人进行研究-好消息网络</title><link>https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheese-may-help-stave-off-dementia-suggests-study-of-27k-people-followed-over-25-years/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="td-post-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Sweden found a link between eating more high-fat cream and high-fat cheeses and a lower risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who consumed 20 grams or more of high-fat cream daily had a 16% lower risk of dementia than those who consumed none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who ate 50 grams or more of high-fat cheese—containing more than 20% fat—had a 13% lower risk of dementia than those eating less than 15 grams daily, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No association was found for low-fat dairy products, butter, milk or fermented milk, which includes yoghurt, kefir and buttermilk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that the study, published in the journal Neurology, does not prove that eating high-fat cheese and high-fat cream lowers the risk of dementia, it only shows an association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For decades, the debate over high-fat versus low-fat diets has shaped health advice, sometimes even categorizing cheese as an unhealthy food to limit,” said Professor Emily Sonestedt, of Lund University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study found that some high-fat dairy products may actually lower the risk of dementia, challenging some long-held assumptions about fat and brain health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers analysed data from 27,670 people in Sweden with an average age of 58 at the start of the study. They were followed for an average of 25 years. A total of 3,208 participants developed dementia during the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants kept track of what they ate for a week and answered questions about how often they ate certain foods during recent years. They also talked with researchers about how they prepared their food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical serving of cheese is one ounce. Of those who ate more high-fat cheese, 10% developed dementia by the end of the study. Of those who ate less, 13% developed dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for age, sex, education and overall diet quality, the research team found that people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 13% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those who ate less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific types of dementia, they found people who ate more high-fat cheese had a 29% lower risk of vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/article/full-fat-cheese-linked-lower-risk-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; also found&lt;/a&gt; a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease among those who ate more high-fat cheese, but only among those not carrying the APOE e4 gene variant, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also compared people who consumed 20 grams or more of high-fat cream daily to people who consumed none. After similar adjustments, researchers found that those who consumed high-fat cream daily had a 16% lower risk of dementia compared to those who consumed none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, observational studies that show links and associations are not considered useful unless the association reaches above 60%. In that sense, the value of the findings is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO CHEESE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="26 Years of Research Shows Cardiovascular Health in Dairy Lovers is Not Aversely Affected by Choosing Cheese" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cheese-actually-reduces-risk-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-provides-a-lot-of-health-benefits/" rel="bookmark"&gt;26 Years of Research Shows Cardiovascular Health in Dairy Lovers is Not Aversely Affected by Choosing Cheese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthy user bias is a feature of observational studies that can affect the outcome. It describes a phenomenon whereby people who are willing to make one choice regarding their health are more likely to make others, and that as their potential effects become difficult to separate out of the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, one would guess a study influenced by healthy user bias would find a negative association with cheese and cream, since those who eat no cheese or cream will usually be making that choice in conjunction with several others to try and improve health, such as exercise or a higher quantity of vegetables at meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO CHECK OUT: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Trendy Type of Norwegian Cheese May Stave Off Bone Thinning, Shows New Study" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/norwegian-cheese-may-stave-off-bone-thinning/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Trendy Type of Norwegian Cheese May Stave Off Bone Thinning, Shows New Study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who don’t focus on health in their lifestyle and diet choices won’t exclude cheese cream—an inference because they won’t make any other choices. The results, being counter-intuitive, make the study results compelling even if the association with dementia was small&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fermented foods like yogurt and kefir, generally eaten for health reasons, showing no association only adds to the curious direction the data took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team says further research is needed to explore whether consuming certain high-fat dairy offers some level of protection for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE CHEESE NEWS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="First Ever Cheese Museum Opens in Paris: ‘It’s Gouda Brie a Delicious Visit’" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/the-first-ever-cheese-museum-opens-in-paris-see-learn-and-taste-of-course/" rel="bookmark"&gt;First Ever Cheese Museum Opens in Paris: ‘It’s Gouda Brie a Delicious Visit’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings suggest that when it comes to brain health not all dairy is equal,” said Professor Sonestedt. “More research is needed to confirm our study results and further explore whether consuming certain high-fat dairy truly offers some level of protection for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonestedt noted that in Sweden, cheese is often eaten uncooked, while in the United States, cheese is often heated or eaten with meat. She says it is important that studies also be conducted in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medications can play a key role in managing high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Certain foods and beverages can increase or decrease how well your medications work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alcohol, grapefruit, and meals high in sodium and fat can affect a medication’s efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure affects nearly half of all U.S. adults, yet only about 1 in 4 has it under control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While lifestyle habits, like a balanced diet, regular movement and avoiding smoking, remain the foundation of treatment and prevention, most people still need medication to manage their numbers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, data show that many adults already on &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/american-heart-association-blood-pressure-guidelines-11807791" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antihypertensive medications&lt;/a&gt; often need a higher dose or an additional medication to reach their target blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because so many people rely on prescriptions to stay within a healthy range, it’s crucial to understand how certain foods, even nutritious ones, can influence how well those medications work. As &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikaigray/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Erika Gray, Pharm.D.&lt;/a&gt;, explains, “You may not realize it, but the very foods you put into your mouth might be changing how well your blood pressure medications work. Certain foods can either make your medications more or less effective. In order for your blood pressure medications to work optimally, it’s important to have a steady, predictable amount of the medication in your blood at all times.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With that in mind, we’ve highlighted the top foods and beverages to be mindful of when taking common blood pressure medications. Here’s what experts recommend discussing with your health care provider before regularly adding them to your meal routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-alcoholic-beverages"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Alcoholic Beverages &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may be over 21, but it’s best to put down that alcoholic beverage if you’re taking a beta-blocker medication to manage blood pressure. Remember, alcohol can have detrimental effects on total body health, but your blood pressure too. In fact, alcohol has been shown to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7919807/triumph-resistant-hypertension-study/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase heart rate and blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, counteracting in a way many blood pressure medications that are designed to do just the opposite.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://gingerhultinnutrition.com/about-seattle-wa-nutritionist-ginger-hultin/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ginger Hultin, D.C.N., RDN, CSO,&lt;/a&gt; shares, “Beta-blockers help to slow down heart rate and relax blood vessels, ultimately lowering blood pressure. These medications should be taken with food, but not with alcohol.” Gray also notes that increased dizziness can occur when &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/medicines-to-not-mix-with-alcohol-11777250" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;mixing alcohol with beta-blocker usage&lt;/a&gt;, causing a ripple effect if you’re already sensitive to alcohol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gray advises patients to limit or avoid alcohol entirely if they’re taking a beta-blocker.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-grapefruit--grapefruit-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Grapefruit &amp;amp; Grapefruit Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You may have heard that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-grapefruit-8783128" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;grapefruit and its juice&lt;/a&gt; are cautioned when taking blood thinners, but they also should be avoided if you’re taking a blood pressure medication known as a calcium channel blocker, too.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Calcium channel blockers are a class of blood pressure medications that help the heart’s muscle cells and arteries relax by preventing calcium from entering.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Through this mechanism, narrowed blood vessels open, allowing blood pressure to decrease. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Grapefruit and grapefruit juice can interact with the enzymes needed to break this medication down, notes Gray, leaving patients with “dangerously high levels of the drug in your blood.” When this happens, Gray shares, “patients may experience severe dizziness, low blood pressure and heart rhythm changes.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hultin recommends patients avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice entirely if taking this type of medication. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-high-potassium-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. High-Potassium Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A few types of blood pressure medications, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and potassium-sparing diuretics, can cause your body to retain potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Gray writes, “An &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8069581/what-does-potassium-do/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excess of potassium in the body&lt;/a&gt; is known as hyperkalemia, and can be extremely dangerous, affecting heart rhythm, if not managed properly.” While there are many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;foods that are high in potassium&lt;/a&gt; that also can help lower blood pressure, like bananas and avocados, if you’re taking a blood pressure medication that is sensitive to potassium, you need to reevaluate where your nutrition comes from.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, many items that are labeled as low-sodium actually contain salt substitutes, like potassium chloride, that can increase potassium levels further if you’re taking an ACE inhibitor, ARB or potassium-sparing diuretic. Hultin recommends reading the labels of foods that may contain salt substitutes, like frozen meals, canned soups and some shelf-stable entrees. Plus, she encourages working with a trained medical professional, like a dietitian, if you’re on one of these medications to help keep your potassium intake in a healthy balance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-high-fat-meals"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 4. High-Fat Meals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need to avoid all high-fat meals if you’re on a beta-blocker, but one type—immediate-release propranolol—should be avoided with high-fat meals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Remember, dietary fat digests more slowly in the digestive system, meaning your body may not process medications taken with a high-fat meal the same way it would without food. Gray shares, “Higher fat meals can increase the absorption of propranolol in unpredictable ways. To ensure consistent results, it is best to take this medication on an empty stomach (one hour before or two hours after eating).”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-sodium-rich-foods"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 5. Sodium-Rich Foods &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it’s good practice for patients with high blood pressure to be mindful of their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium intake&lt;/a&gt;, it’s especially important when taking certain blood pressure medications, such as ACE inhibitors. By nature, ACE inhibitors are designed to help the body produce less angiotensin, a chemical that causes narrowing of the arteries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This helps lower blood pressure by allowing the blood vessels to relax and open up.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Hultin shares, “Patients taking an ACE inhibitor medication may be advised to follow a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7981788/low-sodium-foods-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;low-salt diet&lt;/a&gt;, and should use caution with potassium salt substitutes or potassium-containing supplements,” as noted above.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re managing high blood pressure, chances are prescription medication plays a key role, meaning the foods you choose can influence how well those medications work. Partnering with your health care team, including a pharmacist and dietitian, can help you identify which foods and beverages deserve extra attention. Alcohol, grapefruit and its juice, high-sodium and high-potassium foods, and even high-fat meals can all affect medication effectiveness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hultin offers an important reminder: “Nutrition advice is not one-size-fits-all and should always be personalized to you. If you’re prescribed one of these medications, be sure to ask for a referral to a dietitian for individualized nutrition recommendations.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPYXdSaHJDV1F3aXBGVUlQQ3dJQXIwaG9zTnFpR0dTaFBsbzgwNzlLbmhHeEZjMDdRT0xLbG5oaklodnY1R0hCN0lwX2ljVlkwZ25LNXdkZ0JBakFzTHA1QUxTTWxBbXI3c0txX3BVNWZIR1hOZlJ6SWpuSk1SSjdPOGVfekFXbE1u</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，在饮食中摄入更好的血糖后要做的3件事- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/post-meal-habits-for-better-blood-sugar-11870902</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy everyday habits after a meal can help you manage your blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a short walk, drink water and add post-meal fiber to help lessen a rise in blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More healthy habits include smoking cessation, daily movement and better sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s not just what you eat that can influence your blood sugar—but what you do after a meal too. Certain small post-meal actions can reduce spikes, prevent crashes, improve energy and support overall metabolic health. These don’t replace medication, so if you have diabetes, talk to your doctor about treatment strategies needed to stabilize your blood sugar. Here are three practical things dietitians recommend doing after eating for better blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 1. Take a 10-Minute Walk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Light movement after eating is one of the best ways to blunt your body’s blood sugar response to a meal. “Walking after eating is effective because it helps your body use the glucose from your meal right away, instead of letting it build up in your bloodstream,” says diabetes educator &lt;a href="https://www.amysnutritionkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Kimberlain, M.S., RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, she points out, exercise also diverts blood flow away from the intestines, lessening glucose absorption. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research supports the idea of heading out for a short walk. One small study found that a 10-minute walk right after eating effectively lowered blood glucose levels in healthy young adults better than a control group who rested instead.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Plus, the effects of a 10-minute walk were similar to a 30-minute walk, so researchers recommend the shorter stroll for being more practical for daily life. And in research involving people with type 2 diabetes, physical activity done right after a meal is also effective in lowering blood sugar—and may be a sound strategy for improving long-term blood sugar management.&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Can’t get outside? That’s OK. Move around your home, whether that’s light housework, clearing the table or doing the dishes, recommends &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/grace-a-derocha" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Grace Derocha, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Personally, she saves her laundry for after a meal, which gives her a task that requires going up and down the stairs. That’s a great idea, too, as one study found that one to three minutes of stair climbing improved after-meal insulin and glucose levels.&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 2. Drink Water &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Drink up after a meal—but make it water. Ideally, you’ll also be drinking water throughout the meal, too. “Drinking water can help, but it won’t stop a spike on its own—it’s more of a gentle support strategy than a powerful intervention like walking,” says Kimberlain. Hydration helps by assisting your kidneys in removing excess glucose from the bloodstream, she explains. Staying hydrated helps to maintain normal blood volume, which is also impactful for blood sugar levels. “Drinking water dilutes the concentration and supports more stable numbers,” Kimberlain says.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; 3. Add a Healthy Fruit Dessert &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You finished your main meal—now what? “I recommend adding a ‘finishing fiber or fruit,’” recommends Derocha. “Certain foods that we eat can support a smoother glucose response, as well as digestion.” She recommends having a high-fiber fruit (such as berries) or fiber-rich dessert (such as chia seed pudding). Fiber helps slow down the absorption of carbohydrate foods from the meal.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And sometimes you just need a little something sweet to tell you that you’re done. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re not into sweet, finishing the dinner with a fermented food like kimchi is another idea, says Derocha. Fermented foods may help regulate glucose metabolism, and their probiotic properties aid in digestion and reduce inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;One of the simplest things you can do to reduce spikes is eat more fiber, says Kimberlain. Doing so helps prevent glucose from entering your bloodstream quickly. Ultimately, higher-fiber meals will keep after-meal glucose levels steadier, she says. Oatmeal with berries, beans in a salad, and quinoa, farro and sweet potatoes at dinner are all examples of fiber-rich options.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a balanced plate: &lt;/strong&gt;When planning your meals, complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats and fiber are an ideal combination for healthy blood sugar, says Kimberlain. Plus, this type of plate also helps keep you full.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat foods in order. &lt;/strong&gt;“The order that we eat food can help impact the glucose response in the body,” says Derocha. She advises eating vegetables and protein before carbohydrate foods (like rice, potatoes or bread) to slow digestion and reduce a spike.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay active: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for 50 minutes of moderate- or vigorous-intensity cardio with resistance exercise to strengthen muscles and bones at least three days per week. Plus, limit sedentary screen time.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;This includes cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products. If you need help quitting, ask your doctor for a referral for treatment for tobacco cessation and possible medication.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improve your sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Relaxing pre-bed routines, keeping a regular bedtime and wake-up time, sleeping in a dark, quiet, cool area, putting your devices on silent and avoiding alcohol before bed all help improve sleep quality—which is necessary for proper blood sugar management.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To blunt a rise in blood sugar after a meal, the most powerful thing you can do is take a short, 10-minute walk right after eating. In addition, hydrating during and after the meal, as well as chasing the meal with a high-fiber fruit, can also help decrease the rise in glucose that happens after eating, as well as support your body’s ability to get rid of glucose. Blood sugar management is an all-day thing, though, so remember to eat balanced meals containing fiber-rich carbohydrates, lean protein and healthy fat, exercise regularly and get good sleep.

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://media.mauinow.com/file/mauinow/2025/12/256545559_l-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-510871"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning Jan. 1, 2026, in accordance with Ordinance 5759 adopted by the Maui County Council, the County of Maui Department of Water Supply (DWS) will implement a new method for projecting water demand and sizing water meters that focuses on daily water usage instead of the Hunter Curve Method, which was based on the number of plumbing fixtures—such as toilets or showers—in a building. The new method will apply to building permit applications and applications for new or additional water use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new approach is a form of the water demand equivalent method, establishes a unit of daily water demand called the Equivalent Single Dwelling (ESD), and estimates daily water consumption based established patterns of human habitation correlating to the number of bedrooms and bathrooms in a home, counting any room that is, or could reasonably be, used for sleeping as a bedroom. In addition to the total ESDs associated with a service, each service will be allocated an additional 0.5 ESD to account for outdoor water use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analyzing empirical local meter data, per-capita usage and national per person daily use averages, DWS developed a model for daily water usage based on a range of bedroom and bathroom combinations accounting for typical household activities such as dishwashing, laundry, bathing and general human consumption. From this analysis, the department established a fixed daily usage unit of 300 gallons per day for one ESD, based on a four-bed, two-bath home&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new method provides a more accurate way to measure water demand, which may show additional available capacity under the 300 gallons per day per ESD standard, but it does not increase the total water supply on Maui. This approach helps DWS plan and manage water resources more realistically while continuing to address the island’s ongoing water challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak mobile-only mobileFullWidth"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1615054580015-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new methodology allows DWS to more accurately measure water demand and ensure properties are appropriately sized for safe and reliable water service,” said DWS Director John Stufflebean. “It supports Maui’s long-term water management goals, helps make the process more straightforward, and reinforces our commitment to serving the community reliably.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Family Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For single-family residences, DWS has established standard meter capacities to simplify the process:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5/8-inch meter: up to 2.5 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;3/4-inch meter: up to 3.5 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;1-inch meter: up to 6 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Family Homes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mn_videoad" class="ad_video ad_video_homepage mobileFullWidth ad_video_v2"&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="mn_videoad_holder"&gt;&lt;video playsinline webkit-playsinline id="vastplayer" muted="muted" loop="true"&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-family projects use the same bedroom-and-bathroom methodology as single-family homes, with outdoor water use estimated separately; however, because multifamily buildings have different water-use patterns than single-family homes, meter sizing is based on modeling using the International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO) Water Demand Calculator (WDC), reflecting their unique water-use patterns. Models of different multifamily projects with varying unit counts were used to develop a sizing curve, which informs DWS’s standard meter table:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For multi-family residences, DWS has established standard meter capacities as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;·         1-inch meter: up to 16 ESD&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5-inch meter: up to 60 ESD&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;2-inch meter: up to 120 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;3-inch meter: up to 240 ESDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developers may use the standard table or submit custom WDC calculations for meter sizing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak mobileFullWidth"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Residential Properties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For non-residential properties, water demand is based on custom calculations prepared and signed by a licensed professional. Developers must provide indoor water-use estimates as well as landscape irrigation calculations, including plant types, the area covered by each type, and anticipated daily or monthly water use. Developers may use the EPA WaterSense Water Budget Calculator to assist with outdoor water estimates. DWS will convert all information into ESDs for permitting and meter sizing, and custom calculations also determine the meter issued along with any associated storage and transmission fees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak mobile-only mobileFullWidth"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1615054580015-0" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="adBreak desktop-only"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="div-gpt-ad-1615054580015-1" class="ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation and Transition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Existing multifamily and non-residential meters retain ESD entitlements based on their current approved use or the FY2026 source fee equivalent of $2,316 per ESD, whichever is greater. DWS will not reduce existing entitlements or require reconciliation for customers whose entitlements exceed fees paid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To assist with the application process, the updated ESD Methodology and a Materials Submission Checklist will be available at &lt;a href="http://www.mauicounty.gov/214/Engineering-Division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;www.mauicounty.gov/214/Engineering-Division&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Applications submitted on or before Dec. 31, 2025, will continue under the current fixture-based method. Applications submitted on or after Jan. 1, 2026, will use the new unit demand methodology. Additional fixtures or ESDs will not be available for purchase under the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;

Past research has also linked a clean and healthy mouth with conditions such as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/oral-health-and-diabetes-have-a-crucial-link-expert-reveals"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-cause-of-one-of-the-deadliest-cancers-might-be-inside-your-mouth"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it encourages you to brush your teeth before bed tonight, think about all the beneficial knock-on effects it could be having on the rest of your health – including reducing the inflammation and preventing the gum disease that could eventually lead to ASCVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brushing, flossing, and regular dental checkups aren't just about a healthy smile – they're an important part of protecting your heart," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/gum-disease-may-be-linked-to-plaque-buildup-in-arteries-higher-risk-of-major-cvd-events"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001390"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

One episode in particular, she says, made an impact: “Unpacking Ultrasound With Yolande Clark.” In it, the Canadian ex-doula Yolande Norris-Clark falsely links ultrasounds to autism and ADHD and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_t0fi47M7o" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;states that&lt;/a&gt; “ultrasound damages and modifies and destroys cells”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="095cc2d4-a2ab-4c92-b82c-76b24583258a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Yolande Norris-Clark in an episode of The Complete Guide to Freebirth.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: FBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark, who was born in Vancouver, is arguably the most famous freebirth influencer in the world.

Most women find FBS through its Instagram account, which has 132,000 followers, or podcast, which has been downloaded 5m times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Norris-Clark is a significant social media influencer in her own right, pioneering a radical version of free birth that concerns even pro-freebirth advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a05cf2da-67e1-4f89-ad4b-0f8d06538477" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emma Cardinal: ‘You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Annika Faith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After listening to the podcast about ultrasounds, Cardinal was alarmed. “I was petrified of miscarriage and stillbirth,” she says, explaining that her younger brother was stillborn. “There’s not a chance I’m risking that.” Cardinal came to believe ultrasounds “aren’t super safe for the baby”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At that stage, Cardinal had not yet decided to freebirth. She phoned a local midwifery practice and explained that she wanted a home birth, but did not want to have any ultrasounds during her pregnancy. But the receptionist, Cardinal recalls, said that if she wanted to give birth with them, ultrasounds were non-negotiable. Cardinal thought about it, and decided she was not comfortable proceeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, after listening to about 100 episodes of the FBS podcast, Cardinal decided to freebirth. In one journal entry, she wrote: “I know it in my bones that freebirthing is my safest and most liberated option.” She purchased FBS’s popular video course, “The Complete Guide to Freebirth”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardinal’s son Floyd was stillborn in March 2024. During labour Cardinal saw meconium in her waters, a possible sign of distress, but dismissed it because “I was told by FBS that meconium is totally normal”. She stayed home for three days, because “I remember hearing Emilee Saldaya’s voice in my head [from the podcasts], saying: ‘I wouldn’t be concerned for the first three days.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After Floyd died, Cardinal was hospitalised with sepsis and placed in an induced coma. She has had a number of surgeries to repair the damage from his birth, and had to wear an ostomy bag for a time. “I didn’t think that could even be a reality that could happen after birth,” she says. “I almost had to have a hysterectomy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d2f96779-40b9-47cc-9067-22cca6fa54f1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emma Cardinal in hospital after her first ostomy surgery, nine months after the stillbirth of Floyd.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Annika Faith&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Looking back, Cardinal believes that much of the information she received from FBS was “incomplete, biased, one-sided and kind of dogmatic”. This includes the information she received on ultrasounds, &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/uog.6328" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;which are not harmful&lt;/a&gt; to unborn babies when used appropriately. She adds: “You can’t just post about the good side of free birth. What happens when it goes very wrong?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark has not responded to repeated requests for comment about the Guardian’s investigation, which is told through &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-birth-keepers-the-guardian-investigates/id1731314182" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;The Birth Keepers podcast series&lt;/a&gt;. She has previously defended her partnership with Saldaya, saying FBS is “the most ethical kind of business you can run”. Critics of FBS, she has said, fail to understand the commitment to women taking “radical responsibility” for their births. And she has said it is unfair to hold her responsible for the choices of a mother who consumes her content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-birth-keepers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the spotlight on tragedies involving mothers&lt;/a&gt; around the world who consumed FBS content is posing a crisis for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Saldaya has also not provided a substantive response to requests for comment, but told the Guardian in one email that “some of these allegations are false or defamatory”. She has previously responded to criticism by saying she does not care if women freebirth, but wants them to have the choice. In recent comments to her followers, she described the Guardian’s reporting as “propaganda” based on “lies”, and suggested her work, words and character had been misrepresented by “twisted, dark attacks”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c3da89e0-6a5e-4f61-ac30-c33a9714c6d0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Emilee Saldaya pictured in a screengrab of the Free Birth Society website.&lt;/span&gt; Composite: FBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cardinal is not the only Canadian woman to lose their child after an FBS-influenced free birth. Although &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; has universal healthcare, it is a sparsely populated country, with large “midwifery deserts”. Alternative communities can be sceptical of licensed professionals. As in other parts of the world, FBS messaging often resonates with women who have had traumatic experiences of maternity services or unnecessary medical interventions&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; The Covid pandemic also eroded many women’s trust in the medical establishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Not all of the women who want to avoid licensed providers are ready to freebirth. Some turn to unlicensed attendants, believing they offer their best chance to avoid hospital for their birth. Canada has a community of unlicensed birth attendants, in part due to the historic status of midwifery in the nation. Unlike other countries with strong cultures of midwifery, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, Canada has lagged behind other developed nations when it comes to recognising midwifery. Midwives and their clients can sometimes encounter scepticism, or even hostility, from healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is in this context that women turn to unlicensed attendants, some of whom, while unregulated, are skilled and experienced underground midwives. But others – such as those who enrolled only in a brief online FBS course – have limited or no experience of births, and no adequate skills for managing potential emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-actually-dont-believe-gravity-is-true" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;‘I actually don’t believe gravity is true’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The most popular of FBS’s schools, the Radical Birthkeeper School, has trained 850 “authentic midwives” from more than 30 countries. On its three-month Zoom course, only about half the content deals with birth, and the rest focuses on self-development and business skills. There are at least 22 FBS-accredited birth keepers in Canada, according to an online directory seen by the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;FBS advises its radical birth keepers – or RBKs – to get out in the world and begin attending births. “The very best way to learn how to do midwifery is by doing midwifery,” Saldaya told her RBK students in 2025. Many have since set up their own businesses supporting women during their free births.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alexandra Smith, 29, a life coach who hired an FBS-trained RBK for her birth, is from Vancouver Island. “It’s a different way of thinking out here. People prefer to be off grid,” Smith explains. “It’s a holistic space, with lots of hippies, everyone is about free birth and Waldorf education.” Norris-Clark, she adds, is “very popular where I live”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She says women in her area see Norris-Clark as the “founding mother” of free birth, who has “brought a solution to systemic problems” in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;During her pregnancy, Smith says, she listened to the FBS podcast regularly, sometimes multiple episodes a day, and that she found Norris-Clark particularly captivating. Were it not for FBS, she says, she would have had a home birth with a midwife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3a1ef88e-4d12-464b-a311-803df2969232" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Alexandra Smith with a painting of her son Aksel.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Odessa Rae&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many of the women who follow Norris-Clark on social media, seeking advice in their pregnancies, are unaware of her more extreme views, which she sometimes revealed to FBS students. “I actually don’t believe that gravity is true,” she told FBS students in 2024, adding: “Maybe that just makes me crazy and that’s totally OK.” In another class, she told students they could cut a baby’s umbilical cord with an “old rusty fork”. “I don’t believe in germ theory,” she said, “I don’t believe in contagion,” adding: “But even if contagion were real … there would be a pretty much 0% chance of anything happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Such radical beliefs are not part of FBS’s slick advertising and promotional materials. Smith says she believed, based on FBS marketing, that RBKs were “trained, unregistered midwives”. “I feel like I was falsely advertised to,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;(Others have made similar complaints about FBS. Earlier this year a lawyer for FBS responded to a consumer protection complaint filed in North Carolina alleging a course was mis-sold by stating that the company had always been transparent that it was offering “personal development and sovereign-birth related education” rather than certified midwifery training.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The RBK who Smith hired to attend her during her free birth was in her mid-20s. In a video testimonial she filmed for the RBK school, which had been available online until recently, she said the school “wasn’t your typical school in that it provides hard facts, information, data, and all of that stuff. It was different in that what I gained from the experience was this deep trust in birth, the deep sense of knowing that birth unfolds beautifully if we just step out of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When it came to the birth, Smith alleges her RBK was woefully underprepared and “like a deer in headlights”. The RBK, Smith says, missed signs her labour was unfolding abnormally. When Smith’s son Aksel was born on 7 May 2023, his umbilical cord was white, and he was floppy and unresponsive. The RBK, she says, did not attempt to resuscitate the baby, and Smith had to tell her to call 911. Aksel was rushed to hospital, and diagnosed with severe hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy due to oxygen deprivation caused by a placental abruption at his birth. The RBK has not responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="legal-cases-and-public-warnings" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Legal cases and public warnings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As unlicensed attendants, including those trained by FBS, proliferate across Canada, the authorities are seeking to clamp down on the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Vancouver Island, Canada’s most famous unlicensed birth attendant, Gloria Lemay, 78, is awaiting trial for manslaughter after a girl died 10 days after her birth, which Lemay attended, in January 2024. It is her latest legal battle in a near five-decade long career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 1986, Lemay was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12289431/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;convicted of criminal negligence&lt;/a&gt; causing death after a baby was born dead at a birth she attended, although she was later acquitted, with the supreme court upholding a lower court’s judgment that a child that is not yet born cannot be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12289431/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;considered a person&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, after a baby boy died of an infection three days after a birth attended by Lemay, she was fined $1,000 for refusing to answer questions at the inquest. In 2002, Lemay &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/lite/story/1.319144" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;was found&lt;/a&gt; in contempt of an order prohibiting her from acting as a midwife. She was arrested in relation to the most recent case in January 2025. A case management conference is scheduled for January 2026. Lemay declined to comment on her upcoming trial, but it is understood she plans to contest the charges and plead not guilty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="e13efbdf-671e-435e-b41e-97d7084ec8db" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-a2pvoh"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Gloria Lemay trained Yolande Norris-Clark as a doula.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Norris-Clark always credits Lemay with inspiring her lifelong passion for birth. Lemay attended Norris-Clark’s first two births, and trained her as a doula. However those familiar with both women’s careers say Norris-Clark’s views on birth are more extreme than those of her one-time mentor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemay remains a highly divisive figure. Viewed by some in the medical establishment as a dangerous charlatan, she is equally beloved by many in the birth world, who regard her as a folk hero comparable to the legendary US midwife Ina May Gaskin. The Birth Care Alliance, a campaign to counter what it says is the “systemic overreach into birth sovereignty and midwifery”, is fundraising for her defence. (So too is Norris-Clark, who has described Lemay’s trial as “the attempted martyrdom of a cherished elder”.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemay’s supporters say she wished to retire years ago, but was repeatedly asked to attend births by women who wanted to give birth outside the system. They say she is highly skilled, supports medical transfer when necessary, and has attended thousands of births in her career, of which only very few ended in tragedy. To her detractors, Lemay is a thorn in the side of the medical establishment, and the authorities have repeatedly targeted her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But Canadian health authorities are also warning about less famous, and considerably less skilled, attendants, some of whom are FBS-affiliated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In 2023 the British Columbia College of Nurses and Midwives put out an advisory notice warning the public about the RBK hired by Smith, saying she was not entitled to practise as a midwife, and that she could be offering midwifery services without being permitted to do so. (The Guardian has seen no evidence that she continued to attend births after Smith’s in May 2023.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The following year, a different FBS-linked birth attendant was banned from hospitals across Alberta unless she was seeking medical care for herself or her family. The woman, who marketed herself as a “traditional midwife”, had been a member of the FBS membership community and appeared as a guest on its podcast. A number of complaints were filed against her by concerned staff at two Calgary hospitals after she was linked to two stillbirths in 2021. (Her lawyer told the Guardian that her birth services have been limited to non-medical support.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Smith’s son Aksel spent five weeks in hospital before being discharged in June 2023. Deprived of oxygen during birth, he had severe disabilities and was fed through a tube. Smith was his full-time carer. “You’re just trying to wrap your head around what happened,” she recalls of that time, “and my mental state was: how do we find a cure, how do we fix this?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She goes on: “It’s very lonely having a medically complex child in a holistic community. When things go awry, it’s like it’s your fault.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aksel lived for six and a half months, before he died. “In my grief,” says Smith, “it’s hard to think about how things could have been different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizwFBVV95cUxPbHNyc2pXSVQ2R2hwTVZkUlVtN19UWWVXc0ZDdW5nZHp2azJNMzN5Q1c5ZWd6MUhLcy1qWEtzY0Z0Yi1Cc3BPbWpPNTAwQUUwcnpfMnpiT2pfZkRMbEtlYUpfTmhGRVR3dVdmdWFQQjRqTDE5RlBZOGZ5Nk4zMXRybnRZS0dsY3QyS1J3RGx0b0xHWDVVTmU1Z0gwRzZER0JJRTdrOFRhQnRRc1RPblZ4MXJBQ1N2QmdmVVRhNlo2R1NFV2oySWlvM0xua2VhenM</guid></item></channel></rss>
