His 4-year-old son was at risk because he had received only the first of the vaccine’s two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NOZP23QHEJH5TDFEBL7PI7QPTQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So, in mid-March, he took his family to a primary care clinic at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LXPHWXPXO5GRHGEX5CGOBJOCGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;By the end of the visit, his son, Anh Hoang, had received one shot protecting against four illnesses — measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox. He also received a second shot against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough, as well as a flu shot. His twin daughters, who had already had their measles vaccinations, got other immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RV3DNBQMZ5H3PB56YH7FEYLVMQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nguyen, who is a UTMB postdoctoral fellow in public health and infectious disease, said he asked clinic staff whether his family’s insurance would cover the checkups and immunizations.

Today the vaccine against chicken pox, or varicella, is sometimes combined into what is known as the MMRV vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4SJ5AUHKLFCP3MMB3OBYBHSSTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A first dose of the MMR or MMRV vaccine is usually given between 12 and 15 months, with a second between ages 4 and 6. Experts may recommend vaccinating children at younger ages during an outbreak — like the ongoing U.S. measles outbreak, which has led to more than 1,200 cases, 750 of them in Texas. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 95 percent of the cases have occurred in unvaccinated people or those whose vaccine status is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZUVSXHMUJFFCNLIUGKHR2ZWTZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Recommendations affecting administration and insurance coverage are made by the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;. In June, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the committee, adding vaccine skeptics. The new panel, which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/06/25/rfk-jr-vaccine-panel-acip-meeting/" target="_blank"&gt;met last week&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to scrutinize past recommendations, including for the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="Y44O6TEG3VCPVLI6TSE7GDLAFU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The final bill&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DQ3WPBOID5F2LADVT4ZLKJQV3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;UTMB billed $2,532 for the boy’s office visit and three shots. The MMRV shot alone was billed at $1,422, plus $161 for administering it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="7USLNIZBVZCRHJNYUIDFH6OODI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="7USLNIZBVZCRHJNYUIDFH6OODI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The billing problem: coverage gaps and provider ‘errors’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OQAKNYDVVVFBDOPBO3P6KLX74U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are guardrails in the U.S. health system intended to prevent recommended vaccines from being prohibitively expensive. They did not help the Nguyen family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WTOOCDMKEBESRAQLWPJIL4FDFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Their health plan, purchased from &lt;a href="https://taianfinancial.com/" target="_blank"&gt;insurance broker TaiAn&lt;/a&gt; for Nguyen’s wife and children and administered by the &lt;a href="https://www.imglobal.com/" target="_blank"&gt;International Medical Group&lt;/a&gt;, does not cover immunizations. And, initially, the family was not offered assistance under the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt;, a federally funded effort created after a measles outbreak more than 30 years ago, that provides free immunizations for uninsured and underinsured children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5PJW44JCBVERRAI5BK2I4DSVRU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;So the family was exposed to the sticker shock of U.S. medical care without insurance, with providers setting prices. In this case, UTMB’s price for the child’s MMRV shot was about $1,400, more than five times what the CDC says it costs in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="67SM7W32KVCUJISP7VIUAXOQLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nguyen was surprised when their insurer did not pay anything, leaving bills for his three children’s checkups that, combined, were close to $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4RKVJ32NDBARZPW64UPABHDGNU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He said the family’s income from his job in UTMB’s labs is less than $57,000 a year. Nguyen’s job provides him health insurance, but he balked at the $615 per month it would cost to cover his family, too, and instead purchased the one-year policy from TaiAn, which totaled $1,841. The policy covers certain types of office visits, emergency room care, hospitalization and chemotherapy, but not immunizations or checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AW5ZBPFYDBHIVITIXPQSPP4RBQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Nguyen and his wife, who are from Vietnam, are living in the country on temporary visas while he completes his studies. In Vietnam, Nguyen said, the total cost of the preventive care his family received at the clinic would probably be no more than $300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UK5EMEWGLRBAVCJB7NNNJF63QU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He was concerned about the high prices set by the clinic for the vaccines, particularly during a measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XWDOHOQLPJCUVCBV3ZCBCOHIEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Carly Kessler, spokesperson for the International Medical Group, confirmed in an email to KFF Health News that the family’s plan does not cover preventive care, including immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KFFAXPJEOVGHNIPQ4U5YD3VRXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After UTMB was contacted by KFF Health News, its vice president of clinical contracting strategies, Kent Pickering, looked into the matter. “This situation should not have happened” but did so because of “a series of errors,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="B6DKWSAVBBF4BE2OEY3LKLQ4IY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Most insurance offered in the United States must cover, without co-pays, a variety of preventive care services — including the measles vaccine — under &lt;a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/preventive-care-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;rules in the Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;. But some plans are exempt from those rules, including short-term plans or travel insurance. International students on temporary visas do not have to buy an ACA-compliant plan during their first five years in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FG6ZCTTBYZBZRLTUYJET657LMY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But what about the cost of the vaccines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WWW2R5A7ANCHTNBCCGQB32644Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hospitals and other providers may set their own prices for services, creating price lists called chargemasters.

Consumer prices for ProQuad at Galveston-area pharmacies range from about $285 to $326, according to the prescription cost-tracking website GoodRx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A2UDWUUHFBHPTE75JM26F6BIXM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;UTMB’s Pickering told KFF Health News that, initially, the Nguyen family’s insurance was entered incorrectly by the clinic staff, so they did not pick up that his plan didn’t cover vaccines. If they had, UTMB probably would have checked whether the Texas Vaccines for Children Program would cover the cost of the shots, charging only the program’s small administration fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="76WPVTR37JHZNFNXHUQZYMPTTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A second error was uncovered when Pickering looked into the bill. He said UTMB’s chargemaster had been updated a few months earlier and the vaccine prices for those who do not receive shots through the children’s vaccine program were listed at incorrectly high amounts, resulting in the price Nguyen’s son was charged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="G2OAIIM5PRBEVD3C3TDGNLBAWE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Pickering said the prices had been corrected, though he declined to cite exact figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="TRC7DVJ62JCVXPRUE7YJDIIBEQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="TRC7DVJ62JCVXPRUE7YJDIIBEQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The resolution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QMXO4EBYNVAN5O47RL3XENKR2Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In addition to contacting the insurer, Nguyen approached the financial offices at UTMB, asking for a reduction or waiver of the fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RVIMNZG4QNBB3AINTDCY3QN3PA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In mid-May, UTMB sent Nguyen a revised bill for his son’s office visit. It applied a 50 percent self-pay discount, which its website says is offered to those who are uninsured. His revised total was $1,266, $711 of which was for the MMRV vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PKNC4D5F75H2ZHWKWVSYISIMZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I expected them to waive the vaccination cost for my children or at least reduce it more, especially for MMRV vaccine,” said Nguyen, noting that his family would still be strapped trying to pay their bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5J4ZLOOZUVHNNB222URLBFY63Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After Pickering spoke with KFF Health News, a customer service representative contacted Nguyen, waiving the cost of the vaccines.

That decision came after discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, which is grappling with a massive overhaul under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new data, the company plans to resubmit the application for the combination vaccine and file for approval of its standalone flu shot later this year, Stephen Hoge, the company's head of research and development, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If regulators approve the flu vaccine, the company can then advance the combination shot, Hoge said. He added that Moderna expects approvals for both shots next year pending reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the combination jab simplifies vaccination, which will "help the health-care system" by reducing workloads of doctors and nurses, slashing costs and improving uptake among patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company so far appears to be the frontrunner in the race against &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/NVAX/"&gt;Novavax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to bring a combination shot to the market. While Moderna does not have specific revenue projections for its individual products, Hoge said Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus are each multi-billion-dollar markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're obviously hoping that our products allow us to earn our fair share of them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phase three trial followed more than 40,000 adults ages 50 and above, who were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Moderna's shot, called mRNA-1010, or a standard competitor vaccine. Moderna's shot was 26.6% more effective than the other vaccine in the overall study population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA-1010 jab also demonstrated strong efficacy for each of the major influenza strains in the shot, including A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and the B/Victoria lineages. Moderna said the vaccine's benefit was consistent across different age groups, people with various risk factors and previous vaccination status against the flu. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adults ages 65 and older, the shot was 27.4% more effective than the standard flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficacy results are "a significant milestone in our effort to reduce the burden of influenza in older adults," Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a release. "The severity of this past flu season underscores the need for more effective vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderna cited &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html" target="_blank"&gt;data &lt;/a&gt;from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that seasonal flu-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits reached a 15-year high during the 2024 to 2025 season of the virus.&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/data-vis/2024-2025.html#:~:text=The%20estimates%20on%20this%20page,have%20ranged%20from%20120%2C000%2D710%2C000" target="_blank"&gt; More than 600,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; were hospitalized due to flu-related illness last year, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA-1010 vaccine's safety data was consistent with previous results from another phase three study on the shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Moderna are down more than 30% for the year, fueled in large part by a string of moves by the Trump administration to change vaccine policy and undermine immunizations. The administration in May &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cancels-more-700-million-funding-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine-2025-05-28/" target="_blank"&gt;canceled&lt;/a&gt; a contract awarded to Moderna for the late-stage development of its bird flu vaccine for humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S., Hoge said Moderna is engaging closely with the FDA to understand what its requirements are and how to satisfy them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I believe, as relates to flu, I think we've got a pretty clear path," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="ArticleBody-MobileAdhesion" class="MobileAdhesion-container" data-module="mps-slot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 11:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPQVpMcUZENjFQVy1RUXhCdUp6ZXBpenJfZ29wUWdvazRBcG1pN21NUm5hOXFoZjgyaHZ2SnJEYmo3OXhyQUdpTEVUbG9ueERVZVVHeElEQTJLYTdJTDEyWW1OcWg0bjlRWjVwbHdKQXRJYWtMSHFkSVRfRkFud3hZalJOUGdGX3Z4c2hTano0cWhHZmw1eEc1WWt1cTFueENXcWlmck4zXy1NVlhCUW5YeDZB0gG3AUFVX3lxTE44cUlVVDNYbE9QMkhRS3FtU09xdFZrLXJENjFQVDVIZEh0eDlRZTRrU0FqcmxFLU1KWk1xclZSQ3ZYQThvbElkYWJBSFhlVUNUT2g5NkwtT3ZYRTJtNjYySkVhUVlzMDFFZS1oQWJPTG1BMEFrYVZYNUZTeFFaTVZ6ZmFqX1FGYWdDT1YtTVdhUXpYYnFKOUc0VzZoUEJ2RE5QelBjSFlMLW9HMFVyb1RUdEVLZEdaaw</guid></item><item><title>SCURR博士揭示了如何控制握手，因为他揭示了震颤可以预示的令人担忧的疾病-每日邮报 | DR SCURR reveals how to control shaking hands as he reveals the worrying disease tremors can herald - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxPcTFmenkyVnBvdk1GRGlMUWdLR0duZlRYekVpNE5oOURiOG5ONFBJc3ZFZkUyVVFPYTluRkxIeFZWa2t0NjUyYWdjVllQdDhGXy1MOHpKcXpZUW1xZm92cGhjUm02Mkp2cDRjMlktbDNIb2JzRzNLdy1CWXRRcVQzRC0zZVFhYURSajZRWXhCelVCT05KdnJTVmo1RVlSTzZiMEZuckpuTmVGRXB5TUJuQlBXaXZudndfdXY4SFc1MGp0SG4zdGRSWUN0SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;For the past three months, I have experienced a shaking right hand on occasions. My left hand is fine. I’m using a wrist support at night but it doesn’t seem to make a difference. People are starting to notice the tremor. What could be causing it? I’m 77 and reasonably fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Kay Thornton, Watford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies:&lt;/span&gt; There are multiple causes of tremor – the most common is essential tremor. This is a neurological disorder which typically affects the hands – but the head and body may also be involved – and while it’s not in itself dangerous, it does tend to get worse over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can affect any age, but it typically occurs after the age of 40, though the cause is not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medication to help manage the symptoms is essentially aimed at calming down the nervous system and includes drugs such as beta-blockers or gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medication can also cause tremor and you mention in your longer letter that you are on the antidepressant sertraline, which can, albeit in rare circumstances, be a trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a drug-induced tremor is unlikely to involve only one hand – plus, you say you’ve been taking that drug without side-effects for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another possible cause of a tremor is Parkinson’s disease. In this case it often starts on one side, in the hand or at the wrist and the tremor improves with movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One possible cause of a tremor is Parkinson’s disease, which often starts on one side in the hand or at the wrist and the tremor improves with movement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One thing to note is that loss of smell, or anosmia, can occur even years before a tremor is observed in Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 90 per cent of people with Parkinson’s experience some degree of this – although I note you don’t mention issues with smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My advice is that you must discuss the symptoms with your GP, perhaps requesting referral to a neurologist for an expert opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold"&gt;When I last used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) aged 50, I had terrible depression and weight gain and had to come off it. Now my doctor has recommended using an oestrogen vaginal gel to combat poor urine flow. Should I try it again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Name and address supplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies:&lt;/span&gt; In a word, yes! Your GP has given you exactly the advice that I would have given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You say in your longer letter that you are experiencing poor urine flow, meaning it takes a long time to empty the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oestrogen, applied locally, helps improve the health of the tissue in the area and so improve flow. (Tissue changes related to the drop in oestrogen can result in the urethra – the tube which drains from the bladder – kinking to some degree.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HRT can cause the side-effects you describe and, in your longer letter, you say this was the case – even when you switched to a locally-applied vaginal oestrogen gel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, your experience is surprising – I have never seen this in my own practice – and it may be that the preparations you used in the past contained preservatives or stabilising agents that you were particularly sensitive to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite your previous adverse experience, I urge you to try an oestrogen gel again because if it’s successful and side-effect free, it’s likely to make a considerable difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If I’m wrong – and you do suffer an adverse reaction – then at least you can cease applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perhaps it might be sensible to ask your GP to start you at a low dose, given your understandable concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-b78e7910-558e-11f0-b35c-9d25bdf4b749" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14860069/What-hands-starts-shaking-develop-tremor-reveals-DR-SCURR-worrying-disease.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;In My View... Don't ignore sudden hearing loss &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muffled hearing can be brought on by all manner of things – but sudden, unexplained hearing loss must never be ignored as, in some cases, without urgent treatment, the hearing loss can become permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common cause of sudden hearing loss is a viral infection (e.g. measles, mumps, flu) leading to damage to the inner ear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have noticed an increase in cases linked to Covid, but in truth there are plenty of examples where sudden hearing loss occurs out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those affected need urgent treatment with steroids – preferably prednisolone tablets, 60mg daily – as this brings the best chance of recovery with normal hearing gradually regained. (Steroids reduce damaging inflammation that may otherwise impact hearing nerves.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I’m flagging this so that anybody who experiences hearing loss in one ear doesn’t wait too long before being seen – a problem in this era when getting a GP appointment can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But sudden hearing loss in one ear is an emergency. The ear must be inspected promptly, certainly within seven days, and treatment with steroids really is essential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It's benign because we've got vaccination', Lord Vallance told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/parents-have-forgotten-that-measles-kills-says-lord-vallance-frjzbz3sb"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 65-year-old added that to see people—most often children—die from entirely preventable disease was 'tragic'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'People used to have 12 children because they knew five were going to die. It doesn't happen like that anymore and vaccination has been a major part of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles usually starts with flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough and runny nose and is often followed by a tell-tale rash which starts on the face and behind the ears before spreading to the rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can trigger more serious and even fatal health complications if it spreads to the lungs or the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dubbed 'the world's most infectious disease', it can spread to nine in 10 unvaccinated children in a classroom if just one classmate is carrying the bug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lord Vallance, the Government's chief scientific adviser during the pandemic, is urging parents to get their children vaccinated against potentially life-threatening childhood diseases &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles. A few days later, some people develop small white spots on the inside of their cheeks and the back of their lips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in five children who catch the disease will be hospitalised, according to estimates, with one in 15 developing life-threatening complications like meningitis or sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lord Vallance was speaking in the wake of a surge in measles in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles cases soared in 2024 with 2,911 cases confirmed in England—the highest number on record since 2012—and tragically one death recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite surging rates of infections uptake of a vaccine designed to protect children against the disease has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less than 84 per cent of five-year-olds in the nation had both recommended doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have labelled the figures concerning and urged parents to vaccinate their children to avoid the 'life-long consequences' of potential measles infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not just the MMR jab.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lord Vallance's warning comes as data shows none of the 14 childhood vaccines offered on the NHS met the 95 per cent uptake target needed for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts labelled the figures as concerning and urged parents to vaccinate their children to avoid the 'life-long consequences' of a potential measles infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Herd immunity is a public health concept where enough people are vaccinated that it stops diseases spreading rampantly through the population as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have blamed post-pandemic scepticism and vaccine fatigue for the rapidly declining rates, with Vallance also pointing the finger at, now &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12319495/Disgraced-ex-doctor-cum-godfather-anti-vaxx-movement-Andrew-Wakefield-returns-old-tricks-Andrew-Wakefield-urging-parents-not-kids-jabs-new-podcast-sparking-fury-medics.html"&gt;thoroughly debunked&lt;/a&gt;, rumours linking the MMR jab to autism for causing 'huge problems around the world'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, together with health chiefs, he is urging parents to get their children vaccinated—with two doses of the MMR jab offering up to 99 per cent protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as concerning figures released last week revealed nearly half of children in some parts of England haven't had both MMR jabs by the time they turn five. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data shows just 52.7 per cent of youngsters that age in Kensington and Chelsea in west London are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;London remains one of the least vaccinated parts of the country—taking up a staggering 19 of the top 20 spots for low MMR jab uptake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Outside of London, Nottingham was worst with just 71.4 per cent of children jabbed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Doug Brown, Chief Executive of the British Society for Immunology, told MailOnline: 'Vaccination is the safest and most effective way to protect your child against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles is a serious disease that can make children very ill and cause life-long consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the 2024 measles outbreak in England, one in five children who contracted the disease needed to be admitted to hospital for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To be fully protected against contracting measles, it is essential that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine at the correct timepoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need to redouble efforts to implement the NHS Vaccine Strategy and engage with communities to ensure that all children receive the MMR vaccine and are protected against these nasty diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is never too late to get vaccinated—if you're concerned that your child has missed out on a vaccination, contact your GP surgery.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lord Vallance became a household name during the Covid pandemic, appearing next to Boris Johnson and his chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty during tense Downing Street briefings to talk the nation through the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he also earned the nicknamed 'Dr Doom' during the period for being the face of bleak projections from scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:22:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>喝了一杯啤酒，网球冠军就喝醉了……这是致命癌症在年轻人中上升的迹象--《每日邮报》 | Tennis champ gets tipsy after one beer...it was a sign of deadly cancer that's rising in young people -

I told him I was driving, and he asked me to pull over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Then I knew it was bad news. He said they suspected cancer.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In February 2024, Simon underwent a successful operation to remove both the initial and secondary lumps in his neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Four months later he began a year-long course of immunotherapy to prevent recurrence and started a regular schedule of routine MRI and CT scans to monitor for changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within nine months the cancer had spread to his brain—and suddenly some of the symptoms he had been experiencing began to make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simon said: 'To be honest, I didn't feel right in my head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started having blurred vision again, and I couldn't switch off at night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Simon with one of his tennis students—since his diagnosis with brain cancer he's been unable to hold a racket &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The following month, Simon underwent a highly targetted form of radiotherapy to blast the tumour in his brain, and eventually resumed immunotherapy drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after just one dose of the drug in March 2025, Simon became violently ill and was unable to use the toilet due to his bowel not functioning properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was hospitalised for 10 days and placed on a high dose of steroids to help combat the symptoms, which caused severe nerve damage to his legs and hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simon said: 'I felt numb, battered. It was like I'd been hit by a truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've got wobbly legs now and a right hand that can barely grip a racket, let alone type. But I'm still trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That hospital stay nearly broke me. When I got home, I'd just burst into tears for days. It stripped away everything that felt like me.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Simon is currently taking a pause from treatment and meeting with his oncology team to determine the next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half of those with melanoma that's spread to other parts of the body will not survive longer than five years, according to studies.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Simon has been supported by his wife Tracey, and has started a GoFundMe &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Melanoma is caused by cellular damage from UV and UVB rays from the sun and tanning beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And recent research suggests that the disease is on the rise in younger people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, researchers from the US found that cases of five particular cancers were rising in adults under 50: melanoma, along with cervical cancer, stomach cancer, cancer of the bones and joints, and plasma cell neoplasms—a type of cancer affecting the lymph system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, seperate UK studies have identified a seven per cent rise in young people, aged 25-49 over the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common misconception is that melanoma solely affects the skin on the face, body, and limbs, but it can also develop on other areas vulnerable to sun damage—the mouth, scalp, nail beds, soles of the feet, palm of the hands and fingers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To avoid the disease, experts advise using sunscreen with a high SPF, applying it 30 minutes before going outside, covering up as much as possible to avoid sunburn, and keeping babies and children out of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In May, Simon launched a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/simon-bowler-the-start-of-my-journey-and-only-17-months-in"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt;, which has now raised nearly £7,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's using the funds to start a new business selling tennis accessories and plans to donate a portion of sales to Macmillan, the NHS, and mental health charities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's OK to cry,' he said. 'It's OK to admit you're not OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've been stripped of a lot of my identity—but I haven't lost my will to keep going.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just want to get back to helping people, mentoring young players, and showing them what resilience looks like.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Vegans do not eat any foods derived from animals.

"So, if you're eating a steak you're getting a lot of protein, iron, zinc and some micronutrients from that beef." However, Amati points out that along with those things, you're also getting saturated fat and certain chemicals like carnitine – a nutrient which plays a role in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Carnitine-HealthProfessional/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt; – and which is thought to increase inflammation in the gut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Whereas, if you look at, say, an edamame [a type of young, immature soybean] you're getting good amounts of protein, but you're also getting fibre, and bioactive compounds that are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2024.1488772/full" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;beneficial for health&lt;/a&gt; such as vitamins, minerals and polyphenols," says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So far, so good for veganism – as long as you have a balanced diet.

Two-thirds of the vegan and vegetarian children in the study took vitamin B12 supplements, but overall vegan children had lower calcium levels and were at greater risk of iron, vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study showed that vegan children's health differed in several ways from omnivorous kids who ate meat and dairy. The good news was that vegan children were leaner and had lower cholesterol levels, which could potentially lead to a lower risk of heart disease later in life. They also showed reduced signs of inflammation in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="6.-vegan-children-might-be-slightly-less-tall" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="6.-vegan-children-might-be-slightly-less-tall" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;6. Vegan children might be slightly less tall &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The less good news was that vegan children were between 3-4cm (1.2-1.6in) shorter on average than omnivorous kids, although they were still a normal height for their age. "They have a tendency to be slightly smaller and lighter, but we don't know if those vegan children are going to catch up when they're teenagers," says Desmond.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The most concerning finding, however, was that vegan children had a 6% lower bone mineral density than omnivores. This could put them at risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures in later life. "We only have a short window where we build our bones, which is up until the age of around 25 to 30," says Desmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250616-143050-043f96f72f-web-2.23.1-5/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lltd54.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images As with omnivorous diets, it's best to steer clear of ultra-processed foods where possible (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;As with omnivorous diets, it's best to steer clear of ultra-processed foods where possible (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"From then on, our bone mineral content goes downwards. So, if you do not build as much as possible until the age 25, you're going down the hill from a much smaller amount of mineral in your bones."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Research on adult vegans and vegetarians also suggests that they have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-abstract/77/1/1/5146363" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;lower bone mineral density&lt;/a&gt; than omnivores, putting them at higher risk of bone fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, the reason for the mineral deficit isn't fully understood. Both vitamin D and calcium are essential for building and maintaining healthy bones, however Desmond points out that although the vegan children in her 2021 study had lower calcium intakes than vegetarian and omnivore children, it was only slightly lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think it's a combination of factors," says Desmond. "I don't think it's as easily solved as taking a calcium pill, because it could be due to the quality of plant protein, which is less growth promoting than animal protein."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Eating more animal protein is thought to stimulate the release of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522035365?via%3Dihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;certain growth factors&lt;/a&gt;. These molecules – usually proteins – can send signals to the body to encourage it to grow faster. Growth factors play a crucial role in making bones stronger and are involved in both bone growth and repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, Amati points out that these results are just from one study, and therefore the link between a vegan diet in childhood and bone density is yet to be definitively proven. "I think it's an important study, but it's one study on a small amount of children. So, what this study says to me is that we need to actually do more research to really understand what factors in their diet are putting children at higher risk," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="7.-a-carefully-planned-vegan-diet-is-probably-safe-for-children" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="7.-a-carefully-planned-vegan-diet-is-probably-safe-for-children" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;7.

"I'd say based on what we know now, we can say a vegan diet [in childhood] is safe, but needs to be done responsibly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This view is shared by Tom Sanders, emeritus professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, who has researched vegan diets since the 1970s. "We showed &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://anthropogoniques.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/growth-of-british-vegan-children-sanders-1988.pdf" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;years ago&lt;/a&gt; that kids could be brought up in on vegan diet, providing you avoided the known pitfalls," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, what are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/the-vegan-diet/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the best foods to eat&lt;/a&gt; to make sure you are maximising your intake of nutrients normally found in meat and dairy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="8.-some-foods-are-fortified-with-important-nutrients,-such-as-b12,-calcium-and-vitamin-d" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="8.-some-foods-are-fortified-with-important-nutrients,-such-as-b12,-calcium-and-vitamin-d" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;8.

"Absorption [of iron] can be a bit less efficient, but that can be overcome if you pair it with vitamin C-rich foods like peppers, tomatoes and citrus fruits," says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For the omega-3 fatty acids, flax seeds, chia seeds and walnuts are good sources of ALA, while vegans can take omega-3 supplements made from seaweed and algae to maximise their intake of EPA and DHA – the omega-3 oils found in fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="9.-it's-best-to-avoid-ultra-processed-vegan-food-where-possible" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="9.-it's-best-to-avoid-ultra-processed-vegan-food-where-possible" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;9.

"We do sometimes see people who have vegan diets, but they're just buying vegan cheese, and vegan chicken nuggets, so the quality of their diet is still poor," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"If you have an unhealthy vegan diet where you're not thinking about the variety of nutrients, and you're just taking supplements, then you won't have good health outcomes," says Amati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="10.-doing-your-research-is-important" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="10.-doing-your-research-is-important" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;10.

This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/easy-anti-inflammatory-dinner-recipes-11756624" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory recipes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 318 to 335 calories, while the lunches span 341 to 414 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between natural and added sugars?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural sugars are found in fruits, vegetables and dairy. Added sugars are any type of sugar, even "natural" ones like honey and maple syrup, that are added during food processing. Unlike added sugars, which are added purely for sweetness and have little nutritional value, natural sugars are found in foods that provide beneficial nutrients, like fiber, protein, vitamins and minerals. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/67340/how-to-cut-back-on-sneaky-added-sugars/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Added sugars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in our diets can add up because they're often found in foods we wouldn't necessarily expect, like sauces, marinades, cereals and flavored yogurts. It is recommended that you limit added sugars in the diet to no more than 25 grams per day for women and 36 grams per day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Health Benefits of an Anti-Inflammatory Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An anti-inflammatory diet is one that includes foods that fight inflammation in the body. These are foods that contain antioxidants, like beta-carotene and anthocyanins, foods containing omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon and walnuts, and foods that promote a healthy microbiome, such as probiotics, prebiotics and dietary fiber. Chronic inflammation is a contributor to the onset and progression of many chronic conditions, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and obesity. Choosing foods that help to reduce inflammation in the body can help prevent and manage chronic conditions. In addition, excess intake of added sugars can lead to increased risk of chronic low-grade inflammation, so opt for foods with naturally occurring sugars that are also paired with inflammation-fighting nutrients, like colorful fruits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How We Create Meal Plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitians thoughtfully create &lt;em&gt;EatingWell’s&lt;/em&gt; meal plans to be easy-to-follow and delicious. Each meal plan meets specific parameters depending on the health condition and/or lifestyle goal it is targeting and is analyzed for accuracy using the nutrition database, ESHA Food Processor. As nutritional needs differ from person to person, we encourage you to use these plans as inspiration and adjust as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-no-sugar-high-protein-anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-11757370" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jun 2025 08:34:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZEFVX3lxTE9MSlE3U005YjlWUmxwd1VKM280b000VGVzY1V4djkyU1hsX0txd3hiQ3dhLUhoVThxQVFKbjBYbHYteWhxdXE1bXNQcnREa0V5S2xLaHFCZzhZRkRmTnpaMk9mWWE</guid></item><item><title>我们向营养师询问了他们最喜欢的高蛋白零食-这里是前9名- health.com | We Asked Dietitians Their Favorite High- Protein Snacks—Here's The Top 9 - health.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNVWliRkNEM085T0lKWkpjelBUZ0ZudTY1TmVnNWh5R1JiVDMwTW9yaDMtd0pTd0lJZWxTMjhMZ3F2TVlOZ1JWektZTUY0SHNYZ1B3X04wcmRidTlvUi1jMHRzandSZk8xVjd2UlZ2bE1uUko1R19uQlJoeGJ3c0s0c2V3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is an important nutrient that improves satiety (the feeling of fullness), muscle repair, and blood sugar control.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Store aisles are packed with protein-rich snacks, but how do you know which options are &lt;strong&gt;actually healthy?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some gut health supplements lack research and may do more harm than good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts recommend food first: fiber, fermented foods and variety support your microbiome.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always talk to a health care professional before trying OTC enzymes or antacids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health isn’t just about good digestion. A healthy gut microbiome—the colony of bacteria and other microorganisms living in your intestines—is also important for immune health, heart health, brain health and more. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods you eat&lt;/a&gt; can significantly impact the makeup of your gut microbiota, for better or worse. But what role do supplements play in gut health? 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many supplements promise to heal your gut, but research does not support many of these claims. We spoke to nutrition experts to find out what you should and shouldn’t do for gut health. Registered dietitians encourage a food-first approach instead of relying on expensive, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;unregulated supplements&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotic supplements often claim to improve health by restoring healthy gut bacteria and some research suggests they may help reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For probiotics to be effective, you need to take the right strain at the right dose for your condition. Probiotics may worsen symptoms in many people with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO),” says &lt;a href="http://www.goodgutnutritionist.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kerry Conlon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to &lt;a href="https://dietitianinsights.com/dietitians/kelsey-costa-ms-rdn" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kelsey Costa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, most people can “cultivate a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; by engaging in regular exercise and consuming a diet rich in whole, minimally processed foods.” Since they are supplements, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate probiotics. Over-the-counter probiotics available in pharmacies and stores may not be high quality, and it’s even possible that some products may not contain the probiotic bacteria listed on the label.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-greens-powders"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Greens Powders &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many greens powders claim to improve gut and overall health; however, there isn’t much research to back up these claims. One thing most &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8036275/greens-powder-benefits/#toc-what-are-greens-powders-and-are-they-healthy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;greens powders&lt;/a&gt; don’t provide is dietary fiber. Conlon says, “Relying on powders for nutrients instead of whole fruits and vegetables deprives your body of fiber, an essential nutrient for gut health.” Fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria and promotes digestion and nutrient absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-digestive-enzymes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Digestive Enzymes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over-the-counter digestive enzymes are often thought to relieve acid reflux, gas and bloating. The market for these products is substantial, but it's not known if they are safe or effective since they are unregulated by the FDA and limited research is available.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The body naturally produces digestive enzymes to help break down food. “Most people don’t need to supplement with digestive enzymes unless they have certain medical conditions, like cystic fibrosis or liver problems,” explains &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Costa, “The precise ingredients, dosage and potency of digestive enzyme products could vary significantly without any guaranteed outcomes or firm understanding of potential side effects.” Costa recommends talking to your health care provider before taking OTC digestive enzymes. Even then, take only the specific enzyme supplements directed by your health care provider and watch for potential side effects.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Antacids—an OTC remedy for treating heartburn, acid reflux and indigestion—work by neutralizing stomach acid, providing quick relief from discomfort. “While antacids are technically medications and not supplements, they are widely available OTC and are overused by many,” says Costa.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research suggests that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)—a commonly used type of antacid—may significantly change the makeup of the gut microbiome. This may result in an overgrowth of harmful gut bacteria, changes in nutrient absorption and inappropriate immune responses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; PPIs should only be used as needed, as directed by a health care provider.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to a recent review from &lt;em&gt;Gut Microbes&lt;/em&gt;, polyphenols and probiotics found in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; and the growth of good gut bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For a healthy gut, focus on consuming a variety of plant-based foods while limiting foods high in added sugar and saturated fat. On your next shopping trip, Sauceda suggests picking up a fruit, veggie or grain you haven’t had in a while.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aim to consume at least 25 grams of fiber daily and eat lots of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/281916/must-eat-fermented-foods-for-a-healthy-gut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fermented foods&lt;/a&gt;, like kefir, sauerkraut and kombucha. Fermented foods naturally contain probiotics that support gut health, while fiber feeds beneficial gut bacteria. Add a fruit, vegetable or whole grain to each meal and snack to help you hit your fiber goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gut health is best achieved through a healthy lifestyle including eating a balanced and variety-filled diet, regularly exercising, getting enough quality sleep and managing stress in a healthy way. Instead of spending money on expensive supplements that might not be effective, eat a balanced diet that is high in fiber and low in added sugars and saturated fats. Focus on including a variety of plant-based and fermented foods.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most adults don’t consume enough fiber, but incorporating fiber-rich foods like raspberries can be an easy and delicious solution. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Raspberries are not only packed with fiber, but are also packed with vitamin C and antioxidants. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low in FODMAPs, raspberries are gentle on sensitive stomachs, making them a perfect option for those with IBS or digestive issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although we're supposed to shoot for 25 to 38 grams of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-much-fiber-should-you-be-eating-11752876" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt; per day, more than 90% of women and 97% of men are not meeting this recommendation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And while it might seem more pressing to keep an eye on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;how much protein&lt;/a&gt; you're eating—or whatever appears to be the "hot" macronutrient of the moment—making an effort to eat enough fiber is never going out of style. This is because &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;evidence suggests eating enough fiber&lt;/a&gt; can benefit several areas of our health—including gut health, digestion, bone strength, weight, risk for several chronic diseases and even longevity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We're not talking about suffering through glasses of water mixed with a chalky fiber supplement, though.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most potent sources of fiber is a sweet, versatile, tasty fruit that's an &lt;em&gt;EatingWell &lt;/em&gt;editor favorite. It turns out that the same fruit is also a gut-health doctor-recommended option and might be the all-around best fruit for gut health, according to a February 8, 2023, Instagram reel from &lt;a href="https://theplantfedgut.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Will Bulsiewicz, M.D&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--instagram"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So what is the best fruit for gut health? Raspberries.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "I'm a huge fan of raspberries … First off, they're friggin' delicious," Bulsiewicz shares in the caption. "I mean, seriously. They are like candy, how are they so healthy? But they are!" In the reel, Bulsiewicz continues, "They're super high in fiber. A cup of raspberries has about 7 g of fiber—that's like half of what the average American is getting per day."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bulsiewicz goes on to share more about the many &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7835832/health-benefits-of-raspberries/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits of raspberries&lt;/a&gt;, including them being rich in nutrients like "vitamin C and polyphenol antioxidants … that are incredibly good for us," he adds. "Believe it or not, even though there's sugar in berries, berries have been shown to reduce our likelihood of developing [type 2] diabetes. And if you have [type 2] diabetes, they can help you to ultimately reverse it."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lastly, Bulsiewicz loves that raspberries are high in fiber and low in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291572/what-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FODMAPs&lt;/a&gt;—fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols. While many of these specific types of carbs are beneficial for people with healthy guts, they have been shown to exacerbate symptoms among those who have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "In other words, if you have digestive issues and are rebuilding your gut, you should be enjoying raspberries," concludes Bulsiewicz. Thankfully, there are many ways you can do just that. The doctor adores raspberry toasts, raspberry salads, raspberry spritzers and raspberry smoothies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating raspberries has several benefits, including &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871141/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-don-t-eat-enough-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adding to your fiber quota&lt;/a&gt;, promoting healthy digestion (even if you struggle with IBS), consuming more vitamins, minerals and polyphenols, and more. But keep in mind that raspberries shouldn't be your only source of fiber. One of the top five things you should do every day to improve your gut and overall health, says Bulsiewicz, is to eat a wide variety of plants, whole grains, healthy fats and protein.&lt;br&gt;

In that time, 7,074 people died – deaths which were then cross-referenced against &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/here-are-all-the-reasons-why-you-should-enjoy-your-cup-of-coffee"&gt;coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee drinkers showed a notably lower risk of all-cause mortality, the researchers found, but when more than a little sugar and saturated fat (as found in full-cream milk or cream) was added to the mix, that statistical significance went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165130" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165130" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk.jpg" alt="Pouring milk into coffee" class="wp-image-165130 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk.jpg 1600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-642x361.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-738x415.jpg 738w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/PouringMilk-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165130" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Adding sugar and fat took away the benefits linked with coffee.

Between two or three cups a day seems to be the sweet spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the researchers did factor in variables that might have affected mortality rates – including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/boosting-exercise-intensity-reduces-mortality-risk-study-suggests"&gt;exercise levels&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol intake, age, sex, and education level – the study isn't thorough enough to prove direct cause and effect. There may still be unknown variables influencing both coffee drinking and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the data here does show a strong association, and does fit in with previous research into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;the health benefits of coffee&lt;/a&gt;. This study suggests that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="165127" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; drives those benefits, as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-coffee-may-not-even-need-caffeine-to-wake-you-up"&gt;decaffeinated coffee&lt;/a&gt; drinkers saw no difference in mortality rates, and that sugar, milk, and cream might dilute the positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds, but our results suggest that the addition of sugar and saturated fat may reduce the mortality benefits," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/06/16/hold-cream-and-sugar-black-coffee-linked-lower-risk-death"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Fang Fang Zhang from Tufts University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's plenty more still to look into here, not least how the many different components of coffee might be protecting against an early death. There are likely to be numerous factors involved – including when you actually drink the stuff, as shown by a study published &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/key-health-perks-of-coffee-depend-on-when-you-drink-it-suggests-study"&gt;at the start of the year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new research is particularly helpful in that it isolates the coffee itself from anything else we may throw into it, which isn't the case for all studies like this – with each study often focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting"&gt;an angle of its own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it's important for us to know what it might mean for health," &lt;a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2025/06/16/hold-cream-and-sugar-black-coffee-linked-lower-risk-death"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tjnut.2025.05.004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

However, overall heart disease death rates over the past five decades dropped by 66% in American adults ages 25 and older, according to a new study. Even better, deaths from heart attacks dropped by nearly 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Over the past 50 years, our understanding of heart disease, what causes it and how we treat it has evolved considerably," said lead study author Dr. Sara King, a second-year internal medicine resident at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been great strides made in helping people survive initial acute cardiac events that were once considered a death sentence," King said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that positive news has a flip side. Deaths from all other types of heart disease, including arrhythmia, heart failure and hypertensive heart disease, increased by 81% in the United States, according to the study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to put both sets of numbers into perspective, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These days, the likelihood of dying from a heart attack is relatively low compared to where it's been, but the likelihood of significant disability from the heart attack is still high," said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You might develop heart failure — where the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's needs and you're always short of breath," he said. "Or maybe you're on a number of medications for blood pressure, fluid retention and cholesterol, or you never feel your best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one thing to be alive; it's another to be alive and well," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cardiovascular risks on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study analyzed government data on deaths from heart disease between 1970 and 2022. Back in 1970, heart attacks were responsible for 54% of all deaths from heart issues. By 2022 that number had dropped to 29%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths from atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias, which happen when electrical impulses to the heart go awry and cause an irregular heartbeat or "flutter" in the chest, were rare in the 1970s. By 2022, the number had risen to 450% — about 4% of all heart disease deaths, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deaths from heart failure increased 146% over the same time period, while death due to persistent high blood pressure rose by 106%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes in cardiovascular risk factors are contributing to the rise in certain types of heart disease, the study said. Obesity, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, poor food choices and physical inactivity have skyrocketed over the past 50 years. Obesity prevalence rose from 15% in 1970 to 40% in 2022, the study found. Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes now impacts nearly half of all adults in the United States. High blood pressure increased from 30% in 1978 to nearly 50% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another potential contributor — the aging baby boomer population now reaching a time when they are most likely to develop heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of these risk factors contribute to an ongoing burden of heart disease, especially as related to heart failure, hypertensive heart disease and arrhythmias," said senior study author Dr. Latha Palaniappan, professor of cardiovascular medicine and associate dean for research at Stanford University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heart disease hasn't gone away," Palaniappan said in a statement. "The focus now must be on helping people age with strong, healthy hearts by preventing events, and prevention can start as early as childhood."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

She glared at me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“What’s it got to do with you?” she asked. “Since you stopped cooking for us, I think I can eat whatever I want.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This isn’t the first time something like this has happened. Ever since I went on the weight-loss drug Mounjaro — and consequently lost my appetite and three stone in weight — I have essentially stopped cooking. My daughter’s alleged fondness for cheese strings is, I suspect, a deliberate act designed to rile me. For now I no longer&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; cook and the three children I live with are decidedly not happy about it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;As they are aged 22, 21 and 18, it’s not that they can’t cook. They’re perfectly capable of cooking for themselves and I very much doubt my daughter is going to eat a cheese string ever. It’s just that they have been brought up on organic this and foraged that. For most of their lives I have banged on about how we are what we eat and the importance of a varied diet and gut health. So much so I think they’d probably come out in an allergic reaction if they ate even a slice of pizza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My daughter is just making a point, and in many ways it’s a valid one. The way weight-loss drugs work is that they affect the hormone in your brain that tells you to eat. And I love eating. But I’ve been on Mounjaro for eight months and it’s not only affected my body and how I feel about it, but also everyone around me, especially my children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I have always been known as someone who likes to cook. It has been something I’ve been incredibly proud of. I didn’t grow up in a particularly food-orientated household. I certainly didn’t cook at university or in my twenties, when I lived on Pot Noodles and soya puddings. But as I grew older and our national interest in food grew, I began to find food and cooking and eating far more interesting and nuanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="4.4"&gt;&lt;div id="125ba036-675f-49b6-83a4-f7af60d15380"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Lucy Cavendish before Mounjaro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GEMMA DAY FOR THE TIMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In my thirties I was the launch editor of Observer Food Monthly and after that my obsession with food and cooking grew and grew. I met so many chefs, from Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett to Marcus Wareing and Rick Stein. I went on many cooking courses at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s cookery school in Dorset. I went out fishing and learnt how to gut and cook mackerel on an open fire. I made pizza dough from scratch. I rolled out pasta. I went to Italy and learnt how to cook focaccia. In Spain I ate boar in a dark bitter chocolate sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Over the years, it’s not just been about the cooking and the food and the taste, it’s been about who I am. So it’s also become part of my children’s lives and part of our identity as a family. We are the family that still had a Sunday roast complete with cauliflower cheese, homemade roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings, the works. Even as my children have got older, I’ve produced risottos and baked monkfish with pancetta. They would come back in from work or studying and there would be a delicious meal ready and waiting. It’s always felt like an offering of love that I have wanted to give them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;That was until I went on Mounjaro and, of course, life changed. It’s very hard to cook for people when you have absolutely no appetite. Every time I look in the fridge, I can’t see a single thing I want to eat. I go to the supermarket, the shops and the farmers’ market, and whereas in the past I was so inspired — buying forest mushrooms and fruit just picked from the trees — I now can’t think of a single thing I want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;I’ll pick up delicious ripe apples and think, hmm … all those lovely fresh fish waiting to be grilled with lemon and butter and salt and pepper? Not one bit of me wants to eat it. I know we need to have food in the fridge but even red pepper hummus, a former favourite, leaves me feeling slightly queasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/mounjaro-weight-loss-injection-nhs-l0g0pg3dc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mounjaro weight-loss injections now available in UK through NHS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Then, given that I have no appetite, I don’t find cooking interesting any more. Food has become completely dull and I have begun to wonder why I’d liked it in the first place. It’s extraordinary. I used to spend all day thinking about what to buy and what to cook and how much everyone would love it and how much I would love it, and now I can’t even get a flatbread down me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If I were living on my own, that would be fine. I would have virtually nothing in my fridge except a bit of smoked salmon and some vegetables and fruit. But I’m still living with three out of my four children and there has always been this coming together as a family to eat delicious food prepared by me — it has always felt very bonding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So they were rather taken aback when it got to the first Sunday of my weight-loss journey and no roast appeared. “Oh, are we having a roast today?” my daughter asked, because she loves a Sunday roast. I told her that I was on my weight-loss injections — I’ve been very honest about that — and that I no longer had any appetite. “But we’ve still got appetites,” she said, looking a little bit hurt. It occurred to me then that if I stopped cooking for them they could make an assumption that I didn’t love them any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“It’s not that I don’t love you or care about you,” I told them. “It’s just that I no longer want to cook any food or buy any food or have anything to do with food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/weight-loss-injections-jabs-pancreatitis-gv7hrssvt" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fears over weight-loss jabs after ten deaths from pancreatitis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;This statement went down like a lead balloon. They looked at me as if I had slapped them across their faces with a fish. “Things are going to have to change,” I said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At first it took a bit of time. There was lots of going to the fridge and staring in it as if food would suddenly appear by magic. I could see my son Leonard’s face fall with disappointment as he would stare at the sad salad wilting in the bottom of the fridge and some ancient soft cheese that was probably going a bit mouldy. My daughter then decided that she would buy some cookbooks and start cooking elaborate meals that essentially involved using every single saucepan and utensil in the kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“If you won’t cook, I will have to cook,” she said, whirling a ladle above her head. When she got tired of that she obviously decided to go down the cheese string route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;My third son, Jerry, decided this was an opportunity for him to go on a protein-based diet so he now bulk-buys endless amounts of cheap chicken breasts and eggs. He seems to exist on nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/shane-watson-mounjaro-l7hk66t5f" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The nine things we’ll miss when we’re all hooked on Mounjaro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Another effect of all this is that everyone eats separately, which is actually a sadness to me. My desire to lose weight and get healthy has had a detrimental effect on our family life. I look better and feel fitter but it’s as if I’ve moved into a completely different world. I’m still not really used to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So we are all trying to get to know each other in a slightly different way. I’m not exactly sure how that will work out. At some point I will be off the weight-loss drugs and maybe I’ll go back to producing nonstop delicious meals. Until then, however, the kitchen is going to stink of eggs and the fridge will be full of cheese strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 22:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxOOUtTR3ZRYnZKVmM4RGI5VXBZYS1CMmtQd2tNRkhZWnhfT0NERE04VElBUFJTV1R5bEJCb1ZtUU8xZG5lMTNYRjNCQ0hZb3lZWk1iODBLajNWUEtCNWcwekF6aXZDZEtSY1hqMmVGS2Rnb2lTRWl0NnRBbmw2aDUtaGNIb3IzcXpOcmNMQXNnMjZzSmVFX3hWV01fWXMxcnJtNFpRSmpHc0NqdzFsZDJoeTFIcmlTakU</guid></item><item><title>医生和护士正在揭示您不应忽视的“小”健康标志，这令人震惊- BuzzFeed | Doctors And Nurses Are Revealing The "Small" Health Signs You Should Never Ignore, And It's Shocking - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPRTlHNVEwRnVac2dpVFVTOGdMTU9qd0RoV2FrbW1iWFM5Q0h1NkU0WW9YVVRacUEwZVAzdlpFZFh6cFllbVJhb09HUUFld3hjUmg1ZDVtdkJfQ3pHQUVSWl9qODdZZFVlMDg2TmNmdVVpQk1pQkJKYndINkZrOFdNWUpjNVgyNUtrWXV3MWhtWHR1Mk4wcVY1eQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"I work in rehab, bracing, and supports for orthopedic surgeons. A huge wake-up call for my own health was seeing normal, successful people in their 40s to 60s who couldn't do more than one push-up or get up from a seated position on the floor, with chronic back pain, neck pain, obesity, and falling. I assumed you magically lose that strength once you're old and retired, but no! It's so important to consistently do some version of moderate cardio and strength training from childhood until past retirement age. Do not skip your 20s to 50s!"&lt;/span&gt;

Plenty of people find themselves taking a power nap to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a65026836/foods-that-give-you-energy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:boost energy and fight fatigue;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;boost energy and fight fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. However, a new study shows that napping earlier in the day, along with other factors, could be connected with a high rate of mortality in certain groups. Though the research has yet to be peer reviewed, the findings are interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the expert: Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/48/Supplement_1/A152/8135607?login=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;followed 86,565 participants across the United Kingdom from the UK Biobank. The ages of the volunteers ranged from 43 to 79 years, with 57% of the study participants identifying as female and 43% identifying as male. Researchers evaluated participants’ daytime napping behaviors to determine a link between daytime naps and the risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What researchers found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers reviewed self-reported daytime napping behavior alongside data collected from participants via activity trackers over seven days. Their daytime sleep habits were logged, tracking nap duration, timing, and any variation from existing nap habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data was cross-referenced against other factors, including chronotype (the time of day you prefer to sleep or when you’re the most alert or have the most energy), BMI (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which is not always an accurate predictor of health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which is not always an accurate predictor of health&lt;/a&gt;), demographics, comorbidities, nighttime sleep habits, smoking, and alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found a strong connection between nap patterns and long-term health risks, including longevity and mortality. Specifically, longer naps, increased individual variability in the lengths of daytime naps, and napping around noon and the early afternoon hours were associated with greater risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight the potential importance of considering napping behaviors in risk stratification of mortality in middle-to-older aged adults,” researchers concluded, noting the value of incorporating nap assessments into clinical and public health practices in promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do certain nap patterns increase the risk of death?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ashley Curtis, Ph.D., assistant professor and director of the Cognition, Aging, Sleep, and Health (CASH) Lab in the College of Nursing at the &lt;a href="https://health.usf.edu/nursing/faculty-staff/directory/ashleycurtis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:University of South Florida;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;University of South Florida &lt;/a&gt;explained that research suggests that shorter daytime naps (under 30 mins) can be associated with some health benefits for older adults, longer naps (60-plus mins) have been linked to increased risk of mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shown in this study, “Greater likelihood of napping around noon appears to have a detrimental impact on mortality risk,” Curtis said. “Further, there is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:emerging research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;emerging research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the variability in napping behavior over time in older adults, such as switching from short to long naps or vice versa, is also associated with increased all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why would napping be associated with death?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why napping may be associated with greater risk of mortality, according to Curtis, who explains that longer daytime napping itself may be a sign of poor nighttime sleep and sleep disorders—such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a44211864/insomnia-linked-to-higher-risk-of-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insomnia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and obstructive &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/sleep-energy/a43933932/sleep-apnea-linked-to-increased-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-stroke-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep apnea;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;—which “are known to be associated with worse health trajectories and increased mortality risk if left untreated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis explains that the fragmented sleep associated with both of these sleep disorders may disrupt circadian factors and affect daytime alertness, thus leading older adults to nap more easily during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also a reciprocal relationship between napping and worse health outcomes and mortality,” she continues, adding that certain nap patterns in older adults have long been associated with the increased chronic low-grade &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/inflammation/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that plays a role in various other medical conditions linked to worse health outcomes and longevity, “such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a64255416/ultra-processed-foods-obesity-brain-changes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a62235177/endocrinologists-guide-to-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, hypertension, and osteoporosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more than just the fact that napping may be an indicator of an increased risk for death, Curtis reiterates, but &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article-abstract/41/7/zsy087/4990845" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:changes in existing nap patterns;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;changes in existing nap patterns&lt;/a&gt; as well. “These metrics, in combination with worse nighttime sleep (such as shorter total sleep time), may predict worse mortality outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can the connection between napping and death be broken?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11357-024-01351-5&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fsleep-energy%2Fa65175910%2Fnegative-health-effects-of-taking-a-nap%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cites research;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;cites research&lt;/a&gt; showing that the mortality risk associated with longer daytime napping in older adults may be lowered by certain lifestyle factors such as physical activity. “That is, specifically meeting the recommended weekly dosage of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity) can weaken the association between napping and mortality risk,” she continues. “Such physical activities for older adults could include fast walking or jogging, dancing, swimming, or hiking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curtis adds that the relationship between napping and mortality may be more nuanced in older adults and depend on sex differences in the prevalence of sleep disorders. “At least &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22951185/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; has shown that in older men, those who slept less than six hours and napped more than 30 minutes during the day had a higher risk of mortality,” she explains, noting that the same pattern wasn’t found in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Curtis says that when compared to older women, older men have higher rates of frequent nighttime urination and obstructive sleep apnea, both of which are linked to greater daytime sleepiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The longer napping and increased mortality relationship findings in older adults are largely consistent. However, the exact mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been fully determined,” Curtis says. “The napping and mortality relationship is complex and may be influenced by adverse or protective lifestyle factors (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, substance use), nighttime sleep patterns, and underlying sleep disorders, medical comorbidities, age, as well as sex and gender-related factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is needed in this area, this study offers hope in identifying some early predictors of increased mortality and new clinical approaches for promoting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 19:28:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBsNGEyOFRETk9uYU5XaFNKMTZ4T1NRdGY1ZDhSRVFldDJ2QUMtY1p4aFF3ZjZSZjBGbmVrZzVSYkdmN0JGemx6d0lVRENyWldDeHNmdm93OGhweDRCMndLYlY4UkJfUlBmaVNnR2h5RDZhTzVOMFNEbTN6TEIwUQ</guid></item><item><title>据EatingWell专家介绍，下午5点后应避免4件事，以降低中风风险 | 4 Things to Avoid After 5 P.M. to Reduce Stroke Risk, According to Experts - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxOaGRDd3pXb3FOVDA5TTU4cldCN3hGcUZRNjh5SlFES0pQdWFQbHhCUENXRmNCRjBJTi1ndXNlUjR4VkFyNEo5aDJfVE5XNGw4TkZCQmhqZl9IU0xUYldnbUY0anVfWWtjdUk5SVBFMlAteDhlUDFSRlNUSy1lZ3BkNWlfanJrRDNKd0FSRA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stroke is a leading cause of death, but small, consistent habits can reduce your risk. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s easy to focus on what to do by day, but experts say our nighttime habits matter, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They suggest moving more, getting enough sleep and avoiding late meals and alcohol.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stroke is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it’s on the rise.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, you may be wondering how you can reduce your odds. Part of the answer may lie in your nighttime habits. “It’s the small, consistent habits we do every day that can have a significant impact on reducing our risk of multiple chronic diseases, including heart disease and stroke,” says &lt;a href="https://www.coachsimranmd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Simran Malhotra, M.D., DipABLM, CHWC&lt;/a&gt;. “Modifiable risk factors of stroke are things that are in our control, like eating a whole food fiber-rich diet, regular movement, restorative sleep and limiting risky substances like tobacco and alcohol.”  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, research shows that up to 84% of strokes are linked to modifiable lifestyle factors.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Some of that means focusing on your 9-to-5. Yet what you do–and don’t do–after hours can also have a lasting impact on your odds. To help you make the most of those evening hours, we reached out to cardiovascular health experts. Here are the key nighttime habits they recommend avoiding to cut your risk of having a stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-eating-a-late-dinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Eating a Late Dinner  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating late at night might feel like a normal part of your routine, especially if the day gets away from you. But it could be putting your brain and heart health at risk. “Late meals may disrupt your body’s circadian rhythm and negatively affect blood pressure and metabolism, says &lt;a href="http://www.entirelynourished.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein, M.S., RD CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a dietitian who specializes in cardiovascular health. Over time, these disruptions may increase your risk of cardiovascular issues, including stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has found that eating your last meal of the day after 9 P.M. is associated with a higher stroke risk compared to eating dinner earlier. A similar increased risk is linked to eating a late breakfast, suggesting that the timing of both your first and last meals may play a bigger role in stroke risk than previously believed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Making a habit of eating earlier, both in the morning and at night, could support your body’s natural rhythms and protect against stroke. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-lounging-on-the-couch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Lounging on the Couch &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After dinner, it can be tempting to park yourself on the couch to relax for the evening, especially after a long day. While rest is important, spending too much time lounging around at night could increase your risk of stroke, particularly if you already sit for long periods during the day. Even if you’re young. For instance, one large&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;study found that physically inactive people under 60 who spent more than eight hours a day watching TV, using the computer or reading were three and a half times more likely to experience a stroke than people who spent less free time in sedentary activities.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is even small amounts of activity can be beneficial. “Taking a 20-minute post-dinner walk can help with digestion while optimizing blood sugar control,” says Malhotra. “This can help with reducing the risk of prediabetes, diabetes, high blood pressure and ultimately heart disease and stroke.” If you’re walking to lower your risk of stroke, picking up the pace can help even more. According to one meta-analysis, every 0.66-mile-per-hour increase in a person’s walking speed was linked to a 13% reduction in stroke risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-sipping-a-nightcap"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Sipping a Nightcap &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your evening wind-down routine includes a glass or two of wine, beer or bourbon, you may be setting the stage for stroke without realizing it. While past research suggests drinking may provide some protection against stroke, more recent evidence challenges that idea. “Alcohol increases inflammation and damages cells,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/troy-alexander-el-md-8b6381152/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Troy Alexander-EL, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; For instance, one of the largest international studies on stroke risk found that moderate and high alcohol intake were linked to a greater risk of stroke. Even downing five or more drinks per day just once a month raised a person's risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Given the entirety of the evidence, swapping your routine nightcap with an herbal tea or mocktail could be a simple way to reduce your odds. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-staying-up-too-late"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Staying Up Too Late &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re burning the midnight oil watching TV, scrolling on your phone or catching up on work, you may be doing more harm than good. “Sleep is the foundational longevity pillar and the most underrated lifestyle habit,” says Malhotra. Research has found both too much or too little sleep can up your risk of stroke. However, sleeping too much may be even more detrimental than not sleeping enough. The proof? One meta-analysis found that people who slept five or fewer hours per night were 33% more likely to experience a stroke. However, those odds rose to 71% in people who slept eight or more hours nightly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Since both too little and too much sleep are problematic, getting those nightly eight hours is a good goal. Keeping consistent bed and wake-up times, even on weekends can also be helpful, says Malhotra.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Stroke is a leading cause of death, and its numbers are on the rise. While some risk factors, like age and family history, are out of your control, your health habits can go a long way in reducing your odds. Of course, it’s easy to focus on what we do during the day. But what you do–and don’t do–after 5 P.M. can have a surprising impact on your chances of having a stroke, say cardiovascular health experts. To reduce your risk, they recommend skipping that nightcap, spending less time on the couch, avoiding late meals and turning in early. These simple evening choices may sound small, but they can add up to big benefits for your heart and brain health.&lt;br&gt;

A Spanish trial that followed 57,000 adults for a decade now shows that a laboratory stool test performs as well as a full colonoscopy at detecting early disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding supports the view that a quick fecal immunochemical test (&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000704.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FIT&lt;/a&gt;) done at home can stand shoulder‑to‑shoulder with the hospital scope when the goal is catching cancer early. The result has lit up social media feeds and could change how doctors explain screening choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study leaders Dr. Antoni Castells of &lt;a href="https://www.clinicbarcelona.org/en/professionals/antoni-castells" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hospital Clínic de Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.enriquequintero.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Enrique Quintero&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www3.gobiernodecanarias.org/sanidad/scs/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; of the Canary Islands coordinated the decade‑long &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00619-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Colonprev project&lt;/a&gt;, the first randomized comparison of these two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both physicians are veteran gastroenterologists who have spent years urging wider participation in national screening programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their team worked with 15 tertiary hospitals across eight Spanish regions, randomly inviting half the participants to a one‑time colonoscopy and the other half to biennial FIT kits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Careful follow‑up over ten years allowed the researchers to record every &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/y-chromosome-disappearance-study-finds-direct-link-to-much-greater-cancer-risk/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; diagnosis and related death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colon-cancer-cases-are-rising"&gt;Colon cancer cases are rising&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, doctors expect roughly 107,320 new &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/protein-cd74-discovery-may-change-the-treatment-of-colon-cancer/"&gt;colon cancers&lt;/a&gt; and 46,950 rectal cancers in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers place the disease third among all cancers for incidence and keep it high on the public‑health agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall incidence has fallen about one percent per year in adults over 50 thanks to better screening and lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, rates in adults younger than fifty have climbed 2.4 percent annually, highlighting why simple tests that people actually use matter so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortality also remains substantial, with an estimated 52,900 U.S. deaths forecast for 2025, even as older age groups benefit from earlier detection and improved treatment. Every saved life therefore counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Colonprev investigators recorded 55 colorectal‑&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plant-virus-that-attacks-black-eyed-peas-also-kills-cancer-tumors/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; deaths in the colonoscopy group and 60 in the FIT group, a difference of just 0.02 percentage points that met their strict non‑inferiority margin of 0.16. Clinically, that means both strategies protect patients equally well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the stool test achieved this outcome while requiring no bowel prep, sedation, or time off work. Non‑inferiority therefore arrived with far less disruption to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participation in screening was higher among individuals invited to faecal immunochemical test screening than colonoscopy screening,” wrote Dr. Castells. His comment captures why uptake metrics deserve as much attention as raw test accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-colonoscopy-screening-is-less-popular"&gt;Colonoscopy screening is less popular&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better participation amplifies the impact of any screening program, because an excellent test is useless if few people complete it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health planners often describe this benefit as the difference between efficacy (how well something works in theory) and effectiveness (how well it works in the real world).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier interim &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22356323/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt;, published in 2012, hinted at the same pattern: screening participation was better with FIT while colonoscopy found more benign adenomas without improving &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bats-dont-get-cancer-now-scientists-think-they-know-the-reason/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; mortality at that time. The full ten‑year data confirm that early signal and settle the mortality question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Spanish trial, 39.9 percent of those invited mailed back FIT kits compared with 31.8 percent who scheduled colonoscopies. Similar gaps appear in U.S. insurance &lt;a href="https://ascopost.com/news/october-2022/study-examines-efficacy-cost-of-fit-vs-multitarget-stool-dna-testing-for-colorectal-cancer-screening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare figures place the average price of an at‑home FIT around $24, whereas a colonoscopy with facility fees often reaches $635 or more. That sticker difference alone can sway both patients and payers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond dollars, convenience matters; the scope requires a clear liquid diet, a potent laxative, transportation, and recovery time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stool card, by contrast, takes minutes in the privacy of one’s bathroom and slips into a prepaid envelope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, colonoscopy offers an immediate therapeutic edge because doctors can remove suspicious polyps during the same session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive FIT therefore triggers a follow‑up colonoscopy to finish the job, making both tests partners rather than rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4949-colonoscopy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; notes that minor side effects like temporary bloating are common, while serious complications such as bleeding or a tear in the bowel wall are rare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing these risks helps people weigh the comfort of FIT against the one‑and‑done nature of colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-you"&gt;What this means for you&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force&lt;/a&gt; advises starting regular screening at age forty‑five and continuing through seventy‑five, with the choice of yearly FIT, colonoscopy every ten years, or several other approved options. Older adults up to eighty‑five may also benefit, depending on overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking a test that fits your lifestyle greatly increases the odds you will stick with the schedule. Many clinics now mail FIT kits directly after a routine visit, and some pharmacies hand them out without an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your clinician how family history, inflammatory bowel disease, or certain genetic syndromes might alter timing or frequency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a plan is in place, set a reminder, complete the test on time, and encourage friends and relatives to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons (&lt;a href="https://fascrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ASCRS&lt;/a&gt;) lists fiber‑rich foods, regular exercise, limited red meat, and quitting tobacco among six clear steps that cut risk. Screening finds problems early, and healthy choices lower the odds those problems ever appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, do not ignore new digestive symptoms between screenings, because even the best schedule cannot replace prompt care when something feels off. Warning signs like rectal bleeding or unexplained weight loss deserve swift attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40158525/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 18:54:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNaXp6YmoyNDZUb21PVXk1MDV0WDFiWGtNTlQwNUZvWE5scnFyeUtqQ2lva05QYTBsVlNsWE5YdS1DeU9uWmk0djlMSzhuY0lQX3RRNk5VcnFuUGEtNTlFa2U3eTJBa0hXU196SWhBaTJyNFBIazhIVnV0ZllRSzJwdVNvSzJ5SDI0VzdFQnAtVjh2MG5JRmw4a2poaVFXQllmMXpieXdWNEJiUEd6</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，您不应该服用预防癌症的5种补充剂- EatingWell | 5 Supplements You Shouldn’t Take to Prevent Cancer, According to a Dietitian - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE15NE9iWHRmbVdZZTIwdjYwa1h3QlZqVHMzXzRaZldFaTZRa1JJa3FQVmhpYXptUEFPbkdmc21uajUzV0I1MUFJd2JzZ0g4MVNxN3FBZ1JlM01TQWlyeFJZYlBsTTF4OWs0dE1WSXp2N2lVZFp4bjBPd1h6bF9yYTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietary supplements shouldn’t be taken to reduce your cancer risk—some may actually increase your risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts encourage getting nutrients from food like fruit, veggies and whole grains instead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consider lifestyle changes like limiting alcohol and getting regular exercise to lower your cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If there’s one thing you can take away after reading this article, it’s this: Supplements do not prevent cancer. That’s the stance of the World Cancer Research Fund, which encourages people to get their nutrients from food, not supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Overwhelmingly, studies on supplements rarely pan out,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/patient-family/support-services/nutrition/team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hillary Wright, M.Ed., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a senior oncology dietitian at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. In specific situations, supplements may be useful for filling personal gaps &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-an-oncologist-has-for-breakfast-11722729" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;in one’s diet&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re not useful when it comes to preventing cancer in the future, says Wright. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, the pull to pop is understandable. “It can be easier to take a pill than think about how to incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet,” says Wright. Let’s address five supplements that have been suggested to help prevent cancer and what you should do instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-beta-carotene"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Beta Carotene &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beta carotene is an antioxidant plant pigment that’s part of the carotenoid family.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Antioxidants are substances that neutralize cell-damaging free radicals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) Your body converts &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-a-than-carrot-11690733" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;beta carotene into vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be found in produce like carrots, dark leafy vegetables, sweet potatoes and cantaloupe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The interest in beta carotene came from the observation that people who eat more fruits and vegetables seem to get less lung cancer. However, beta carotene is one singular component of countless compounds that someone’s body is exposed to if they eat more fruits and vegetables,” Wright explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When research was done on beta carotene supplements, scientists learned that people who smoke and take beta carotene get more lung cancer, and the research had to be terminated, she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Wright adds, “From a nutritionist standpoint, it’s not surprising that when we cherry-pick a particular nutrient and take it in high doses that don’t occur in nature, there may be unintended consequences.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-vitamin-c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is another antioxidant vitamin that has had a long history of being linked to immune system support. “There’s been an interest in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; ‘boosting’ the immune system for decades. I haven’t read any science that backs that up across the board,” says Wright. “There is a lack of evidence suggesting that we should take daily supplemental vitamin C.” (It’s a water-soluble vitamin, so you typically urinate the excess, and there’s less of a safety risk compared to other supplements like beta carotene.&lt;a href="https://www.wcrf.org/research-policy/evidence-for-our-recommendations/supplements/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) That said, eating foods high in vitamin C is a good idea—and in fact, a C-rich diet has been associated with a lower incidence of several cancers, including breast, cervical, endometrial, esophageal, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-vitamin-e"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Vitamin E &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like beta carotene, taking vitamin E may cause more problems than it solves. It’s an antioxidant, which is why vitamin E supplements have been linked to cancer prevention. Although there have been studies done on the effects of vitamin E supplements on some cancers, the results have been mixed. Disappointingly, there is not enough evidence that taking vitamin E will help you prevent cancer, and it can increase your risk of certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer, when consumed in large doses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D is considered a hormone that improves calcium absorption in the gut and affects bone formation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; We get&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; from the food we eat (such as dairy), and our skin produces the vitamin in response to sun exposure. There is no doubt that adequate vitamin D is incredibly important for overall health. “We have vitamin D receptors in almost every cell in our body—but this doesn’t mean that people need to be super vitamin D’d,” says Wright. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to cancer, while there is evidence that D may inhibit the growth of cancer cells in animal models, there is no data to suggest that this decreases the risk of cancer in humans.&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11430526/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; If you suspect your levels of D are inadequate (a frequent occurrence in the winter months for those in more northern climates), talk to your health care provider about being tested for vitamin D and if a supplement is right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-calcium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Calcium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Calcium is a key nutrient for bone health, muscle and nerve function, and blood clotting.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In some instances, your health care provider may recommend supplemental doses if you are at risk for calcium deficiency due to your health or diet. However, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excess intake of calcium&lt;/a&gt;—more than 1,000 milligrams from supplements daily—is associated with a 53% increased risk of cancer mortality, research has found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Calcium from food was found to be safe.) It’s not yet clear why excess supplemental calcium may have this detrimental impact, but the amount of calcium absorbed by the body may differ when it comes from food versus supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-strategies-to-reduce-cancer-risk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Strategies to Reduce Cancer Risk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cancer prevention isn’t found in a pill. “Overwhelmingly, diet and lifestyle strategies show the most promise for reducing cancer risk and supporting survivorship,” says Wright. According to the WCRF, 40% of cancer cases are preventable.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The following is an evidence-backed list of five of the WCRF’s recommendations to prevent cancer:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintain a healthy weight: &lt;/strong&gt;Overweight and obesity can lead to chronic inflammation and higher than normal levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones, which may lead to cancer. The more weight a person carries and the longer they do, the greater the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be physically active: &lt;/strong&gt;Getting regular exercise can help manage your weight. Adults should aim for 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans: &lt;/strong&gt;Vegetables (including beans) and fruits contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and other plant compounds that may help prevent cancer. These foods, in addition to whole grains, may also reduce the risk of cancer by supporting a healthy weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit fast foods, red and processed meats and sugar-sweetened drinks: &lt;/strong&gt;The science is clear on the connection between increased cancer risk (especially colorectal cancer) and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/processed-meats-and-cancer-11728821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eating red and processed meats&lt;/a&gt;. Red and processed meat may also play a role in increasing the risk of breast cancer and some forms of prostate cancer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol and don’t smoke:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking can increase your risk for certain types of cancer, like throat, colon, rectum, breast and liver. Stay within the guidelines for alcohol (two drinks per day for men and one drink per day for women). Smoking is responsible for 9 out of 10 lung cancer deaths, but it also raises your risk for many cancers, including bladder, blood, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-colon-cancer-risk-11694207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and stomach cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary supplements should not be taken to reduce your cancer risk. While many are probably completely ineffective (creating only expensive urine), some supplements have been shown to paradoxically &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; your risk of cancer. That includes high intakes of antioxidant supplements, most notably beta carotene. Consuming nutrients through a healthy, balanced diet is safe and healthy. Plus, a diet that focuses on plant-based foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes has been shown to be protective against cancers. If you need to take a supplement due to a health condition or dietary need, follow your health care provider’s recommendations.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ozempic-like drugs used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity may also treat migraine, even when the medications don't trigger weight loss, early research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A preliminary report, published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.14991" target="_blank" data-url="https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/head.14991" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Headache&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and presented June 21 at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) conference, suggests that liraglutide — a drug used to treat obesity and diabetes — slashed the number of days patients experienced severe migraines by almost half. Liraglutide belongs to a class of drugs called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GLP-1 agonists&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes semaglutide, the active ingredient in the diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the idea of treating migraines with these drugs is "extremely innovative and forward-thinking," the new results should be taken with caution. That's because the trial was small and didn't include a comparison group that didn't use the medication, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/metabolism-systems/sinclair-alexandra" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/metabolism-systems/sinclair-alexandra" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Alex Sinclair&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at the University of Birmingham in the U.K. who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an absolutely tantalizing research study because it gives us a really interesting idea of a new mechanism of delivering drugs for migraine," Sinclair told Live Science. "But it is very preliminary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This "very important and exciting finding" could potentially provide "another treatment option for patients with chronic migraine, especially for those who did not previously respond to other current available treatments," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chiang-chia-chun-m-d/bio-20146997" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chiang-chia-chun-m-d/bio-20146997" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Chia-Chun Chiang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="migraine-days-cut-in-half-3"&gt;Migraine days cut in half &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the effect of liraglutide on migraine, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vjneurology.com/video/q21ihlx0-u0-a-pilot-prospective-observational-study-exploring-glp-1r-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-migraine/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.vjneurology.com/video/q21ihlx0-u0-a-pilot-prospective-observational-study-exploring-glp-1r-agonists-in-the-treatment-of-migraine/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Simone Braca&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy, and colleagues gave 31 patients with obesity and high-frequency or chronic migraine 0.6 milligrams of liraglutide daily for one week, followed by 1.2 mg daily for the next 11 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, nearly half of the patients reported that their number of headache days per month had dropped, from an average of 20 to nine. This was a "huge" effect, Braca told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven people saw their headache days drop by 75%, and one patient's migraines disappeared completely. Overall, the patients also reported a large drop in how much migraine impeded their daily lives. Importantly, the participants did not shed weight during the study. This suggests the improvement in migraine wasn't linked to weight loss, a noteworthy observation since obesity is known to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/migraine-obesity/" target="_blank" data-url="https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/migraine-obesity/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the risk of severe headaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/can-weight-loss-drugs-help-you-drink-less-alcohol" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alcohol/can-weight-loss-drugs-help-you-drink-less-alcohol"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can weight loss drugs help you drink less alcohol?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braca highlighted that these patients had been selected because they had not responded to other migraine drugs, such as antibodies that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a molecule released in the brain during a migraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors have some theories about what might be happening, but they didn't collect measurements that could prove a mechanism of action. GLP-1 drugs may reduce pressure inside the skull by lowering the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain and spinal cord, the researchers suggested. This, in turn, could reduce the release of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30835001/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30835001/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CGRP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which many scientists think fuels migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In support of that hypothesis, Braca's team pointed to a previous study led by Sinclair and published in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151178/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151178/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. It suggested that exenatide, another GLP-1 drug, lowers brain pressure. Of note the drug seemed to reduce migraine days among the study participants, although it was unable to show a strong statistical difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other possible mechanisms underpinning the effect in the new study results could be that liraglutide directly reduced the release of CGRP or that the drug regulated glucose metabolism, Chiang said. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/247255" target="_blank" data-url="https://orbi.uliege.be/handle/2268/247255" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Previous research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that migraine could be linked to issues in glucose metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study has important limitations, though, Sinclair said. First, the study was very small, with only 31 participants, and it lasted only 12 weeks. Another significant limitation is that the trial did not include a placebo group. The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/32941-is-the-placebo-effect-real.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;placebo effect&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, by which people's symptoms improve even with a sham treatment, is particularly strong when it comes to self-reported pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a big placebo response in headache research," Sinclair told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braca agreed that the trial had limitations. Still, "both the history of multiple previous treatment failures and the magnitude of the observed response reduce the likelihood of a significant placebo effect," Braca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results now need to be confirmed in larger, placebo-controlled clinical trials before they could guide treatment for patients with migraine. If confirmed, however, the findings could open up a new line of inquiry for migraine treatment, Braca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn-nOdiYlBY8fkJj3c93CLCelCIOX1whNtp" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-asHdHR9rt82HiQYG74JVAn-nOdiYlBY8fkJj3c93CLCelCIOX1whNtp slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Health professionals have long used body mass index as a quick screening tool to fast-track certain patients into a "code red" management plan — people whose weight puts them in danger of future health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is that BMI measures health risk by calculating height and weight. However, muscle and bone weigh more than fat, so BMI measurements can overestimate the danger for people with a muscular build or a larger frame. Conversely, BMI can underestimate health concerns in older adults and anyone who has lost muscle, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, authors of a new study say a different approach to weight measurement may be a more accurate way to predict future health issues. Bioelectrical impedance analysis, or BIA, uses undetectable electric currents to measure not only the percentage of body fat but also lean muscle mass and water weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology works like this: You stand on metal plates on the machine while holding your hands or thumbs on another metal attachment held away from the body. Once started, the machine sends a weak electrical current through the body. Body fat, muscle and bone all have different electrical conductivity, so the machine uses algorithms to determine lean muscle mass, body fat percentage and water weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found body-fat percentage to be a stronger predictor of 15-year mortality risk in adults between the ages of 20 and 49 than BMI," said Arch Mainous III, lead author of the study published Tuesday in the journal Annals of Family Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to deaths from heart disease, people with high body fat as measured by BIA were 262% times more likely to die than people who had a healthy percentage of body fat, said Mainous, a professor and vice chair of research in community health and family medicine at the University of Florida School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now remember, using BMI did not flag any risk at all in this younger population, which isn't one we typically consider to be at high risk for heart disease," said senior author Dr. Frank Orlando, a clinical associate professor of community health and family medicine at University of Florida Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think of the interventions we can do to keep them healthy when we know this early. I think it's a game-changer for how we should look at body composition," Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The problem with BMI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMI is measured by dividing your weight by the square of your height. (If you are mathematically challenged like I am, the National Institutes of Health has a free calculator.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In BMI world, a body mass between 18.5 and 24.9 is a healthy weight, between 25 and 29.9 is overweight, between 30 and 34.9 is obese, between 35 and 39.9 is class 2 obesity, and anything greater than 40 is "severe" or class 3 obesity. People are considered underweight if their BMI is lower than 18.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using BMI to measure health risk works — on a population level. Countless studies have shown that a greater BMI really does correlate with developing chronic diseases of all kinds — cancer, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, kidney and liver disease, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where BMI fails is at the patient level. Imagine a patient who is "skinny fat" — thin on the outside but riddled with globs of fat wrapped around major organs on the inside. Your BMI would be fine even though your health was at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Those people are more likely to have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, more likely to have elevated glucose, more likely to have elevated blood pressure, and more likely to have inflammation in general," Mainous said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these health issues can be treated, stopped and in some cases even reversed if caught early enough, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I think it's a game-changer for how we should look at body composition.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Frank Orlando, clinical associate professor at University of Florida Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doctors are aware of the issues with BMI, many prefer it "because it is cheap and easily put into practice," Mainous said. "They'd like to use a more direct measurement such as a DEXA scan, but those cost too much and are not widely available, so everyone falls back to the indirect measure of BMI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEXA stands for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and is the gold standard for body mass analysis. Such machines can cost between $45,000 and $80,000, so patients typically travel to a hospital or specialty center to get the scan, Orlando said. The cost to the patient can easily be $400 to $500 per scan, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, we found the newer versions of bioelectrical impedance are pretty accurate, giving some valid and reliable results," Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One note — at-home based bioelectrical impedance products are not nearly as accurate, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can be affected a lot by how much body fluid you have, how hydrated you are," said Freeman, who was not involved with the new research. "At-home measurements will only give a ballpark — the clinic-based machines are more precise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it time for doctors to embrace body fat measurements?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study analyzed data on 4,252 men and women who participated in the 1999 to 2004 federal survey called NHANES, or the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a yearly checkup of the nation's health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technicians measured each person's body composition, including height, weight and waist circumference. In addition, all participants underwent a clinic-based bioelectrical impedance analysis, which measures the body's resistance to electrical currents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers then compared that data with the National Death Index through 2019 to see how many people died. After adjusting for age, race and poverty status, the study found a BMI that labeled someone as obese was not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of death from any cause, when compared with those in healthy BMI range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with high body fat as measured by bioimpedance analysis, however, were 78% more likely to die from any cause, Mainous said. Measuring waist circumference was also helpful, but not as accurate as body mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add that to the 262% higher chance of dying from heart disease found by the study, and it's a no-brainer for doctors to use bioelectrical impedance analysis on patients, Orlando said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There have been studies discussing the effects of caffeine on sleep and for me as someone who &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; drink coffee, it’s all about the timing of when the caffeine gets into your system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people can get jitters and hyperactivity after just one sip, but for others, like myself, that doesn’t happen. The half-life of coffee is five to six hours so it’s important to be aware of when you’re drinking it, the effects it can have and how long these effects last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we should stop drinking coffee by 2pm to really allow most of that caffeine to get out of your system by the time you go to bed at 11pm. Drinking coffee late in the afternoon can delay sleepiness or can disrupt sleep and make you more restless. How sensitive you are to caffeine varies between people, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;6pm: start winding down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to make sure I have time to wind down during the evening and allow my mind and body to step away and focus on something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, that’s doing some meditation, breath work, an evening walk, listening to a podcast or watching something on TV. It is better to watch something on a TV, rather than a laptop or phone because the screen’s further away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;7pm: dinner time (and be mindful of lighting)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I eat quite healthily and aim to have a plateful of mostly pulses and vegetables. After dinner I try not to turn on the lights. It’s easier right now because it’s summer, but still in the winter I prefer to keep the lights dim to minimise any alerting signal so I’m ready for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In winter, I think we need to be mindful of electric lighting as a primary source. Be mindful of how bright that light is in the evening and then consider a sunlight alarm clock to wake yourself up in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to engage in non-stimulating activity to allow the mind and brain time to process. If I work right until I go to bed, my mind would be full and it would be hard to sleep because my mind would be full of what I just experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;10pm: read in bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll get into bed and read for about 10 minutes, and turn the light off at 10.15pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can’t fall asleep I reflect on why that might be – is my mind busy? Are my thoughts just going round and round? I try to shift my attention to my breath if I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve worked with a lot of women in midlife to improve their sleep and the one thing they struggle with most is waking up in the middle of the night. Hormonal fluctuations, hot flushes and worry can all play a part in disrupted sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worry is a big one – this might be about falling back asleep, the lack of sleep or performance. All of this can have a negative impact on the quality of sleep we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wake up in the middle of the night, the first thing I do is ask myself what’s going on. Am I too hot? Has a thought grabbed my attention? Is this thought going to be helpful to me right now at three in the morning? Is there anything I can do about this thought right now? In most instances, I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I definitely have days where I don’t sleep well and feel tired the next day. If I have three big glasses of wine, I’ll often wake up in the night and struggle to get back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, it’s important to give yourself grace after a poor night’s sleep. Remind yourself why your sleep might have been affected the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can say to yourself, yes, I was at an occasion and I had more alcohol than usual – it’s not what I usually do, but tonight I’ll go to bed a bit earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As told to Nicole Collins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr Katharina Lederle appears on QVC as the sleep expert for their show, Menopause Your Way and offers one to one client work on her website &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://drkatsleep.com/"&gt;Dr Kat Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Exercise modulates inflammatory pathways, reducing markers like CRP and IL-6.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuroprotection:&lt;/strong&gt; “Physical activity increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), supporting neuronal health and cognitive function, essential for reducing dementia risk and maintaining mental acuity,” Patel says. Translation: it’s good for your brain, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can exercise ever be harmful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve all finished a run and felt like an eighty-year-old whose knees and lungs are crumbling. Is that still an indicator of health? There’s a joke among some athletes—particularly climbers—that your chosen sport advances you ahead of other people. Not in fitness, but in age, with wrists, backs, ankles, elbows all feeling the strain of repetitive movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a paradox,” says Patel. “Exercise itself triggers inflammation, and chronic inflammation is a fast-track to aging.” The key is to find the Goldilocks spot—the just-right amount that stimulates adaptation without excessive wear and tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is meant to cause some muscle damage. It’s how we get stronger, and inflammation is the process by which the damaged areas are sent all of the building materials they need to repair themselves and are protected while this happens. But you’ve probably heard that inflammation is bad, leading to all sorts of worrying things, including cancer. So what’s the solution?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How do you know if you’re hitting the Goldilocks zone?” asks Patel. There are a few ways. You can get a kit to track your biological age, and dial back your workouts if the results are concerning. You can also track heart rate variability, with low HRV indicating poor recovery. &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/vo2-max-1"&gt;Tracking your VO2 Max&lt;/a&gt;—a test of the maximum amount of oxygen your body can use during exercise—works in the same way. Patel calls it “the ultimate predictor of longevity, indicating cardiorespiratory fitness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your levels in any of these tests are higher than you’d like, scale it back. For best results, you might work with a physiologist to find out what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whittaker has a final hack: sleep. “It’s the most important recovery tool by a country mile,” he says, above and beyond cold plunges, red light therapy, Theraguns and all the other trendy gadgets and hacks. Feeling sore? Sometimes, a good night’s rest is all you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I become more active in daily life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting the gym or the running track a few times a week is great, and will have huge benefits for your well-being and chances of living a long life. But moving more isn’t just about doing so in siloed time slots. You’ll also want to move more throughout the day. Koch has some recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit time being sedentary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Consider using a standing desk or exercise ball to replace your chair and regular ‘movement snacks’ to reduce the long hours sitting at a desk everyday,” Koch suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>GQ</author><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 16:55:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTFBsQmxHaGIyak9Cdm5wV29fYUdNQ1AxdzFlVEZDU1p5dGZObWxIdXZ0YW8xNHVjT3Zwa1dwUW02Z0doY2lwUUhyaXc4RWZPM1BDUmZJZnctMV91cm0wZ19J</guid></item><item><title>当我性高潮时，会发生一些非常奇怪的事情。让它停下来。- Slate Magazine | Something Really Strange Happens When I Orgasm.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hugs001i3b76xyr0opqa@published"&gt;I’m a guy. When I masturbate, and I start to orgasm, suddenly my brain kicks into high gear. I start to think about the quality of the orgasm, reconstructing what I did to make it great or not great, and wondering why I’m thinking about these things. Then I start to think about a problem at work I need to solve, what I’m doing for the weekend, and so on, even while I’m still feeling it. Why does this happen? Does some chemical get released in my brain that supercharges my logical side?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hupq001l3b76ja8kn2sn@published"&gt;Straight up, I cannot tell you for sure what this is. It isn’t widely reported enough to be able to say for certain (and if it were, you probably wouldn’t even have to ask). I will offer a potential explanation below that could lead to action on your part in terms of curbing this, though you should determine for yourself whether or not this is something you want to change. From your description, it doesn’t seem to disturb you too much, so the rest of this question may amount to much ado about nothing. Sometimes our thoughts race, no big deal! But if you’re interested in potentially not going through the post-orgasm, high-gear brain, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7husj001m3b76orwn1bz9@published"&gt;One group that does report a similar-sounding phenomenon is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/qu1m05/does_anyone_else_experience_intrusive_thoughts/"&gt;people with OCD&lt;/a&gt;. Do you think it’s fair to call these thoughts “intrusive?” They certainly seem unwelcome and some (particularly those regarding the orgasm you’re having) may qualify as obsessive. Perhaps you have noticed other times in your life when similar thinking manifests, but even if not, it could be somehow related to OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7huxh001n3b762zynrifq@published"&gt;OCD is “one of the most misdiagnosed disorders,” according to psychologist Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.monnicawilliams.com/about.php"&gt;Monnica Williams&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Obsessions-Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder-Step/dp/0190624795"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Step-by-Step, Definitive Guide to Understanding, Diagnosis, and Treatment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “People with OCD can get stuck on anything,” Williams told me when I reached her by phone to discuss your question. “It’s not just germs, not just lining up things on your desk.” The diffuse array of OCD’s presentations can be challenging to clinicians. “We know from research that we’ve done surveying psychologists and counselors that unless it shows up in these very stereotypical ways, it’s often missed,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="179" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hv0v001o3b76h46sc7ec@published"&gt;Williams said that what you describe &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be OCD, but again, this is not a diagnosis—it’s a suggestion for future inquiry on your part, should you be interested in taking it up. Williams said that people with OCD generally “tend to focus on things that are most important to them or central to their identity.” If sex is particularly important to a person, “it could certainly happen that the OCD would tend to strike in that area,” said Williams. Certain events can be more triggering than others, so if you’re only experiencing the intrusive thoughts during orgasm, it could still be a sign of OCD. And, if what’s happening is OCD-related, your brain during these moments could indeed qualify as “supercharged,” “in that you can look at a person’s brain with a PET scan and you can see the increased activity in some of the circuits that are responsible for OCD,” explained Williams. “The brain is in overdrive when a person has OCD. But, I don’t know if I would necessarily correlate that with logic per se,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hv5q001p3b76nh63csy6@published"&gt;Identifying whether this is OCD or not is important because if it is, there are clinical methods to treat it—namely exposure and ritual prevention, according to Williams. In the event that Williams had a patient who reported what you did, she would suggest the following treatment: “What I might do is say, ‘OK, when you masturbate afterwards, instead of thinking about the quality of the orgasm, you’re gonna say to yourself: That orgasm was shit—oh, well. And move on. And in that way, you’re doing kind of the opposite of what your pattern had been. And that’s how you break the cycle.” Mindfulness can help facilitate this, as it can help you gain awareness of your thoughts and your ability to change course. Even if you don’t pursue OCD treatment, I suggest you start practicing mindfulness (see &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/wife-secret-sex-toy-advice-tracking.html"&gt;this past column&lt;/a&gt; for some general background). It may make intervening more easy when your mind starts racing.&lt;/p&gt;

Williams is the director of the &lt;a href="https://www.ocdtypes.com/"&gt;New England OCD Institute&lt;/a&gt;, which may be worth checking out as well—the website offers a self-test that you may find useful.&lt;/p&gt;

I know women get fisted, but let’s face it—vaginas can handle babies. The backdoor wasn’t built for that. Is what my boyfriend wants to do safe or possible for a gay couple?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="42" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hvpp001v3b76pjrv9azf@published"&gt;Yes, Virginia, there are men who get fisted. For some, this is a special occasional treat and for others, it’s a Tuesday night. The gay community contains multitudes and a dude with a hand up his ass is never too far away.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="100" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hvsr001w3b76mrfay2wb@published"&gt;Is fisting safe? It can be if done properly, but it comes with risks in both the long and short term. For a &lt;a href="http://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/boyfriend-pushing-it-advice.html"&gt;previous column&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist Carlton Thomas (known on social media as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/doctorcarlton/?hl=en"&gt;@DoctorCarlton&lt;/a&gt;) told me that most of the long-term consequences of fisting are a result of injuries—getting permanently stretched out is a lesser concern, because of what Thomas refers to as the anus’s “incredible snapback,” though it is possible. Said injuries can include bleeding, tearing, and hemorrhoids, &lt;a href="https://bespokesurgical.com/2024/11/14/anal-fisting-guide/"&gt;according to anal surgeon Evan Goldstein&lt;/a&gt;. Stephen Goldstone’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ins-Outs-Gay-Sex-Handbook/dp/0440508460"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex: A Medical Handbook for Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; elaborates:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;div data-editable="text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big toys or fisting can be dangerous. Any stiff, long object may not negotiate the natural bend in your colon and tear through the wall—an extremely dangerous situation that requires emergency surgery to repair. Thick toys (especially fists) can damage your sphincter muscle and may eventually lead to an inability to control your bowels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="17" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hw0e001y3b76nxcb65hx@published"&gt;And as with other anal play, pain is a distinct possibility, as is the transmission of STIs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="202" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7hw2l001z3b76ye3eezh5@published"&gt;There are guys who absolutely love fisting and find connectedness through the act, in spite (and in some cases because) of the risks. More potential danger yields more vulnerability. That said, this is not really beginner play and the intensity alone makes it something that you should only try if you really want it. “This doesn’t sound like a good idea,” isn’t convincing me that you’re a good candidate to get fisted. One of Thomas’s tips is to get fisted by an experienced fister, who can serve as a guide and hopefully troubleshoot in the moment. I’m not sure if your boyfriend qualifies but if you really want to dabble, I suggest bringing in a fisting top who can show both of you the ropes. He should be communicative, use lots of lube, and offer a covering for his fist (like a &lt;a href="https://www.mysextoyguide.com/best-fisting-gloves/"&gt;glove&lt;/a&gt;) which can help smooth the texture. You almost certainly won’t be able to take a whole fist the first time you try (progressive dilation is key), so someone with the knowledge of this and attendant patience would also be essential. You can vet him ahead of time to see just how much of this he already knows and practices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyof003c3b76rqkpwjvg@published"&gt;A month ago my husband and I spent a week at my sister’s home out of state. The trouble is we left a cock ring behind. I went through our suitcases more than a dozen times without finding it. We brought it with us, so I’m certain it must have been lost there. She hasn’t contacted us to let us know she found it or mentioned it in the time we’ve spoken since the visit. It has sentimental value, but I’m embarrassed as hell to ask if she came across it. My husband says to grow up: We’re all adults, my sister knows what sex is, and to just ask her already. Is he right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyog003f3b76mrw33hee@published"&gt;Firstly, I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; the idea of attaching sentimental value to a cock ring. It’s like a grown-up &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Call it &lt;em&gt;Sex Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine what all the sex toys get up to when you aren’t looking! Imagine how their existential grief intermingles with stigma-fueled shame when their owner wants to throw them away! After all, there’s no Goodwill section for sex toys.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t remember but I feel like no—those movies, in my recollection, have consistently perpetuated the deep ties that we have to inanimate objects. With all due respect to those who find themselves sexually attracted to or even in love with said objects, if you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get over this, it’s probably easier just to get a new cock ring. They are plentiful. That way you could avoid having the conversation with your sister entirely, since the prospect of it vexes you so.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7jyog003h3b76h5vm7ljt@published"&gt;Otherwise, I side with your husband. Just ask. You don’t have to refer to it as a cock ring. Be vague and call it jewelry or a ring. Lie and say it’s a bandanna ring or a napkin ring. Tell her it’s a bangle for your doll’s arm. Obfuscate entirely: “We left something behind.” Or straight-up tell her it’s a cock ring. Decide what terminology is least uncomfortable for you and go with it. You’re both adults. This may be awkward and it may represent a new discursive frontier if you and your sister don’t typically discuss sex, but she shouldn’t hold your sexuality against you.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcf7llp8003v3b76z6xjfet8@published"&gt;I would really love a boyfriend, and I’m particularly attracted to big, beefy men. The problem is, I’m truly scared of them. I often have dreams about being assaulted by a man, and the bigger, beefier ones are more dangerous-seeming than the littler guys. Because of this, I’m thinking of dating less “masculine” guys, but that’s not actually what I’m attracted to. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/05/muscular-men-fear-sex-advice.html"&gt;Can you please help me figure out what to do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I've had an ECG but this didn't reveal anything abnormal. Do I need treatment? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; Palpitations involve the heart racing or beating abnormally. Some people may notice a thumping or feel an irregular heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sometimes this is accompanied by breathlessness or the need to cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Palpitations can be triggered by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/menopause/index.html" id="mol-7b6490e0-54fe-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, strenuous exercise, a lack of sleep, stress, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-7b62bc20-54fe-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, caffeine, nicotine and certain medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While uncomfortable, palpitations caused by one of these factors are not dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, heart palpitations can also be a sign of a potentially worrying heart rhythm condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, atrial fibrillation triggers an unsteady heartbeat and is caused by a problem with the electrical system that makes the heart beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atrial fibrillation also often leads to chest pain, difficulty exercising and shortness of breath. There are medicines that can control the rate and rhythm of the heart, such as beta blockers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Atrial fibrillation patients may also need surgery to manage the problem. In order to spot the cause of palpitations, patients are often told to wear a device called an electrocardiogram (ECG), which measures heart rhythm, for as long as five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because, for some patients, palpitations may occur only occasionally, making them difficult to pick up on a quick test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients who continue to have palpitations with no clear cause should ask their GP for further tests in order to find the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is important to remember that all conversations with a GP are confidential and cannot be shared with others without the patient's consent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;I'm 64 and recently found out my new partner is &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hpv/index.html" id="mol-9ec09720-54de-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" class=""&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt; positive. I want to get tested but my GP is also my neighbour, and I'm embarrassed to talk to her about my sex life. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; If personal relationships with a GP make it difficult to seek medical advice, registering with a different practice may be the most appropriate option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All conversations with a GP are confidential and cannot be shared with others without the patient's consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, some people understandably feel uncomfortable discussing sensitive topics with someone they know socially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In such cases, switching GP practices is straightforward and can be done via the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-9ec61560-54de-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; website:&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp"&gt; nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-gp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HPV – human papillomavirus – is a very common viral infection, typically passed on through sexual contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around eight in ten people will contract it at some point and, in most cases, it is harmless. However, in rare instances it can lead to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the primary cause of cervical cancer, which is why NHS cervical screening &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7912671/Cervical-cancer-rates-steep-rise-women-late-20s-charity-warns.html" class=""&gt;includes HPV testing for women aged 25 to 64&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women over this age are not routinely screened, as evidence suggests that a new HPV infection at this age is unlikely to progress to cervical cancer. This is because cancerous changes in the cervix usually take decades to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those over 65 who missed their final cervical screening, an HPV test can still be requested. The most reliable way to access this is through a sexual health clinic, as not all GP surgeries offer the test, whereas all NHS sexual health services do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-8e21c9d0-54dd-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14858035/Dr-Ellie-cannon-sex-hpv-fat-jabs-wegovy-ozempic-gp.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Can't focus? You may lack iron&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I'm concerned that many people do not know the signs of an iron deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A friend of mine recently went to donate blood and was turned away because a quick test revealed she was anaemic – meaning she has low levels of the crucial nutrient iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had no idea, and many of my patients are surprised to find out they have anaemia too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body needs iron to transport oxygen to the organs. Without enough of it, it can cause tiredness, shortness of breath, headaches and heart palpitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some sufferers also struggle to concentrate. The problem is more common among women. It's also linked to poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is easily treated, by changing diet or taking iron supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you found out that you have anaemia? Did it affect your focus? Please use the email address on the right to let me know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic"&gt;My knees are weak. They aren't sore or inflamed, but when I crouch down I can't get up unless I push off the floor with my hands. What could be the reason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Ellie responds:&lt;/span&gt; Weakness in the legs is unlikely to be caused by an issue with the knees. Instead, there's a greater chance that it's due to problems in the surrounding muscles. Knee problems, like arthritis, tend to trigger pain in the joint or visible swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later life, many people develop a condition called sarcopenia. This is where the muscles slowly reduce in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best way to combat sarcopenia is to undertake strength-training exercises. These include lifting weights, using exercise bands and doing squats and lunges. These exercises are proven to build and maintain strong muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is different to cardiovascular exercise, such as running or swimming, which is also good for the body but won't necessarily fend off sarcopenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The knees are primarily supported by the quadricep muscles, also known as the quads, which make up the front of the thigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone struggling with strength in this area of the body might benefit from a few sessions with a physiotherapist or personal trainer who can teach you some exercises that might help. Any sudden and severe muscle weakness should be investigated by a GP as it can be a sign of disease, such as an autoimmune condition like thyroid disease or lupus. A GP can run blood tests to rule out these problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle weakness can also sometimes be a side effect of certain medications such as statins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-6c571f80-54dd-11f0-b287-3912c419fef0" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14858035/Dr-Ellie-cannon-sex-hpv-fat-jabs-wegovy-ozempic-gp.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;It'll be a long wait for NHS weight-loss jabs&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last week as it was announced that GPs could start &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13492567/UK-health-chiefs-weight-loss-U-turn-NHS-watchdog-gives-green-light-King-Kong-slimming-jab-Mounjaro-year-refusing-approve-it.html"&gt;prescribing the weight-loss drug Mounjaro on the NHS&lt;/a&gt;, I was not impressed by the way it was handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health Secretary Wes Streeting claimed it could 'end the obesity epidemic' and the jabs would be available to 'everyone who needs them'. This does not reflect reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Only people who are severely obese and have four serious weight-related health conditions can be prescribed weight-loss jabs on the NHS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently only people who are severely obese and have four serious weight-related health conditions can get them on the NHS. The day after the announcement my practice was swamped with patients asking for a Mounjaro prescription. None of them qualified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the restrictions will be eased over time, most people who want these jabs will have to wait a very long time before they can get them on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Have you tried to get an NHS Mounjaro prescription?

Novelty challenges the brain. Learning something new, such as a language or musical instrument, forces the brain to process and store new information. This practice will create fresh neural pathways. A 2014&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4154531/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;in older adults found that learning a new and cognitively demanding skill, such as quilting or photography, boosted their memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, another 2019&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6868000/" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;found that bilingualism, the ability to speak two languages, significantly increases and strengthens the connectivity between different areas in the brain. This can delay and decrease the risk of Alzheimer's and several other forms of dementia. You can seek the help of language training apps or enroll in a course, or pick up an instrument.

Constant bloating or gas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your stomach feels like a balloon after meals, it’s not “normal.” It’s a red flag that your gut is struggling to break down food efficiently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Skin breakouts (even in your 30s)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acne, rashes, or eczema can often be traced back to internal inflammation caused by poor &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/antibiotics-killing-your-gut-bacteria-doctor-shares-best-foods-to-eat-for-healing-and-balance-101739512909450.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gut bacteria"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Brain fog or poor focus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 90% of your serotonin (the feel-good hormone) is produced in your gut. If your mind feels cloudy or unfocused, your gut might be the missing link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Irregular bowel movements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diarrhoea, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/constipation" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="constipation"&gt;constipation&lt;/a&gt;, or unpredictable toilet routines? Your gut is literally telling you something is off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Sugar cravings or energy slumps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craving sugar all the time or crashing by 3pm? An imbalanced gut can mess with your &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/blood-sugar" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="blood sugar"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and hunger signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Always tired, no matter how much you sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A damaged gut affects nutrient absorption. So even if you eat well, your body might not be getting what it needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The truth is: gut issues don’t always scream. Sometimes, they whisper through mood swings, dull skin, or a sluggish brain,” says Dr. Sumit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
