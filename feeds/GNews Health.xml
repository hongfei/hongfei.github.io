At Chester Zoo alone, seven baby elephants have died of it over the last decade. It has also been found in wild elephant herds and in some sanctuaries and elephant orphanages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It causes a haemorrhagic disease - uncontrolled bleeding that can be fatal within 24 hours. It results in death in more than 80% of cases in juvenile elephants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Why EEHV can be so dangerous is still unknown. Many adult elephants carry the virus - apparently with no negative impact on their health. But it is thought that young calves are particularly vulnerable when they are being weaned, and when the immune-boosting antibodies from the mother's milk decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;At this stage, a calf's immune system is in a delicate balance and it can become overwhelmed. "It can cause really severe disease," Dr Katie Edwards, lead conservation scientist at Chester Zoo told BBC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"It does affect wild elephants, but we don't have an exact number of how many deaths in total it has caused. For elephants in human care [in zoos and sanctuaries] though, there have been more than 100 deaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a428/live/74e24770-a036-11f0-b32c-470ff9a6561d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Falko Steinbach/APHA Two wild Asian elephants, in a lush green forest, feed on leaves.

Essentially, the basic structure of this vaccine is identical to one routinely used to immunise elephants against a virus called cowpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The scientists seeded this vaccine structure with proteins from EEHV - non-infectious bits of the virus that the elephant's immune system might recognise and respond to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In a world-first trial, the team tested the new vaccine in three healthy, adult elephants at Chester Zoo, then analysed blood samples from the innoculated animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Steinbach told BBC News that the results, published in the journal Nature Communications were "better than we had hoped for".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"They showed, unequivocally that the vaccine was able to stimulate the production of [immune cells called] T cells, that are crucial to fighting viral infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The next step for the scientists is to test the vaccine in younger elephants, which are the animals most vulnerable to severe disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The current vaccination requires four injections to be given, so another aim is to work out if the same protective dose can be given in a simpler way - perhaps with fewer jabs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Dr Edwards explained: "Ultimately we want to use this vaccine in the elephants that are at risk, so we want to make sure that we can get it to where it's needed." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Steinbach added: "We think this is a significant step forward, and not necessarily only for the elephants, but because it also shows that you can design and apply vaccines to help endangered species."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 ilsLtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 hagXkB hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fe2b/live/cf9d8350-a036-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Falko Steinbach/University of Surrey A row of brightly coloured vials - labelled EEHV antigen - are lined up on a laboratory bench.

Ninety-nine patients needed to be hospitalized as a result of the outbreak, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" target="_blank"&gt;two young girls died.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b8a5a4" class="body-graf"&gt;In Minnesota, as of Thursday afternoon one child had been hospitalized at Children’s Minnesota, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-933be7" class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the Minnesota cases are among families who traveled within the U.S., according to the state’s health department. None of the children had received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. It was unclear, however, whether the patients were old enough to qualify for the shots, usually given in two doses starting around age 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eea878" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/measles/index.php" target="_blank"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, too, is dealing with a large, growing outbreak that has spread across the area bordering southwestern Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5e75d" class="body-graf"&gt;Fifty-nine cases have been confirmed in Arizona, with one hospitalization. Most cases are in Mohave County, located in the state’s far northwestern corner, bordering Utah. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8ea21a" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can safely say that we are actually a part of Northern Arizona’s outbreak,” said David Heaton, public information officer for the Southwest Utah Public Health Department. “There’s one town that straddles the state line, and all of our cases appear to be linked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7ba737" class="body-graf"&gt;Forty-four measles cases have been identified in &lt;a href="https://epi.utah.gov/measles-response/" target="_blank"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt;, largely among unvaccinated young people. Five needed to be admitted to the hospital but have since recovered, Heaton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6e4aca" class="body-graf"&gt;If outbreaks continue around the country until the end of January, the United States will lose its status of having had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;eliminated measles&lt;/a&gt; 25 years ago. This week, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 1,544 confirmed measles&lt;/a&gt; cases.

However, with antibiotic resistance now a growing problem, phage therapy might be set for a dramatic comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that bacteria are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-study-warns"&gt;continually evolving&lt;/a&gt; to put up better defenses against the drugs we're throwing at them, so treatments that were once very effective can sometimes end up being useless. It's a major problem &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drug-resistant-bacteria-expected-to-kill-tens-of-millions-by-2050"&gt;for public health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, led by researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel and the University of Melbourne in Australia, phage therapy shows promise in the fight against antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are challenges to overcome. Bacteria can also develop tricks to outsmart &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage"&gt;the bacteriophages&lt;/a&gt; behind phage therapy, so understanding how that occurs will be important, moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-own-mouth-bacteria-could-give-you-a-heart-attack-new-study-suggests"&gt;Your Own Mouth Bacteria Could Give You a Heart Attack, New Study Suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the arms race between phages and bacteria not only deepens our knowledge of how bacteria defend themselves but also opens the door to next-generation treatments," &lt;a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/revisiting-a-100-year-old-medical-treatment-to-tackle-the-growing-crisis-of-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; molecular biologist Debnath Ghosal, from the University of Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took a close look at the bacterium &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_subtilis"&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and a variety of phages used to tackle it. Watching &lt;em&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/em&gt; work through its blocking tactics, researchers found the protein YjbH – seen in many bacteria – played a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174584" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174584" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection.jpg" alt="Phage protection" class="wp-image-174584 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection-415x415.jpg 415w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/PhageProtection-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174584" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers determined how YjbH protects bacteria cells. (Fiyaksel et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Rep.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacteriophages work by attaching themselves &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus-that-murders-sleeping-bacteria-could-be-used-to-assassinate-superbugs"&gt;to bacteria cells&lt;/a&gt;, essentially hijacking these cells to duplicate and spread. That's done with an injection of bacteriophage DNA, and eventually the bacterial cell bursts, releasing more phages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What YjbH does is sense this invasion and take steps to limit the damage, effectively roping off the spot where the bacteriophage has attached itself. The cell then divides, in an attempt discard the roped off area and hopefully survive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/case-study-shows-promise-of-specialized-bacteriophage-treatments-for-fight-against-superbugs"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This 'exclude and survive' defense mechanism may represent a prevalent strategy employed by the host to contain viral spread," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115994"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an impressive escape strategy, and it's the first time scientists have seen it used to defend against bacteriophage attack. Before now, it was thought to be something only more complex, multicellular organisms could do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we're aware of it, of course, we might be able to develop phage therapy approaches that get around it too – making phage therapy a more viable alternative or complementary treatment &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mixing-coffee-and-antibiotics-could-be-a-bad-idea-study-shows"&gt;to antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's still a long way off, because bacteria defense mechanisms are just one of several issues with phage therapy. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40560-024-00759-7"&gt;Recent studies&lt;/a&gt; have found this strategy to be limited in its effectiveness, in part because the body's immune system sees the bacteriophages as threats, and works to try to wipe them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, plenty of groups think there's enough potential here – and enough of a crisis in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/achilles-heel-of-drug-resistant-bacteria-has-been-found-scientists-say"&gt;antibiotic treatments&lt;/a&gt; – for further investigation into phage therapies to be worthwhile, which is the plan for the researchers behind this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that by reactivating phage therapy, we can contribute to non-antibiotic treatments for infections," &lt;a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/revisiting-a-100-year-old-medical-treatment-to-tackle-the-growing-crisis-of-antibiotic-resistance"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; Ghosal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With so many antibiotic-resistant infections emerging, after 100 years, it's time to reconsider the benefits of phage therapy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115994"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If I were to go back, here are three things that I would do to protect myself. 20-minute walk daily to boost circulation and brain health. 7 to 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep to help vital recovery. And simple home-cooked food. I cannot emphasise this enough.

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who wants to live a long and healthy life wants a magic formula for reaching a ripe old age. Unfortunately, it isn’t that easy ― but there are some things you can do to bolster your odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;″If you want to live longer, improve what you’re eating and start moving your body more,&lt;strong&gt;”&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://about.kaiserpermanente.org/health-and-wellness/recipes/contributors/dr-linda-shiue" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7949949" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Linda Shiue&lt;/a&gt;, an internist and director of culinary and lifestyle medicine at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But knowing exactly which foods to eat for a longer life can be tricky. Shiue says that while no one needs to be perfect, it’s important to fill up on “foods in their natural state, like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs and nuts.” By doing so, she said, we replace the “ultra-processed foods” in our diets, “such as shelf-stable foods that have refined carbs and high sugars, like white bread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even when we know which foods are good for us, it can be hard to figure out the right balance of healthy options that give us a better chance of living longer ― and hard to find sweets that are good for us when the craving strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked three top longevity experts what’s in their grocery carts. Here’s what they told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruciferous Vegetables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

Another, as new variants Stratus and Nimbus spike this winter, is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3rv3y9jnryo" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;"razor-sharp" sore throat&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You walk into a room and forget why you’re there. Names evaporate right after introductions. We’ve all been there before. It’s frustrating, yes, but it doesn’t mean inevitable decline—especially if you make an effort to train your brain. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Two clinicians who specialize in cognitive health point to a single, evidence-based habit that boosts memory without pricey pills or complex routines: structured cognitive training, also called “brain training.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Brain health isn’t something you buy; it’s something you build,” says &lt;a href="https://drdivanyoung.com/dr-d-ivan-young-icf-master-certified-coach-peak-performance-coaching/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;D. Ivan Young, Ph.D., MCC, NBC-HWC&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s often the smallest, most consistent changes that deliver the biggest results.” Cognitive training focuses on active strategies—like self-quizzing and regular practice—to strengthen your memory over time. Keep reading to learn the science behind cognitive training and how to get started today.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-cognitive-training-is-the-best-activity-for-better-memory"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why Cognitive Training Is the Best Activity for Better Memory &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “What gives me hope and what I see in both research and my coaching practice is how adaptable the brain truly is,” says Young. “Cognitive training remains one of the most effective tools for strengthening memory. Thankfully, it doesn’t require flashy tech or long hours. It’s simply about being intentional.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cognitive training is not a passive process—like rereading or highlighting notes—but instead involves deliberate, structured practice, Young explains. It involves active retrieval of information (like quizzing yourself), spacing out learning (reviewing material over time) and interleaving (mixing topics). Together, these methods strengthen the brain’s pathways for storing and retrieving information. Here’s why it works.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Helps Your Brain Retrieve Information More Efficiently &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Every day, we rely on our brain to recall information—whether it’s a name, a fact or the storyline of a favorite movie. Cognitive training helps the brain retrieve stored memory more efficiently, but it only works with consistent challenges over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Young compares it to training at the gym: watching someone lift doesn’t build muscle—resistance does. Retrieval practice provides that “resistance” for your brain. This can include activities like quizzing yourself on new facts or vocabulary, explaining a concept to someone else from memory, mentally recalling events from your day or practicing mental math instead of using a calculator. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The key is to train your brain regularly over the long term. Research in older adults shows that spacing out learning beats cramming, leading to a stronger recall even a month later. To retain information, it’s best to learn and review gradually over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Strengthens Your Brain Through Gradual, Targeted Practice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/g.-peter-gliebus/2730213" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Gediminas Gliebus, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, says the key is to challenge your brain regularly, track your progress and notice how these activities make everyday memory tasks easier.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Done right, cognitive training uses “just-hard-enough” difficulty with measurable progression. You should challenge yourself so that the task isn’t easy, but still achievable with some effort. As you improve, continue to increase the difficulty. Young recommends 15- to 30-minute sessions a few times per week as a sustainable and effective routine. For example, you may play strategy or puzzle games that gradually become harder as you advance through levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For an added challenge, combine mental exercises with light physical movement—like walking while mentally rehearsing a list—which can further support memory in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “As I often remind my clients, the brain and body are in constant communication,” says Young. “When you take care of one, you support the other.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Provides Lasting Results &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Training can have lasting benefits, not just quick fixes,” says Gliebus. If you put in the work, you can see lasting results that apply to various areas of your life.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, a five-year study in older adults found that those who trained their memory regularly maintained stronger thinking skills compared to those who didn’t. This suggests that cognitive training can deliver long-term, meaningful results for your memory.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a Focus.&lt;/strong&gt; To start, identify an area you would like to improve on, such as remembering names, retaining new information or recalling information quickly. Then, choose a form of training that supports it. For example, face-name associations using flashcards, quizzing yourself after learning a new topic, or “spot the difference” puzzles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Retrieval, Not Review.&lt;/strong&gt; When learning something new, take a moment to retrieve the information you just learned. For example, close the book you’re reading and quiz yourself, or try teaching the material to someone else out loud. Young likens retrieval to the “resistance” that strengthens memory traces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spread It Out.&lt;/strong&gt; Start with 15 to 30 minutes, three times per week. “Aim for short sessions three times a week, ideally when you feel most alert,” says Gliebus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue to Challenge Yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; When recall feels easy—high accuracy with little effort—it’s time to increase the difficulty. This may include recalling longer lists, choosing harder puzzles or learning more complicated topics. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage Simple Strategies.&lt;/strong&gt; “Practicing memory tricks like visualization or storytelling works because you’re actively recalling, not just rereading,” says Gliebus. “For example, if you’re trying to remember a grocery list, picture the items in your kitchen or make up a story that links them together. Consider puzzles, learning a new skill like a language or instrument, or playing strategy games like chess, too.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include Other Healthy Habits.&lt;/strong&gt; Combining brain exercises with other healthy lifestyle habits—such as exercise, healthy eating and quality sleep—has been shown to further support memory, attention and cognitive function in older adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Reasonable Expectations.&lt;/strong&gt; Remember that results take time—cognitive training improves the skills you practice most, and broader day-to-day benefits may take several weeks or months to appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-to-see-a-health-care-provider"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When to See a Health Care Provider &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Forgetting where you put your keys, having trouble recalling someone’s name or briefly losing track of why you walked into a room are all normal parts of aging. “These kinds of lapses typically don’t interfere with daily life, and most people experience them from time to time,” says Gliebus. “What’s more concerning is when memory problems happen often, keep getting worse or interfere with everyday routines.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gliebus says red flags include forgetting meaningful conversations, missing bills or medications, or struggling to manage daily tasks. “If memory issues are affecting independence or are paired with problems in reasoning, judgment or language, it’s a good idea to get checked by a health care provider.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Improving memory takes deliberate effort, and cognitive training is one of the most effective ways to do it. By challenging your brain in a structured, progressive way, you strengthen everyday memory skills. Start small, stay consistent and gradually increase the challenge. Mixing different exercises can keep your training engaging and help target multiple aspects of memory. Over time, you’ll notice improvements in real-life tasks—like remembering names, appointments and details from conversations. It’s not a quick fix, but with patience and practice, cognitive training delivers lasting results—no pills, gadgets or expensive programs needed. Your brain is capable of growth, and consistent effort lets you unlock its full potential.&lt;br&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We spend a third of our lives asleep. And a quarter of our time asleep is spent dreaming. So, for the average person alive in 2022, with a life expectancy of around &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy"&gt;73&lt;/a&gt;, that clocks in at just over six years of dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, given the central role that dreaming plays in our lives, we still know so little about why we dream, how the brain creates dreams, and importantly, what the significance of our dreams might be for our health – especially the health of our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My 2022 study, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet's&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00370-4/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt;, showed that our dreams can reveal a surprising amount of information about our brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, it showed that having frequent bad dreams and nightmares (bad dreams that make you wake up) during middle or older age, may be linked with an increased risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dementia/symptoms/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chronic-insomnia-may-spark-changes-in-the-brain-that-trigger-dementia"&gt;Chronic Insomnia May Spark Changes in The Brain That Trigger Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, I analyzed data from three large US studies of health and aging. These included over 600 people aged between 35 and 64, and 2,600 people aged 79 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were dementia-free at the start of the study and were followed for an average of nine years for the middle-aged group and five years for the older participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the study (2002-12), the participants completed a range of questionnaires, including one which asked about how often they experienced bad dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg" alt="man in bed surrounded by hands" class="wp-image-143068 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nightmare_hands-600x325.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143068" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Frequent nightmares could be a sign of declining mental health. (Kirk Marsh/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I analyzed the data to find out whether participants with a higher frequency of nightmares at the beginning of the study were more likely to go on to experience cognitive decline (a fast decline in memory and thinking skills over time) and be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Weekly nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found that middle-aged participants who experienced nightmares every week, were four times more likely to experience cognitive decline (&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12704"&gt;a precursor to dementia)&lt;/a&gt; over the following decade, while the older participants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the connection between nightmares and future dementia was much stronger for men than for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, older men who had nightmares every week were five times more likely to develop dementia compared with older men reporting no bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In women, however, the increase in risk was only 41 percent. I found a very similar pattern in the middle-aged group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these results suggest frequent nightmares may be one of the earliest signs of dementia, which can precede the development of memory and thinking problems by several years or even decades – especially in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, it is also possible that having regular bad dreams and nightmares might even be a cause of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the nature of this study, it is not possible to be certain which of these theories is correct (though I suspect it is the former).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, regardless of which theory turns out to be true – the major implication of the study remains the same, that is, that having regular bad dreams and nightmares during middle and older age may be linked to an increased risk of developing dementia later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that recurring nightmares are &lt;a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7178"&gt;treatable&lt;/a&gt;. And the first-line medical treatment for nightmares has already been shown to decrease the build-up of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458012004666?via%3Dihub"&gt;abnormal proteins&lt;/a&gt; linked to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Illustration of yellow clumps on pink nerve cells" class="size-full wp-image-143082" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-621x415.jpg 621w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesOnNeuron_R_U_642-600x401.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143082" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Abnormal clumps of amyloid-beta proteins are linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="176092" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.

This will be an important avenue to explore in future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fda-approved-sleeping-pill-slows-alzheimers-tangles-in-pre-clinical-trial?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;FDA-Approved Sleeping Pill Slows Alzheimer's Tangles in Pre-Clinical Trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next steps for my research include investigating whether nightmares in young people might also be linked to increased dementia risk. This could help to determine whether nightmares cause dementia, or whether they are simply an early sign in some people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also plan to investigate whether other dream characteristics, such as how often we remember our dreams and how vivid they are, might also help to determine how likely people are to develop dementia in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research might not only help to shed light on the relationship between dementia and dreaming, and provide new opportunities for earlier diagnoses – and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;earlier interventions&lt;/a&gt; – but it may also shed new light on the nature and function of the mysterious phenomenon that we call &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-do-we-dream/"&gt;dreaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/191016/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrer-policy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;President &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-autism-tylenol-medical-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Trump's suggestion last week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that combination childhood vaccines, including the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, shot, should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was shocked," said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "Those vaccines don't even exist in the U.S."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moss said he hadn't heard such a recommendation "since the Andrew Wakefield days," referring to the former doctor whose 1988 autism study was later &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3136032/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;retracted as fraudulent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigations revealed Wakefield had undisclosed financial interests in both lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and a single-measles vaccine patent. His license to practice medicine was revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Trump's remarks also drew in Wakefield himself. In a video posted on social media, he said the president was "adopting the very recommendation that I made back in 1998," when he first called for splitting the MMR vaccine into individual components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is a return to a discredited strategy," Moss said. "Wakefield had a financial stake in undermining MMR, and the science has never supported his claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risks of splitting the MMR vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes of splitting a combination vaccine are not abstract, Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical historian, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The immunization schedules are very carefully worked out so the vaccines have the most immunogenicity at the right age," he explained. "If you start splitting things up, you create barriers. Parents don't always come back, or they pick and choose, and coverage goes down. It's as simple as that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, argued that the call to split vaccines is part of a broader campaign to discredit vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Every couple of weeks, there's a new zinger: first &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/sites/default/files/vaccine-education-center-thimerosal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-schedule/science-behind-vaccine-schedule" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;spacing&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, now splitting MMR," he said. "Eventually, this topples the whole vaccine infrastructure like a house of cards."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical risks of dismantling the MMR schedule are clear. Measles remains one of the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;most contagious viruses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in circulation, capable of igniting outbreaks wherever vaccination rates dip. Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, leaving babies with deafness, blindness or heart defects. Mumps, too often dismissed as mild, can lead to infertility in adolescent males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programmatic consequences are equally significant. Moss pointed out that parents already complain about too many injections. Splitting MMR into separate shots would increase both the number of visits and the number of needles children face, while weakening protection against rubella and mumps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every extra appointment creates barriers, especially for families with limited resources, Markel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Walt Orenstein, a former head of CDC's immunization program, described combination vaccines as the foundation of modern prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Combination vaccines were developed to reduce missed opportunities, increase coverage and minimize the trauma of multiple injections," he said. "Undoing that progress would put children at risk." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles-only vaccines also don't exist in the U.S. You can't walk into a pediatrician's office or retail pharmacy and ask for a standalone shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a measles-only vaccine available in the United States, a manufacturer would need to wait for measles outbreaks to occur, in order to test the vaccine in new clinical trials. Then they'd have to submit data for FDA approval and build a production and distribution system essentially from scratch. With no market for monovalent measles vaccines, companies would also have to be convinced there was sustainable demand — something experts say is unlikely given the entrenched use of MMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Recycled claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objections to combined vaccines are not new, UC Berkeley medical historian Elena Conis noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Resistance to vaccines and concerns about the form and content of vaccines is as old as vaccination itself," she said. "And concerns about combined vaccines are as old as combined vaccines themselves." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pointed out that even before Wakefield, parents in the 1970s were asking why they couldn't just get some vaccines separately, echoing debates over the DPT (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New momentum to separate measles from the rubella component is also driven by a recurring myth: that the rubella vaccine "contains fetal parts." In reality, the rubella virus was originally grown in human fetal cell lines developed in the 1960s, which have been replicated ever since without further abortions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During production, the virus is purified, leaving only trace DNA or protein fragments that are broken, biologically inactive, and present at levels far below natural background levels in food or the human body. Regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration confirm these levels are safe. Advocates for separating MMR often conflate this history with the false claim that vaccines contain fetal tissue. Decoupling rubella is presented as a moral corrective, even though it introduces practical barriers and undermines protection for pregnant women and babies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conis also emphasized that resistance often depends on how people perceive the seriousness of each disease. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc5" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",5]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public didn't always see the various infections as equal, Conis noted. At times rubella drew more fear than measles or mumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mumps in particular, she said, "was often treated with humor rather than fear, until the MMR vaccine came along and researchers began to highlight complications like infertility and hearing loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan offers a cautionary example. In the early 1990s, Japan withdrew the combined MMR vaccine following concerns about the safety of its mumps vaccine and reverted to measles-only shots. The result was lower uptake of rubella and mumps vaccines compared to measles, leaving gaps in protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades later, Japan has faced repeated rubella outbreaks, including epidemics in 2013 and 2018-2019 that sickened thousands and led to cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Because of earlier policies that vaccinated only girls against rubella, large cohorts of adult men remain under-immunized, forcing costly catch-up campaigns and leaving Japan vulnerable to epidemics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned splitting up the MMR vaccine would repeat past mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've been here before. Andrew Wakefield promoted single-antigen vaccines, and it nearly derailed measles control in the U.K. The science was fraudulent, but the damage was real: thousands of kids went unprotected. To revive that model in 2025 is to repeat one of the most damaging chapters in vaccine history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Columbia University historian James Colgrove noted that this kind of backlash has deep roots. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc6" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",6]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The original anti-vaccination movement in the 19th century was really a movement against state coercion," he said. "That's always been the paradox of compulsory vaccination: it's extremely effective, but it's also one of the most likely to trigger backlash."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conis framed the debate in broader terms of autonomy and mandates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's always been a tension in vaccination between individual choice and public health," she said. "Parents are asked to give up some autonomy for the promise of better health for the population. For some, that's acceptable. For others, individual freedom matters more, and what's different today is that we're seeing the libertarian approach gain support at the highest levels of government."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colgrove added that policymakers face a delicate balance. "The non-medical exemptions absolutely make laws more politically acceptable and are really key to diffusing backlash," he said. "At the same time, the broader your exemption, the more people you allow to opt out, then the more you risk compromising herd immunity. So it really is threading the needle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for Offit, the bigger danger is the pattern of misinformation itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These claims aren't new; they're recycled," he said. "Once doubt takes root, it's extraordinarily hard to restore public confidence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from multiple countries shows that combination vaccines improve uptake and timeliness by reducing missed appointments and the number of injections required. Children receiving combination formulations are more likely to complete their full schedule on time, and low-income parents are less likely to fall behind when multiple protections are delivered in a single shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program who recently resigned, the proposal reflects politics rather than science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This isn't about safety. It's about ideology," he said. "We've already seen directives issued without data to back them up." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the CDC's chief science and medical officer, echoed the concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The talk about separating MMR into individual components wasn't coming from scientists," she said. "It was being driven by political operatives with no public health expertise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Moss: "It's not necessary, and monovalent vaccines aren't even available in the United States. There's no reason to go down that path."&lt;/p&gt;

                It's been hard for parents to get their kids COVID shots recently, as well as for many healthy adults, since the CDC hasn't weighed in with official guidelines for administering them.

&lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Remy Sweeney-Garrett desperately wants to get her daughters vaccinated against COVID-19. But so far that's been impossible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm very worried, and frustrated," says Sweeney-Garrett, 34, who lives in Seattle with her 9-year-old daughter Maxine and 18-month-old daughter Maeve. "And, yeah, I'm angry."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sweeney-Garrett hasn't been able to get her daughters the shots because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to issue final guidelines for administering them. The rules are necessary for the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children Program&lt;/a&gt; to start shipping the vaccines to doctors, health departments and others. About half of U.S. kids are eligible for shots through the program.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I'm worried about my youngest daughter in particular having to go to the hospital because she is susceptible to respiratory complications," Sweeney-Garrett says. "And it's frustrating because I feel like this is within the control of the people in our government."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The lag by the CDC is very unusual. Typically, the CDC acts within days – sometimes hours – because of the urgency of getting shots into arms before the winter surge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The delay has created "a lot of confusion both among the public and even among providers around what the status is," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.astho.org/communications/newsroom/2025/susan-kansagra-named-astho-cmo/" target="_blank"&gt;Susan Kansagra&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sweeney-Garrett is far from alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have parents asking every day for vaccines. They want the COVID vaccine," says Dr. Elias Kass, who's the Sweeney-Garrett family's doctor. "And we don't have it. And we don't have an ETA. We don't have anything. We don't want kids to be sick. We have the opportunity to prevent that suffering. And we as a society are blowing it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's delay has also forced adults seeking vaccination to continue navigating an often confusing and frustrating patchwork of state rules that have, in many places, made it difficult if not impossible for them to get vaccinated too. Even though many states have taken steps to make it easier for people to get the vaccines, some still require prescriptions and some pharmacists are still turning away people who can't document they meet new eligibility requirements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It's a mess. And it's an easily avoidable mess," says &lt;a href="https://www.uclawsf.edu/people/dorit-reiss/" target="_blank"&gt;Dorit Reiss&lt;/a&gt;, who studies vaccine policies at the University of California, San Francisco. "They chose not to take action. I think it will harm public health and the result will be more COVID-19 and more harm from it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment or explanation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year's roll-out of the COVID vaccines has been unusually chaotic from the start. Until this year, anyone 6 months or older could get vaccinated by their pharmacist without a prescription. But for the first time this year, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/27/nx-s1-5515503/fda-covid-vaccines-restricted" target="_blank"&gt;only approved the new shots&lt;/a&gt; for people at risk for serious complications because of their age or health,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/11/nx-s1-5538105/covid-vaccine-shots-pharmacy-fda" target="_blank"&gt; causing widespread confusion and frustration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then the CDC's powerful &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;, which Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. packed with &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee" target="_blank"&gt;like-minded anti-vaccine members, &lt;/a&gt;weighed in about the nuts and bolts of making them widely available.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a tumultuous two-day meeting last month, Kennedy's committee recommended adding&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/19/nx-s1-5545946/cdc-covid-vaccine-acip-recommendations" target="_blank"&gt; a new hoop to getting vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, but also took steps that could &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/13/nx-s1-5540088/covid-vaccine-2025-cdc-fda-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;make more people eligible&lt;/a&gt;, let more pharmacists give the shots and start shipping the vaccines for kids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the CDC has yet to accept those recommendations— freezing everything in limbo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is a critical piece of enabling downstream access," says Kansagra of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "It's a huge problem."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And now with the government shut down, no one knows when the CDC might finally act or what the agency might do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Officials are especially worried because of the upcoming winter respiratory reason.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't know exactly how bad a season it could be, but it could certainly be very bad," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.bigcitieshealth.org/people/philip-huang/" target="_blank"&gt;Philip Huang&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Dallas Health and Human Services department in Texas. "It's very frustrating. Our jobs are being made harder rather than easier."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A 37-year-old woman’s bruising from a massage gun ended up having a cause stranger than anyone could have expected. In a recent report, doctors documented how the woman had developed the rare condition scurvy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors at the University of Pennsylvania detailed the bizarre turn of events in a paper &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcps2500075"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in the New England Journal of Medicine as part of a regular segment highlighting medically complex cases. The woman’s bruising was only the first sign of worsening health issues that eventually landed her in the hospital. Fortunately, after several false leads, her clinicians correctly diagnosed the woman’s vitamin C deficiency, and she made a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;“The current case serves as a reminder that scurvy continues to occur in the United States…”&lt;/aside&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The wrong culprit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the woman visited the emergency room four days into having acute pain, swelling, and bruising on the upper portion of her left knee—symptoms that began after she used an electric massage gun on that area. She carried a genetic mutation that increased her general risk of blood clotting, which was managed with a blood thinner, and also had a long history of heavy menstrual bleeding. Anyone can potentially bruise or hurt themselves by applying too much pressure with a massage gun, though, and since initial tests didn’t find any other underlying reason for her symptoms, she was discharged and simply told to stop using the gun.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Several weeks later, however, she visited the ER again, now with new symptoms of lightheadedness and shortness of breath while exerting herself. She was then admitted to the hospital. The doctors suspected she had anemia caused by a lack of iron, and she was discharged with a prescription for iron pills and weekly IV infusions of iron.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Despite her treatment, her anemia and overall health continued to worsen, however. She visited the ER once more six weeks after her hospitalization with new chest pain, night sweats, and a sudden weight loss of 15 pounds. She now also had a high heart rate and low blood oxygen level, and soon enough, she was admitted to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Doctors determined she had developed pulmonary hypertension, a life-threatening type of high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs and right side of the heart. But all of their tests continued to show no clear indication of what was causing her illness in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout all of this, her left leg continued to show bruising and swelling. And when doctors reexamined both legs, they found distinctive discolored spots and hairs curled up into a corkscrew shape. They also found she had developed “red-purple soft nodules” along her gums. Unlike her earlier, more general symptoms, these skin problems finally pointed to a very specific, if now rarely encountered, culprit: scurvy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When questioned, the woman admitted that she had purposefully avoided eating anything containing citrus fruits years ago, following an episode of hives that she attributed to eating citrus. Testing failed to detect any vitamin C in her system, and she was immediately started on supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Just two days into her new therapy, she was discharged from the ICU and eventually the hospital as well. Her health continued to steadily improve over the next few months, and follow-up testing showed that her heart issues had cleared up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rare but still around&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the widespread knowledge that we need regular doses of vitamin C from our diets, scurvy is no longer the fearsome threat it was centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even today, doctors do still occasionally see it. Some research has also &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/scurvy-is-making-a-surprising-comeback-2000509979'"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that the incidence of scurvy in the U.S. has climbed lately, particularly among vulnerable groups like children with sensory issues, elderly people, and others struggling to eat or afford healthy fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This case was stranger than most, though, since pulmonary hypertension usually isn’t linked to scurvy. The authors note that the condition is often hard to diagnose at first because—as is with this case—the earliest signs tend to be non-specific symptoms potentially caused by many different things. So as rare as it is, the doctors hope their report can provide doctors a timely lesson that scurvy is still around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The current case serves as a reminder that scurvy continues to occur in the United States and highlights its potential severity and clinical features,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                A new study found that artificial intelligence could design DNA for all kinds of dangerous proteins, and do it in such a way that DNA manufacturers' biosecurity screening measures would not reliably catch them.

   &lt;p&gt;Major biotech companies that churn out made-to-order DNA for scientists have protections in place to keep dangerous biological material out of the hands of would-be evil-doers. They screen their orders to catch anyone trying to buy, say, smallpox or anthrax genes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But now, a new &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8578" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; has demonstrated how AI could be used to easily circumvent those biosafety processes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A team of AI researchers found that protein-design tools could be used to "paraphrase" the DNA codes of toxic proteins, "re-writing them in ways that could preserve their structure, and potentially their function," says &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/horvitz/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eric Horvitz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft's chief scientific officer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The computer scientists used an AI program to generate DNA codes for more than 75,000 variants of hazardous proteins – and the firewalls used by DNA manufacturers weren't consistently able to catch them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To our concern," says Horvitz, "these reformulated sequences slipped past the biosecurity screening systems used worldwide by DNA synthesis companies to flag dangerous orders."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A fix quickly got written that and slapped onto the biosecurity screening software. But it's not perfect — it still wasn't able to detect a small fraction of the variants.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And it's just the latest episode showing how AI is revving up long-standing concerns about the potential misuse of powerful biological tools.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The perils of open science&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"AI-powered protein design is one of the most exciting frontiers in science. We're already seeing advances in medicine and public health," says Horvitz. "Yet like many powerful technologies, these same tools can often be misused."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, biologists have worried that their ever-improving DNA tools might be harnessed to design potent biothreats, like more virulent viruses or easy-to-spread toxins. They've even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/02/17/147053720/who-panel-supports-publication-of-bird-flu-details-eventually" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;debated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; whether it's really wise to openly publish certain experimental results, even though open discussion and independent replication has been the lifeblood of science.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The researchers and the journal who published this new study decided to hold some of their information back, and will restrict who gets access to their data and software. They enlisted a third party, a non-profit called the International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science, to make decisions about who has a legitimate need to know.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is the first time such a model has been employed to manage risks of sharing hazardous information in a scientific publication," says Horvitz.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Scientists who have been worried about future biosecurity threats for some time praised this work.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My overall reaction was favorable," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3126/arturo-casadevall" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arturo Casadevall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University. "Here we have a system in which we are identifying vulnerabilities. And what you're seeing is an attempt to correct the known vulnerabilities."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The trouble is, says Casadevall, "what vulnerabilities don't we know about that will require future corrections?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He notes that this team did not do any lab work to actually generate any of the proteins designed by AI, to see if they would truly mimic the activity of the biological original threats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Such work would be an important reality check as society grapples with this kind of emerging threat from AI, says Casadevall, but would be tricky to do, as it might be precluded by international treaties prohibiting the development of biological weapons.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Getting ahead of an AI "freight train"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time scientists have explored the potential for malevolent use of AI in a biological setting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, a few years ago, another team &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wondered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if AI could be used to generate novel molecules that would have the same properties as nerve agents. In less than six hours, the AI tool dutifully concocted 40,000 molecules that met the requested criteria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It not only came up with known chemical warfare agents like the notorious one called VX, but also designed many unknown molecules that looked plausible and were predicted to be more toxic. "We had transformed our innocuous generative model from a helpful tool of medicine to a generator of likely deadly molecules," the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That team also didn't openly publish the chemical structures that the AI tool had devised, or create them in the lab, "because they thought they were way too dangerous," points out &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/david-relman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;David Relman&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Stanford University. "They simply said, we're telling you all about this as a warning."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Relman thinks this latest study, showing how AI could be used to evade security screening and finding a way to address that, is laudable. At the same time, he says, it just illustrates that there's an enormous problem brewing. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it leaves us dangling and wondering, 'Well, what exactly are we supposed to do?'" he says. "How do we get ahead of a freight train that is just evermore accelerating and racing down the tracks, in danger of careening off the tracks?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite concerns like these, some biosecurity experts see reasons to be reassured.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Twist Bioscience is a major provider of made-to-order DNA, and in the past ten years, it's had to refer orders to law enforcement fewer than five times, says James Diggans, the head of policy and biosecurity at Twist Bioscience and chair of the board of directors at the International Gene Synthesis Consortium, an industry group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is an incredibly rare thing," he says. "In the cybersecurity world, you have a host of actors that are trying to access systems. That is not the case in biotech. The real number of people who are really trying to create misuse may be very close to zero. And so I think these systems are an important bulwark against that, but we should all find comfort in the fact that this is not a common scenario."&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;America’s terrible year of measles is far from over. Several states have reported more cases of the vaccine-preventable viral disease as of late, while the country as a whole has hit a new record high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health officials in Michigan, California, and Illinois confirmed new cases of measles this week. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2025 has seen the highest number of cases since the disease was locally eliminated from the country a quarter century ago. Though the largest outbreaks this year have since ended, there remains a real chance measles could once again reestablish itself in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New threats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials in &lt;a href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/press/measles-case-orange-county-1"&gt;Orange County, California&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://cookcountypublichealth.org/2025/09/30/cook-county-confirms-another-measles-case/"&gt;Cook County, Illinois,&lt;/a&gt; reported a single new case of measles each this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The California case involved a toddler who had recently traveled domestically, and officials have notified people who could have been exposed to the child at a health care setting. No other community exposure is suspected, however, since the family had been isolated during the most likely period for transmission.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Illinois case involved an adult who likely caught measles from an infected individual that health officials had identified several weeks earlier. It’s the third case reported in the county this year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The largest new threat of measles comes from Minnesota, however. The Minnesota Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/news/pressrel/2025/measles100125.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; 10 new cases this week, bringing the state’s total tally to 17 this year. Seven of the cases are connected to three earlier cases, while the remaining three are unrelated and tied to international travel, presumably from areas where measles remains endemic. As is often true, all of the new Minnesota cases have occurred among people unvaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as of September 30, there have been a total of 1,544 confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. so far this year, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; this week. 92% of these infections have involved people who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status. The tally in 2025 is well above the previous modern high—1,274 cases in 2019—and is the most since 1992, which saw over 2,000 cases.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Good and bad news&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the positive side of things, New Mexico officially &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/vaccine/2025/9/?view=2279"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; the end of its large-scale outbreak late last week. The state had documented 100 cases of measles dating back to February 2025, the second largest outbreak of any state this year. The largest outbreak occurred in Texas, which saw 762 cases; the state &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; its outbreak over in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These outbreaks didn’t end without causing their fair share of misery, however. Around 200 children have been hospitalized for measles this year in the U.S., for instance, while three have died from it—the first U.S. deaths reported in a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Measles can have long-term health consequences as well. Studies have shown, for instance, that measles can &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/measles-infection-can-cause-immune-amnesia"&gt;induce&lt;/a&gt; a form of “immune amnesia,” causing people’s immune systems to lose their memory of other past infections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These latest cases also demonstrate that measles can easily spark new clusters of illness at a moment’s notice, particularly in regions where vaccine uptake is relatively low. Only a handful of states in the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=subject%20to%20change.-,MMR%20vaccine%20coverage%20for%20kindergarteners%20by%20school%20year%20(2009%E2%80%932024),-The%20measles%2C%20mumps"&gt;currently have&lt;/a&gt; childhood vaccination rates for measles above 95%, the level at which herd immunity can reliably prevent widespread outbreaks. And even highly vaccinated states have communities where coverage is much lower than average (Texas’s overall vaccination rate in 2023 and 2024 was just a smidge below 95%, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while a majority of Americans &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/americans-are-already-sick-of-rfk-jr-poll-finds-2000665089"&gt;do still support&lt;/a&gt; vaccines and current vaccine requirements, many of the country’s leaders don’t seem to.  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-measles-cure-cod-liver-oil-and-a-whole-lot-of-other-nonsense-2000574321"&gt;downplayed&lt;/a&gt; the country’s measles outbreaks and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-cdc-implosion-continues-as-staff-plan-walkout-2000649819"&gt;regularly undermined&lt;/a&gt; vaccines since taking over as the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary this year, as has President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just last week, both men took the podium to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-too-much-liquid-trump-rfk-jr-still-gunning-for-vaccines-as-autism-cause-2000662667"&gt;once again endorse&lt;/a&gt; the debunked link between vaccines and autism. Trump also reiterated his support to separate the perfectly safe and effective combination measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine—a change that would undoubtedly lower vaccination rates for all three diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

According to Dr. Smith, this sign often goes unnoticed, “because we all do it to some degree. This means it allows chronic stress to go unaddressed for longer.” “How we numb stress may var,y but the function is the same. It is the trap that allows us to deny what’s really going on, as stress quietly builds in the background. Numbing out feels even more addictive when we are under stress because it offers such instant relief,” she said in a video shared on Instagram.  “Do you notice that your own personal preference for distraction and numbing creeps up and becomes more compulsive when you have a lot going on? Whether that is alcohol, food, doom scrolling, or anything else, stress nearly always comes before the need to numb and escape. And stress itself is a signal that you have been spending too much of your physical and mental resources and now need to put something back into replenish them,” she added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>斯德哥尔摩餐厅食物中毒爆发后四人患败血症- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd1g5y8755o</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Four people been diagnosed with sepsis after eating at a luxury restaurant in Stockholm that has been linked to a suspected listeria outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Health authorities say at least 15 people have been treated or are under observation in hospital after dining at Coco &amp;amp; Carmen, a high-end venue in the Swedish capital's Östermalm district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Most of the dozens affected are not seriously ill, officials in Stockholm say, and so far none of those admitted to hospital have required intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It is rare for food contaminated by listeria, a bacterium, to cause a very serious infection, known as listeriosis.

(CBS12)  — &lt;/span&gt;Millions of workers spend hours sitting at desks, often with minimal movement throughout the day. But what many don't realize is that this seemingly harmless routine can lead to serious long-term health issues — particularly lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that prolonged sitting puts significant strain on the lumbar spine and surrounding muscles. According to Dr. Z, a local physical therapist and owner of Elite Therapy and Wellness, the lack of movement causes hip flexors to tighten and glute muscles to weaken, both of which contribute to lower back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The body wasn’t designed to sit still for eight or more hours a day,” Dr. Z explains. He says when you stay in one position too long — especially seated — you compress the spine, reduce blood flow, and cause muscle imbalances that lead to pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower back pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal complaints in the United States. The American Chiropractic Association reports that up to 80% of people will experience lower back pain at some point in their lives, with sedentary lifestyles being a major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See also: &lt;a href="https://cbs12.com/news/health/whats-good-for-you-keeping-your-heart-healthy-american-heart-association-south-florida-west-palm-beach-processed-foods-blood-pressure-cholesterol-september-4-2025" target="_blank" title="https://cbs12.com/news/health/whats-good-for-you-keeping-your-heart-healthy-american-heart-association-south-florida-west-palm-beach-processed-foods-blood-pressure-cholesterol-september-4-2025" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;What's Good For You... keeping your heart healthy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Stretching Solution:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news?

    &lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s vaccine policies are confusing, to say the least, particularly for the COVID vaccine. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a Senate committee last month that anyone who wants a COVID vaccine &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-kennedy-rfk-congress-senate-vaccines-covid-deaths-hospitals-efa457f139dabcce6f54c0ac2c590512"&gt;can get one&lt;/a&gt;. But senators from both parties said Kennedy’s policies were effectively preventing access to the shot, citing incidents of people being turned away at pharmacies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) met last month, but some of its members—all selected by Kennedy—were themselves confused on how the panel’s actions affected vaccine access. Pharmacists have scrambled to determine if they are authorized to provide COVID vaccines and who is eligible to receive them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID vaccine access involves a complex web of federal law, national public health guidance, and state regulations that has left even health policy scholars scratching their heads. The confusion is partly the product of a national vaccination system that has been largely unified in practice despite legal and technical distinctions between state and the federal authorities. As the Trump administration has leaned into broader skepticism about vaccines and moved to restrict federal approvals and recommendations for the COVID vaccine, the system has begun to fragment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the COVID vaccine is broadly accessible on paper, but the confusion surrounding the administration’s policy changes has erected barriers to access in practice, particularly at pharmacies, where roughly &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/vaccinations-administered-pharmacies-medical.html"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of COVID vaccinations last year were administered.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this evolve? The policy changes began in May when Kennedy &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;unilaterally restricted&lt;/a&gt; the CDC’s COVID recommendations. He rescinded the agency’s guidance for routine COVID vaccination for healthy children, but the CDC modified the change days later to recommend that the decision to vaccinate children between 6 months and 17 years old be discussed with a health care provider. Kennedy also rescinded the CDC’s recommendation for pregnant women to receive the COVID vaccine, effectively removing the vaccine from the schedule entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the CDC’s guidance involves recommendations rather than mandates, virtually every state pegs its vaccine policies in some way to the CDC immunization schedule and or ACIP recommendations, including what vaccines pharmacists are allowed to administer. After Kennedy’s changes, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/12/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women#:~:text=Leigh%20Haldeman%2C%2033,get%20the%20shot."&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; soon emerged of pregnant women being repeatedly denied access to the vaccine at pharmacies despite recommendations from their doctors to get the shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, pharmacists’ authority to vaccinate is based on state legislators, state statutes, and state regulations,” Allison Hill, the American Pharmacists Association’s (APhA) director of professional affairs, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. “Most of those state regulations either allow pharmacists to administer [Food and Drug Administration] approved vaccines or ACIP recommended vaccines.” If healthy pregnant women are a population no longer included in the CDC’s recommendations, then pharmacy access is imperiled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next big change came in August when this year’s updated COVID shots were coming online. Vinay Prasad, a Kennedy ally and senior Food and Drug Administration (FDA) vaccine official, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/health/fda-covid-vaccines-rfk-jr.html"&gt;overruled&lt;/a&gt; agency scientists and approved the vaccines only for people over 65 or those with underlying conditions putting them at risk of severe COVID. The FDA normally determines only whether a vaccine is safe and effective, and doesn’t comment on public health recommendations for the vaccine’s deployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change effectively made administering the shot to anyone else “off label.” And because many state regulations prevent pharmacists from providing off-label shots without a prescription, the FDA’s limited approval initially resulted in &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-vaccine-complicated-after-new-fda-restrictions/story?id=125106993#:~:text=In%2041%20states,District%20of%20Columbia."&gt;barriers to access&lt;/a&gt; for healthy people in large states like Florida and New York and more than &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/cvs-pharmacy-covid-vaccine-16-states.html"&gt;a dozen&lt;/a&gt; others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access was also limited by the timing gap between the FDA’s approval and a subsequent ACIP meeting on September 18-19 to consider recommendations for the year’s updated vaccines. The prevalence of state laws relying on ACIP recommendations meant that many pharmacists could not administer the latest vaccine until the committee recommended the new shots; in 2023, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7242e1.htm#:~:text=COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20protect,and%20might%20be%20updated."&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; recommendations the day after FDA approval.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when ACIP met, its recommendation—that anyone 6 months and older consult with a provider about COVID vaccination—diverged from the FDA’s guidance. ACIP’s recommendation was broader, including healthy people that were excluded by the FDA’s approval. But the committee also added the additional step of a provider consultation for people over 65 before getting the shot whereas the FDA simply approved the vaccine for that cohort.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers are uncertain about what ACIP’s updated recommendations mean for healthy pregnant women, a group excluded by Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-medical-condition.html#:~:text=Vaccine-,Pregnancy,-Immuno%2Dcompromised%0A(excluding"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt; to the schedule in May. Jennifer Kates, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that it’s ambiguous, but her understanding of the ACIP vote is that pregnant women are included in the broad recommendation. Dorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California San Francisco whose work focuses on vaccine legal issues, told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; she doesn’t think ACIP intended to include pregnant women in its votes, noting the committee did not expressly address Kennedy’s previous changes. The chair of ACIP’s COVID working group &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/_9ChY9SpPlY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=17474"&gt;seemed to suggest&lt;/a&gt; during the meeting that the votes did not address the issue of vaccination for pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; asked the CDC to clarify whether ACIP’s COVID guidance includes healthy pregnant women. “ACIP’s recommendation applies to all individuals six months and older,” an HHS spokesperson said in response to the request for comment. “It includes an emphasis that the risk-benefit of vaccination in individuals under age 65 is most favorable for those who are at an increased risk for severe COVID-19. High-risk groups [include] those who are pregnant or recently pregnant.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the cascading uncertainty, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/"&gt;27&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/09/29/dopl-pharmacists-dont-need-prescription-covid-shot-eligible-consumers-utah/"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; have now changed regulations to safeguard vaccine access, including allowing pharmacists to administer the COVID vaccine without a prescription and re-anchoring vaccine rules to what &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32835/AAP-releases-evidence-based-immunization-schedule"&gt;medical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; recommend instead of relying on just the CDC or its vaccine advisory panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[States] are giving authority to our pharmacists to do this,” said Kates, who co-authored a recent &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/covid-19/tracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of state vaccine changes. “It’s basically, ‘Here’s our recommendation that they can give COVID vaccines to anyone ages 3 and older. Or, we are changing … our regulation or language” to align with medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AHIP, the health insurance industry’s trade association, &lt;a href="https://www.ahip.org/news/press-releases/ahip-statement-on-vaccine-coverage"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that its members would continue to cover vaccines including COVID and flu shots. The announcement came the day before the ACIP meeting, reflecting both a pointed rebuke of the committee and further fragmentation of vaccine policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people in most states should now technically be able to get the vaccine at a pharmacy. Amy Thibault, a spokeswoman for CVS, said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s pharmacies currently offer COVID vaccines to most people without a prescription in 48 states. CVS pharmacies in Georgia and Louisiana still require a prescription until the CDC formally adopts ACIP’s recommendations into the agency’s immunization schedule. Thibault added that the minimum age someone must be in order to get the vaccine at a pharmacy will vary by state rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thibault also told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; that in all 50 states pharmacists are able to fulfill the “clinical decision-making” role of a provider required for COVID vaccination; HHS also said in &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/acip-recommends-covid19-vaccination-individual-decision-making.html#:~:text=Individual%20decision%2Dmaking%20is%20referred%20to%20on%20the%20CDC%E2%80%99s%20adult%20and%20child%20immunization%20schedules%20as%20vaccination%20based%20on%20shared%20clinical%20decision%2Dmaking%2C%20which%20references%20providers%20including%20physicians%2C%20nurses%2C%20and%20pharmacists."&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; that pharmacists can serve in that role. When asked whether the new consultation requirement could create workload problems for pharmacists, she said there shouldn’t be challenges: “It’s simply a conversation between the pharmacist and patient to gauge whether the patient has any questions or concerns.” Hill, the APhA director, agreed, saying the additional burden would be marginal but adding that, “It may take a little bit longer than it used to in pharmacies because the pharmacist has to have a conversation with the patient about their overall health status, underlying conditions, and just discussion about the risk and the benefits of getting the vaccination.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the state changes, confusion and uncertainty about vaccine eligibility and access are still widespread among pharmacists, doctors, and patients alike. What has emerged on the ground is patchwork access with individual pharmacies and pharmacists coming to different conclusions about administering COVID vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are continued &lt;a href="https://truthout.org/articles/covid-vaccines-are-hard-to-get-even-in-states-that-expanded-access/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; of problems with vaccine access even in states that have adjusted their regulations and at large chain pharmacies, companies presumably best positioned to push out updated guidance to their stores. Independent pharmacy owners also are struggling to track the state and federal changes. “Each store manager is interpreting it differently and maybe each pharmacist is interpreting it differently. In the absence of standard guidance, that’s what happens,” Jennifer Avegno, the director of the New Orleans Health Department, &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-25/louisiana-pharmacies-make-their-own-rules-amid-confusing-covid-guidance-its-clear-as-mud#:~:text=Dr.%20Jennifer%20Avegno,that%E2%80%99s%20what%20happens.%E2%80%9D"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the problem is likely due to providers’ uncertainty navigating fragmentation in vaccine policy and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/well/covid-vaccines-guidelines-fall-2025.html#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20if,policies%20didn%E2%80%99t%20require."&gt;fears&lt;/a&gt; about taking actions &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-25/louisiana-pharmacies-make-their-own-rules-amid-confusing-covid-guidance-its-clear-as-mud#:~:text=COVID%20vaccines%20are,in%20doing%20this.%E2%80%9D"&gt;they feel&lt;/a&gt; could expose them to liability or risk their licenses. National emergency authorizations and authorities exercised during the pandemic meant that pharmacists didn’t have to worry about state law versus federal guidance or even insurance coverage. “The fact that states had varying policies before, that didn’t matter in the emergency,” Kates said. “Not only was the government providing free COVID vaccines, but pharmacies, and pharmacists were all protected from any liability concern and given broad emergency authority to vaccinate anyone 3 and older, which helped get people very used to going to pharmacies [for vaccines].”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond access issues, the message coming from public health authorities like ACIP is that the vaccine is not recommended as routine, and Trump administration officials and advisers have &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/robert-kennedy-senate-hearing-vaccines-cdc/"&gt;amplified&lt;/a&gt; misleading and inaccurate claims about the risks of the vaccine itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the current administration’s messaging on vaccines, the CDC had already begun moving away from recommending that providers and patients simply discuss whether to get the vaccine—a process known as shared clinical decision-making (SCDM)—because the framework created confusion for doctors and patients. For example, last June, ACIP voted to shift its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) guidance away from SCDM and to routine recommendation for specific groups. ACIP working group members noted that “[c]ompared to universal recommendations, SCDM does not have a clear call to action” and “not all providers who give vaccines are comfortable with SCDM or feel it is within their scope of practice.” They cited a 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8342675/"&gt;physician survey&lt;/a&gt; that found 76 percent of respondents thought that shared clinical decision-making creates confusion and 42 percent said they didn’t know how to implement it as intended by ACIP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Kennedy fired CDC Director Susan Monarez—the administration’s own pick who spent just a month on the job. Monarez testified to Congress that she was fired because she refused to preemptively rubber-stamp ACIP’s upcoming recommendations. Monarez was replaced by a senior Kennedy aide who’s currently serving as acting CDC director. But after the latest ACIP meeting, the panel’s updated COVID recommendations—while narrower than past guidance—are broader than the FDA’s and unlike Kennedy’s May changes to the CDC schedule, they appear to include healthy pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More uncertainty about vaccine access could follow if Kennedy decides to reject ACIP’s recommendations or issue new CDC recommendations of his own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;        
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Dispatch</author><pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 14:51:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5LVTdwVzRDTWkwZlhoaWFlMHMwY09wVl9SOEc5YjFydXg3WGo1bmFRUTA0U1VZWkZERmV1WlhpdWN6a1BuSkdiWnRsdlhTbVB0bDl1ZGNjZENvSS0wZGFyTDhDUVhTYkJEd2I3VkdydHZTcm9DQ3c</guid></item><item><title>FDA负责人表示，预计更年期症状激素治疗的“黑匣子”警告将很快发生变化- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/02/health/menopause-hrt-warning-change-makary</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The US Food and Drug Administration plans to make changes soon to the lengthy black box warning on many hormone replacement products for women with menopause symptoms, Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00042e6euz6hjv88@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are in serious discussions now about what to do about the black box warning, and I think you’ll hear something on it very soon,” Makary told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/audio/podcasts/chasing-life"&gt;Chasing Life&lt;/a&gt;” podcast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00052e6eqyl89zt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/womens-health-topics/menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause treatments&lt;/a&gt; that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warn about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00062e6eydtauwl4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The warning was added after &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195120" target="_blank"&gt;a large government-funded study&lt;/a&gt; found that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had higher risks for some kinds of cancers, heart disease and stroke compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00072e6erd0ydgwd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After the study and the label change, prescriptions for hormone replacement therapy drugs for women dropped by more than 70%, and doctors became reluctant to prescribe them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00082e6e5s5y60wx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really a tragedy.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It’s resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji00092e6ekav5ajnm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2823976?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamahealthforum.2024.3128" target="_blank"&gt;one study found&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000a2e6eeahhqn3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer analyses of the original study, called the Women’s Health Initiative, have since found that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, may safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don’t have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000b2e6eq8utzfsa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Makary also said hormone replacement therapy may also have important benefits like reducing bone loss, heart disease risk and memory loss,
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000c2e6efzlmyczo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women live longer and feel better on hormone replacement therapy when started before age 60,” Makary told Gupta.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000d2e6el3zwtay9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The potential change follows a July &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fda-expert-panels/fda-expert-panel-menopause-and-hormone-replacement-therapy-women-07172025" target="_blank"&gt;meeting of experts&lt;/a&gt;, convened by the FDA, to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000e2e6e1gf8kh7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I am begging the FDA, and all of us are begging, please remove the box label,” said Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “And please stop harming women.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000f2e6e2vb3kdk4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some women’s health experts&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;say the FDA overstepped when it applied the boxed warning to all forms of estrogen replacement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000g2e6ebps4216p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That is a real mistake,” said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the principal investigators of the Women’s Health Initiative study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000h2e6ezlo35gk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some forms don’t raise estrogen levels in the blood, so they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;aren’t likely to raise a woman’s cancer risk.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;For example, studies have found that low doses of estrogen delivered by tablets, creams or rings in the vagina can safely treat symptoms of dryness, painful sex and urinary tract infections in postmenopausal women, Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000i2e6eo8ak6a09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The black box warning, though, may stop women from using them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000j2e6ep9nps398@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It scares them away. And even after they purchase the product, they just don’t take it,” Manson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000k2e6evbrrtjuy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is really where women are being tremendously undertreated and are suffering unnecessarily due to a boxed warning that is just class labeling. All hormone therapy products get exactly the same boxed warning, and it is really harming women,” said Manson, who is chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000l2e6e9ijl6hnx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manson said it would also be reasonable for the FDA to consider removing the warnings on estrogen-containing therapies that are delivered through the skin in patches, sprays or creams to relieve the symptoms of menopause like hot flashes and night sweats. Those deliver hormones into the bloodstream, but observational studies suggest that they have a more favorable balance of risks and benefits than pills, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000m2e6ehkbfxnpm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Manson feels less certain about removing the boxed warning from estrogen-containing pills that are taken by mouth, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000n2e6e5thizgat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that’s where it’s evidence-based and justified,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000o2e6esv56zmbx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2797867" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review&lt;/a&gt; by the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that, in women who are past menopause, there was no net benefit to taking either estrogen alone – prescribed for women who’ve had their uterus removed – or a combination of estrogen and progestin – which is typically prescribed for women who still have their uterus – to prevent chronic health conditions such as heart disease and dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000p2e6e7a4xb2au@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What’s less clear is whether a woman who starts hormone therapies in perimenopause need to stay on them long-term to get memory, heart and bone benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000q2e6e33aad8en@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a very good question,” said Dr. Roberta Diaz Brinton, a neuroscientist who studies estrogen’s effects on the brain at the University of Arizona. “We need to answer that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000r2e6em089svhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other experts say there’s not enough scientific evidence to support long-term use of hormones to prevent heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease or osteoporosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000s2e6ek7txx1zv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061559" target="_blank"&gt;Four medical societies&lt;/a&gt; — the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Menopause Society, the Endocrine Society, and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology — support the use hormones to alleviate menopausal symptoms, but they don’t recommend continued use for preventing chronic conditions like heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000t2e6ew8v7t6p6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Leslie Cho, who runs Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center, said she’s supportive of the idea of lifting the warning from vaginal estrogen cream. “It’s never made sense on the cream,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000u2e6e83yb1330@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Cho said she’s worried that some of the benefits being discussed are drawn from after-the-fact analyses of studies that weren’t designed to look at those outcomes in the first place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000v2e6e30si3go3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m so glad to hear the FDA chair talk about this, because then, if that’s the case, they should do a study. They should fund a study,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000w2e6e178cjacs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a world where people can get hormones prescribed over the internet, Cho said she worries too many women could start taking hormones when they have risks like high blood pressure, obesity or high cholesterol that could overshadow the benefits. Even in younger women, studies show hormones may increase the risk of dangerous blood clots, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmg9flcji000x2e6e9nbxedog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Women have to talk to their physicians about hormone replacement therapy before they believe in all the hype that’s currently ongoing, because so much of it is hype,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;
