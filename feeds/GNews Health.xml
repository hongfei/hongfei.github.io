As of Tuesday, more than 5,000 cases had been reported. Two babies have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5759ac" class="body-graf"&gt;Canada eliminated measles in 1998. The U.S. followed two years later, in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b716d4" class="body-graf"&gt;There are multiple criteria for losing an official &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-minnesota-double-us-outbreaks-vaccine-continue-rcna235144" target="_blank"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt;, including the declines in vaccination rates observed in both countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1f6911" class="body-graf"&gt;But the most significant factor is having &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/data-investigation-childhood-vaccination-rates-are-backsliding-us-rcna228876" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing measles transmission&lt;/a&gt; for a full year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dd5a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“To really say that a country has lost the status, it takes 12 months of continuous transmission with the same genotype and the same strain of the virus,” said Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-245cd2" class="body-graf"&gt;Canada hit that mark this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f98515" class="body-graf"&gt;PAHO, which is part of the World Health Organization, is the group charged with determining whether a country in North, South or Central America has eliminated measles. It is set to convene next week in Mexico City to analyze measles data through the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f89502" class="body-graf"&gt;If a country loses its measles elimination status, “a corrective action plan will be requested to guide efforts to regain elimination,” according to a PAHO spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-79b294" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s highly unlikely that the U.S. will lose its elimination status during the upcoming meeting, Salas said, because the ongoing outbreak began in January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b234b" class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.S., at least &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,618 measles cases&lt;/a&gt; have been logged so far this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak that threatens the U.S. elimination status began in West Texas in late January. More than 800 people in Texas and New Mexico have been infected, and the outbreak has spread to other states. Three people died, including two young girls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74ec86" class="body-graf"&gt;It will take time to analyze whether ongoing spread in Arizona, Utah and South Carolina is linked to the West Texas outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-456c5f" class="body-graf"&gt;The elimination of measles in the U.S. and Canada “was a huge achievement,” Salas said. “When we say that we sustain the elimination as a region, we are also acknowledging each country for their efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5d7af7" class="body-graf"&gt;The possibility of elimination status in Canada is “a wake-up call that we need to do better in vaccinating our general public so we don’t have outbreaks like this,” Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Toronto, said in an&lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/video/2025/10/28/consequences-of-canada-losing-its-measles-free-status/" target="_blank"&gt; interview this week with CTV Television Network&lt;/a&gt; in Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cae3d5" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is extraordinarily effective, according to the CDC.

	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’ve reported on Idaho’s anti-vaccination movement for the past 10 years, most recently for ProPublica. &lt;a href="https://archive.is/p3QsN"&gt;I’ve written about&lt;/a&gt; people moving to Idaho as self-described “refugees” from states where vaccines are required for school. After the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, I wrote about Idaho’s low COVID-19 vaccination rate and, later, &lt;a href="https://idahocapitalsun.com/2021/09/17/inside-an-idaho-hospital-on-thursday-morning-a-slower-rolling-mass-casualty/"&gt;how that contributed&lt;/a&gt; to deaths and the near-collapse of our hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a journalist, the debate over vaccine policy and the rationales of the people behind the anti-vaccination movement fascinate me, even as the work comes with the weight of reporting on what can be, in some cases, life-or-death stakes. But I’m not just a journalist. I’m an Idahoan with a family, including a young child in school.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This week, I held both of those identities as I published &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;a story about Idaho becoming the first state in the nation to ban vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;. The Idaho Medical Freedom Act makes it illegal to require almost anyone to take a vaccine, test or other “medical intervention.” The law’s author, Leslie Manookian, is a finance executive turned practitioner of homeopathy who became a leader in the “health freedom” movement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-watch-leslie-manookian-and-allies-celebrate-idaho-medical-freedom-act"&gt;Watch Leslie Manookian and Allies Celebrate Idaho Medical Freedom Act&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I first heard Manookian’s name in the mid-2010s, when she was part of a group seeking to change Idaho’s school vaccination laws and rules, among other things. She went on to create the Health Freedom Defense Fund, which brought several lawsuits over vaccine and mask mandates during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. She lives in one of the few Idaho communities that wholeheartedly embraced COVID-19 precautions, and she has described feeling ostracized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our interview and follow-up calls, Manookian told me about her stance on vaccines, what she believes the role of public health should be and her longtime desire to pass the Idaho Medical Freedom Act.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the background of our conversation: a &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report"&gt;national measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; that is larger than the U.S. has seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;One big change with the Idaho Medical Freedom Act is how schools and day cares can respond if, or when, measles arrives. The law makes it illegal to send home kids who aren’t vaccinated, as long as they are “healthy.” That has important implications when it comes to measles, which can spread for days before the contagious person even realizes they’re sick.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a person who lives here, I can’t help but think about this. My family is vaccinated, but what if a student at my child’s school can’t be immunized for some reason; what will their parents do if measles begins to spread? What about my friends with kids too young to be immunized, who still need to go to day care? Does the new law keep them from choosing what they believe is best for their child?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I posed that question to an ally of Manookian’s, Mary Holland, the CEO of Children’s Health Defense, a national organization that’s become one of the fiercest foes of childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Holland said Idaho parents who want their kids to be in a learning environment with “herd immunity” levels of measles vaccination can start a private “association” — not a school, because schools can’t require vaccines — just as parents who don’t like vaccines have done in order to dodge requirements in states like California and New York.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her answer underscored how this law isn’t just about policy. It is about flipping the script on what we’ve considered the norm for generations now: that if you’re going to be part of a community, you must help protect the other people in your community. The thinking behind the Idaho Medical Freedom Act not only rejects that norm when it comes to vaccines, it makes it illegal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A week after my interview with Manookian, the duality of being a reporter covering vaccine policies and a parent of a school-aged child again came into sharp focus. I was standing outside my child’s school, chatting with the school nurse. She is in charge of many things, but in particular, knowing our school’s vaccination rates, fending off outbreaks and deciding if kids are too sick to be at school. As we talked, my phone buzzed with a call from Manookian to continue our conversation about the upcoming story.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s always my goal as a journalist to ensure accurate and fair coverage. I wanted to include Manookian’s voice because of how much influence she has over public health rules in Idaho. So I worked to faithfully describe her beliefs and how she arrived at them, but I also had a duty to spell out the wide array of scientific evidence to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our discussions, Manookian told me her driving goal is to keep people from being coerced into something they don’t believe is right, no matter what. It’s also her belief that vaccines are dangerous and that infectious diseases are beneficial. (That risk-benefit calculus is not supported by the overwhelming body of evidence, not even by studies the movement relies on.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an Idahoan, I pay close attention to what’s happening around me, so that I can make informed decisions. As a journalist, it’s my job to help readers understand the thinking behind changes to public policy and where those ideas come from.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As I reported this week, Manookian doesn’t just have her eyes on Idaho. She intends to take this law to other states and believes it can be a model for the country. I’ll have my eyes on that, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can read my full story, which includes my interview with Manookian, for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/idaho-vaccine-bill-medical-freedom-act-maha"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

If the female does not give this subtle, but crucial, signal, the male’s efforts fail, and copulation does not occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mosquito sex lasts only a few seconds, and usually occurs in mid-air. These factors, combined with the minute size of the genitals, have made it difficult to study exactly what’s going on, Vosshall says, adding that the scientists who previously studied mosquito breeding probably just shrugged and said, “Yeah, the male is in charge.” Her team’s findings, which could have implications for controlling disease-carrying mosquitoes, were published today in the journal &lt;i&gt;Current Biology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fluorescent sperm&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the intricate mating process of &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; — the main species of mosquito that transmits dengue — Vosshall and colleagues first engineered transgenic males that produce either green or red fluorescent sperm. Then they put some of each type into a cage with females of the same species for seven days. When the females were dissected at the end of that period, more than 90% of them had sperm of only one colour stored in their bodies, supporting the idea that they mate only once in their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second set of experiments, the team filmed the mating process using an elaborate set-up. The researchers glued a female mosquito to a metal pin, so that she could move her wings and legs but not fly away, like a trapeze artist in a rigid tether. They then introduced free-flying males into the cage, and recorded the interactions between the male and female genitals at high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03535-1/d41586-025-03535-1_51622442.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03535-1/d41586-025-03535-1_51622442.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A black and white microscopy photograph of the external genitalia of male mosquito, with the gonostyli in an 'X' shape." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03535-1/d41586-025-03535-1_51622442.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Male &lt;i&gt;Aedes&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes use drumstick-like genital structures called gonostyli (shown here, crossed) to tap on the genitalia of females when initiating sex.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: H. Amalia Pasolli, Anurag Sharma/The Rockefeller University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leah Houri-Zeevi, a researcher in Vosshall’s lab, spent hundreds of hours looking at the videos, frame by frame. She noticed that when a male is trying to copulate, he doesn’t simply extend his sex organ — the equivalent of a penis — towards the female. Instead, he first taps the female genitalia with drumstick-like structures called gonostyli. In response to the tapping, a virgin female might elongate the tip of her genitalia, to enable copulation. Houri-Zeevi noticed that non-virgin females, however, typically kept their genitals retracted, blocking further mating attempts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

studies claim that a number of things happen to your body in a 36-hour fasting period, with the video in question saying your body undergoes some 'incredible transformations'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;At this stage, digestion shuts down and insulin drops fast, meaning that your body starts to burn stored glucose for energy, instead of breaking down incoming carbohydrates into glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Your blood sugar levels will start to dip around this point, with your system beginning to 'dig into its backup reserves', using glycogen, another form of stored glucose, for energy, with functionality getting slightly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The simulation suggests that 'the real transformation begins' at this point, as your body starts to burn fat as insulin hits rock-bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Your body then enters ketosis, according to the video, meaning your body becomes a 'fatmelting furnace', producing and using ketone bodies to turn fat into fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Healthline notes that this process can result in decreased appetite and weight loss, as well as fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Described as 'your body's built-in detox mode', autophagy starts to take effect as your body begins to recycle and break down damaged cells, flushing out waste as it repairs you 'from the inside out'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Your body will start to consume its own tissue this way, as Cleveland Clinic &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24058-autophagy"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; that the process includes getting rid of nonfunctional cell parts and removing bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They add: "Autophagy isn’t a clear-cut harmful or beneficial process concerning disease prevention or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"There’s not enough research to support inducing autophagy as a wellness strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Cleveland Clinic advises you to reach out to a professional if you're considering any lifestyle changes which could be detrimental to your bodily processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Your body carries out a number of biological processes (YouTube/The Limitless Emperor)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;This is where 'cellular repair' speeds up, according to the video - meaning that the body starts burning pure fat, with all the cells in the body working overtime in what is also known as a 'deep repair'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Inflammation in the body also decreases as sensitivity to insulin improves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;At this point, the video claims, growth hormone skyrockets, which could help to protect muscles and boost recovery from exercise or workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;36 hours&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;After a day and a half, it's claimed that the body will hit peak autophagy, with dead cells discarded and tissues regenerating efficiently while the metabolism starts to 'fire on all cylinder' in what the simulation describes as a 'full body reset'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the end&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's vital to remember that health experts urged those considering fasting diets of any sort to consult a medical professional beforehand, to avoid any issues or complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Healthline writes: "Fasting always has medical impacts and should not be taken lightly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It goes on to advise you to talk to a professional before trying intermittent fasting - and adds that prolonged fasting should always be medically supervised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 17:03:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxPWmRwSmxRN1FMN2taZzZiUkxMNThYNE5tUnV6WElzWEpuWGpKMmN6ZEI0NUpUSFZCM0VkclhHUWJQZm45SHZ2Ykoyb3FaZVlFVm4yMEZoeFRxUlVVVU85WEN0YkM3TVJtcm1qR2JacUhKVWZMTTQ3SEV1QnU5aEFtU05iX3dOWm9rdDFKSlFqSjQ1TnJQdXNteA</guid></item><item><title>根据培训师的说法， 6种力量锻炼可以在45岁后比有氧运动更快地对抗衰老-吃这个不是那个</title><link>https://www.eatthis.com/6-best-strength-exercises-after-45/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
													
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Once you hit 45, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/strength-workouts-to-look-younger/" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; becomes one of the best things you can do for long-term health and wellness. While many tend to focus on cardio or general physical activity, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/resistance-band-exercises-burn-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;resistance training&lt;/a&gt; is what keeps you “strong, mobile, and independent” with age, says &lt;b&gt;Clif Marshall&lt;/b&gt;, senior director of coaching and pro training at&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.d1training.com/" target="_blank"&gt; D1 Training&lt;/a&gt;. So, we’ve rounded up the best &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/essential-strength-exercises-trainers-recommend/" target="_blank"&gt;strength exercises&lt;/a&gt; to start this week after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s why strength training&lt;i&gt; really&lt;/i&gt; matters after 45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Once we reach our mid-40s, the body naturally begins to lose muscle mass and strength, which happens faster if someone remains inactive,” Marshall explains. “Muscles are metabolically active tissue, meaning they help regulate blood sugar, support hormone balance, and maintain a healthy metabolism. When muscle declines, metabolism slows, and it becomes easier to gain body fat even if your diet and activity levels stay the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, bone density declines, but resistance workouts place “healthy stress” on the bones, promoting new growth while decreasing the risk of injury and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Your muscles do not have eyes, so any form of resistance can work for strength training, including bodyweight, resistance bands, dumbbells, kettlebells or barbells,” Marshall tells us. “In short, strength training is one of the best ways to fight aging from the inside out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.instagram.com/juliedsoul/#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;J&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ulie Dermer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, longtime master instructor at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.soul-cycle.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SoulCycle&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle influencer, and leader in the fitness space, compares lifting weights—or training with just your body weight—to hitting the “refresh” button on your entire system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It keeps muscle on your frame, bones strong, metabolism fired up, and confidence high. Plus, it’s not just about how you look, it’s about moving with power and ease in every part of your life,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6 Strength Exercises That Fight Aging After 45&lt;/h2&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bodyweight Squats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l83R5PblSMA?si=xViGaLuaDezPW87T" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bodyweight &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-many-squats-to-see-results-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;squat&lt;/a&gt; is a classic strength move that fires up the legs, glutes, and core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This exercise builds lower-body strength and mobility, helping prevent falls and knee or hip issues,” Marshall says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin the exercise by standing tall with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your arms in front of you or place your hands on your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend at the knees and hips as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to descend until your thighs are parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to return to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pushups&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDIpL0pjun0?si=_qWJprSBhw2HOEK-" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushups engage the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core, making them one of the most efficient bodyweight moves you can weave into your routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This exercise strengthens the upper body and improves shoulder stability and posture,” Marshall explains, noting to keep your body straight as you lower and press back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a high plank position with your hands under your shoulders and your body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows and lower your chest toward the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a long, straight body as you lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back up, straightening your arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Glute Bridges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xp33YgPZgns?si=xynVl2XUZHhrFHro" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glute bridge fires up your glutes, hamstrings, and lower back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move supports lower-back health and hip strength, which supports the development of balance and pain-free movement,” Marshall notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back with bent knees and feet hip-width apart on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to lift your hips until your body forms a straight line from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your buttocks, holding at the top for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your hips back to the start position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform glute bridges for 3 sets of 15 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Plank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B296mZDhrP4?si=h9m56rs6qoDsCoyk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/plank-variations-for-six-pack/" target="_blank"&gt;plank&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent test of core strength. This move engages the core, shoulders, and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Planks build core endurance, which supports posture and reduces the risk of back pain,” Marshall says, noting to keep your body straight while maintaining a tight core throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place your hands under your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press into the pads of your fingers and hug your inner arm toward your armpit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk your feet out to hip-width.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your abs, squeeze your buttocks, and pull upward through your quads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 20 to 45-second holds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 class="o-slide-title" data-num="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bent-Over Rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gvmcqr226U?si=aj-PirKmjMTIxdmR" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bent-over rows activate the shoulders, biceps, and mid-to-upper back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This move strengthens the back and counteracts the forward posture common with aging and desk work,” Marshall says, stressing to pull the weights toward your ribcage, squeezing your shoulder blades together, and slowly lowering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet hip-width apart and a dumbbell in each hand in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hinge at the hips until your torso is parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain a flat back and soft knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow the weights to lower with your arms completely extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Row the dumbbells up toward your torso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower to the start position with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step-ups are a simple move that targets the core, glutes, and legs.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This exercise improves leg strength, balance, and coordination – important for preventing falls,” Marshall explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall, feet parallel and hip-distance apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring your hands to your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step one foot forward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage your core as you bend your knees, lowering to form 90-degree bends in both legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your upper body straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your front heel and the ball of your back foot to rise back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform 3 sets of 10 reps on each leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t panic. If you discover your child is itchy and has pinworms symptoms, this is what you can expect.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:57am &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Number one, out of sheer humiliation and panic this article is being submitted anonymously. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Number two,  BCP says they’re the big sister we all need, so of course, at 12:26 a.m. I type “pinworms” into their search bar fully confident they’ll walk me through this one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: I’m met with nothing remotely helpful enough! One post that comes up in the search lets me know &lt;a href="https://betweencarpools.com/what-to-stock-in-your-medicine-cabinet/"&gt;what I should stock in my medicine cabinet&lt;/a&gt; – including one pinworm medication recommendation that I don’t have on hand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-prata-font-family"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;mark class="has-inline-color"&gt;But I needed more tips.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, I’m going to journal my family’s struggle with this nuisance and share what I can with you. Please, fellow moms, help me by leaving comments below in regards to what has helped for you. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In my limited Googling at 1 a.m., I discovered that pinworms are pretty common in children, especially girls. It’s extremely catchy. Important preventative measures include keeping nails short and clean as much as possible, and washing hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and before eating. For context, I pride myself in being a clean and efficient balabusta. We wash our linen weekly, shower nightly, and change towels daily. We also cut nails every Friday. So I’m feeling pretty despondent and a little grossed out. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most effective and common treatment seems to be &lt;a href="https://betweencarpools.com/what-to-stock-in-your-medicine-cabinet/"&gt;Reese’s PinX – and like BCP shared in this post&lt;/a&gt;, and as they noted, it would be wise to keep a bottle at home because pinworms tend to reveal themselves during the night. See? Between Carpools WAS being a good &lt;a href="https://betweencarpools.com/the-6-feminine-products-only-a-big-sister-will-tell-you-about/"&gt;big sister&lt;/a&gt;. I just feel like we can have a longer conversation about this! (A friend later tells me &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/4qAL2kK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;PinRid&lt;/a&gt; has a much better flavor and comes in chewable form.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also read that it might be wise to treat the whole family at this point since pinworms are highly contagious. I also read that some pediatricians recommend taking the dose again in two weeks to prevent further infestation. But now let’s continue and see what my doctor said in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did I know that my child has pinworms? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Note that pinworms can also occur in adults. My friend had pinworms post-birth and her Dr. said it sometimes gets picked up after a hospital stay.) &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically the patient will wake up during the night with extreme itchiness. If you shine a flashlight to the itchy spot, it’s likely you will see a worm (or worms) crawling out of the vaginal or anal areas (or both). Do not panic–that will not help. If you have the medicine at home, you’re lucky. We didn’t since this is our first rodeo. I did not tell my precious princess that she has pinworms; she’s 7 and I don’t see how that’s helpful information for her to have at 1 a.m. Or ever. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After trying to hold her hands while laying next to her, I see she’s really suffering and I give her a MeloChew (use at your own discretion) and a dose of Benadryl. This stops the itching and helps her fall asleep within the next few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ok, she’s asleep, maybe I get some sleep too? Mind over matter. I can forget the visual of that worm for now–can’t I?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:08 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hi Dr. Roth ? My daughter has pinworms–help!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medication is delivered within the hour and my daughter takes her first dose right away. The nurse said to give her a second dose in 7-10 days. She doesn’t think we need to treat the whole family at this point. I’m not sure how I feel about that. Seeing as I laid in her bed last night, I’ll definitely be taking the over-the-counter dose. I think her brother who’s closest to her age will be taking it too. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I stripped everyone’s linen to reduce the risk of any stray eggs working their dark magic again. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:30 a.m. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m so grateful we got through this with only one night of drama. I’m so grateful my daughter slept the night. In the last two days I learned that high sugar intake increases the likelihood of pinworms since they feed on it. It seems that pinworms live in the intestines and a known natural remedy is garlic which can be taken in vitamin or suppository form. I welcome any feedback from moms who’ve tried that or anything else that has helped. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We now keep &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/43FmQn4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;PinRid&lt;/a&gt; on hand. Somehow I feel like if we have it, we won’t need it. We survived this right of passage.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet, there’s another blood test that might actually out‑shine cholesterol, in flagging your risk - the high‑sensitivity CRP (hs‑CRP) test, which measures a protein that signals inflammation throughout the body. This marker can expose hazards that a plain cholesterol reading would miss. Dr Dmitry Yaranov, MD, and a Cardiologist reveals why the CRP test is so important to rule out future heart attacks...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What is CRP and how does it predict heart attacks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRP stands for C-reactive protein, which your liver produces when there is inflammation in your body. Inflammation is your body’s natural response to injury or infection, but when it becomes chronic, it can damage your arteries, says Dr Yaranov. Damaged arteries are more likely to develop plaques that block blood flow or rupture, causing heart attacks or strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What are the most common tests used to diagnose heart conditions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high‑sensitivity CRP (hs‑CRP) blood test pinpoints trace amounts of C‑reactive protein, with immense accuracy. Research shows that individuals with elevated hs‑CRP face up to triple the chance of a heart attack, than those whose levels, even when their cholesterol numbers appear normal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results underscore that inflammation, and not just cholesterol is a pivotal driver of heart‑disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Yaranov, the test outcomes are grouped as...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Low risk – anything, under 1.0 mg/L&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Moderate risk – 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High risk: above 3.0 mg/L&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why cholesterol alone doesn’t tell the story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although cholesterol remains a piece of the heart‑disease puzzle, it certainly doesn’t explain every case. Plenty of people, with normal cholesterol levels still suffer heart attacks, while some, with high cholesterol never experience one. CRP reveals the level of inflammation that can make plaques in your arteries unstable and dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaque buildup alone isn’t enough to cause a heart attack-when the plaques become inflamed, they can rupture suddenly. This rupture prompts blood clots that block arteries. An elevated CRP reading, signals the sign of lingering inflammation, and a fragile plaque - something a plain cholesterol panel could overlook. Using cholesterol tests together with the hs-CRP test, gives doctors a fuller picture of your heart health, helping guide more accurate prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How ongoing inflammation chips away at your heart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inflamed arterial wall tips the balance toward a plaque rupture-the kind of event that can trigger a heart attack or stroke in an instant. In parallel, the same lingering inflammation is linked to peripheral artery disease (PAD), a condition that narrows leg arteries, bringing aching discomfort and curbing mobility. By quantifying C‑reactive protein, clinicians can spot this inflammation well before a cardiac episode emerges, opening the door to prompt targeted intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Using the hs-CRP test alongside other markers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors however, do not pass a diagnosis, based on just CRP, they usually weigh it together with cholesterol readings, the Lp(a) variant, blood pressure, smoking status and a host of risk factors. This combination helps identify people at moderate risk who might benefit from preventive treatments, even if their cholesterol is normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple investigations have shown that tacking a high‑sensitivity C‑reactive protein (hs‑CRP) measurement onto the risk‑assessment toolkit, sharpens the ability to predict who will go on to have a heart attack or a stroke. It also flags the patients most likely to reap the benefit from statin therapy, which pulls down both cholesterol and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to naturally reduce CRP Levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Embrace a diet full of whole plant‑forward staples-fruits, vegetables, hearty whole grains, crunchy nuts and protein‑packed legumes, since they deliver a mix of antioxidants and anti‑inflammatory nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Keep your body moving. Even a simple 30‑minute walk each day, can help calm inflammation and bring your CRP down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Drop the cigarettes – smoking is the one of the leading causes of heart disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Reduce stress, as persistent stress can trigger inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Medication options to reduce CRP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In situations where simply tweaking one’s habits isn’t sufficient, physicians often turn to statins, which not trim cholesterol, but also exert effects that bring CRP down. Newer medications, specifically targeting inflammation are also being studied for cardiovascular protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your hs‑CRP comes back elevated, sit down with your doctor. Map out the treatment plan that fits you best. Keeping up with follow‑up labs lets you and your clinician see how things are progressing, and tweak the regimen when needed. Remember that reducing CRP is part of a comprehensive approach to reduce your overall heart attack and stroke risk. If you harbor risk factors such, as a family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure or borderline cholesterol, an hs‑CRP test might prove advantageous. It can expose a concealed threat that routine examinations often miss. Getting your hs‑CRP result often sparks the initiative to embrace heart‑healthy habits, and gives your doctor the data needed to tailor your care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgJBVV95cUxQbEk5WElhUXlmakgxTDBqLS1QMmV3d1U5WWljZkVVclIzSXI0NjMxQ0U4cDNhX2M2aTlJLS1KWnRMV2tGSDIyeVgtTUlOMGhQU3JpZ2NpLW9TVzNTa1FlS01STktDZjlxTlczU01wMlRSUkRkdVhHRnZycy13T3lDeUE0NXg5WGdhSDR2ZmFLV3R3cGRsNXRncVFmQWM4NGhJeUY3dWJLVDFtQ1liLUpETG9YT0xQQ2NoR3Q3TWNrUHZVcl9YWTdPeHd0aGVHbnhwaV84akJFRVNPZXBhSFpST19kS1VmdVAzUmZqV2pJekJrV0swSEZrdTJBZWZLQktTYTNiUEt5WHdRTXIwdzJNYUt1ZkNtT1F2WkRHU2J4Mk5ZNzJBbkJTVWJB</guid></item><item><title>什么是蛋白质水–它能帮助我减肥和增加肌肉吗？ |抗病毒-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/29/protein-water-uses-benefits-downside-health-weight-loss-muscle-gain</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Having infiltrated products ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DICEKT0uHnw/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chips to pancakes&lt;/a&gt;, protein is now being marketed as a healthy addition to … water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Influencers on TikTok and Instagram have been paid to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/proteinwater?lang=en" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;promote protein water sachets and premade drinks&lt;/a&gt;, praising the confectionery-like flavours for helping them meet their “protein goals”.

For someone who was struggling to get protein in, because they might have an illness, for example, this may be useful. But if you don’t need it, your body just stores it as fat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This counteracts the claims on some protein drinks that the products help with weight loss and building lean muscle mass, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="weight-loss-claims-misleading" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Weight-loss claims ‘misleading’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Danielle Shine, a PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation on social media and an accredited dietitian and nutritionist, says positioning protein waters as effective weight-loss aids is misleading, especially when compared with whole-food sources of protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="344b4781-4437-4e4a-97c8-a20ea079ff9a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Pregnancy skincare products target women at a vulnerable time.

ROACH: I am a 68-year-old woman who is in relatively good health. My primary exercise is walking my dogs anywhere from 2-5 miles per day. I have two Morton’s neuromas in my left foot, and I’ve been receiving shots for them for at least the past eight to ten years, with the shots being more frequent in recent times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I2RIEJJMZFFVTHX5JXP5LHU5AU"&gt;Sadly, these shots have diminishing returns and no longer eliminate the pain and discomfort. I wear the appropriate footwear and use metatarsal pads in every left shoe that I own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVUJRL7QE5GXNJSXEBFYZHSTHQ"&gt;I am considering surgery to remove the pinched nerves. Can you discuss the pros and cons of this surgery along with the recovery process? My expectation with surgery is to be able to walk pain-free. (Even if I never wear heels again!) My podiatrist explained that I will have permanent resultant numbness in certain toes post-op. -- T.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="M62VE2LL6BEQFCHRRMZ3BSRJD4"&gt;ANSWER: A Morton’s neuroma is a thickening of the nerve in between the toes, usually on one side of the third or fourth toes. You have tried the appropriate conservative therapy with proper footwear and pads to take pressure off the enlarged nerve. Your podiatrist then appropriately tried second-line treatment with injections, but since the injections are no longer working, I agree that consideration of surgery is appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QLM4D2TCWRCOFPSBIKPOG6WUIQ"&gt;There are at least two common surgeries for the treatment of a Morton’s neuroma that does not respond to more conservative treatment. The most optimistic studies of these surgeries found a 96% to 97% reduction in pain during daily activities. Other studies have shown less optimistic results, with only 50% of people reporting their results as excellent, 30% reporting good results, and 10% reporting poor or very poor results. About 63% were pain-free during their follow-ups in one large study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XTOFSQJX6JE4HO2V3GUTP3H2VU"&gt;As I have not had a patient undergo this surgery, I can’t tell you my personal experience, but based on the published literature, I would tell you that good results are likely but by no means guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="A667IRLM35HO7MNC5LKYE4SICA"&gt;The literature also reports that most people can walk after surgery immediately or within a few days, then transition to regular shoes within two to four weeks. Most people do not find the numbness after surgery to be too bothersome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I’ve been having some eye symptoms, including blurry vision and needing brighter light when reading at night. I have noticed that my night vision is not good, and my distance vision is not as sharp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SHJIFY4XZNBM5AXJH72PC4AITU"&gt;I saw an ad for a supplement, which included vitamins A and C, copper and biotin, and lutein and zeaxanthin. Now I’m having second thoughts because it is sounding too good to be true. What do you think of this type of supplement? -- R.Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRQJWOZIMJDF5O6UK4BKNAITNQ"&gt;ANSWER: This formula sounds similar to (but not exactly the same as) the AREDS2 supplement, which was proven to slow the progression of age-related macular degeneration. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that these supplements, alone or together, are likely to improve your vision symptoms if you don’t have diagnosed macular degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FXSL3MOCG5FJPJIKUPRWIVC7FI"&gt;As always, look for the statement on the label that says: “Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Adminstration and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease or health condition.” To me, the advertising sounds like it is in direct conflict with the disclaimer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7Y62N5WPQJA6DOVILB2GPKSZU4"&gt;If you are diagnosed with macular degeneration, you need to find out from your ophthalmologist whether a supplement like AREDS2 is right for you. It can be purchased exactly as it was published in the studies. (One brand is PreserVision, but there are others.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-13" data-gaid="inarticle-13"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="F7LQ22LTV5DZDFYDQUZULAW55Y"&gt;However, your symptoms are concerning, and I don’t think you should just buy a supplement. You should have a comprehensive eye exam if you haven’t had one very recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-14" data-gaid="inarticle-14"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GA7ELA3LDJC35LLZXRCAXNIQ3E"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dr. Roach regrets that he is unable to answer individual letters, but will incorporate them in the column whenever possible.

		&lt;p&gt;Noise is the wallpaper of modern life. It’s there when you wake, when you work, when you try to fall asleep. Most of it is harmless in isolation, yet together it becomes something else: a steady press on your nervous system, a kind of invisible weather. You don’t notice how tense your shoulders are until a door slams. You don’t realise how shallow your breathing has become until the room goes quiet. This is the hidden risk of everyday noise — not the single blast, but the drip, drip, drip of sound stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus sighed past my window at 6:41 a.m., tyres whispering on wet tarmac. Someone upstairs dropped a spoon and laughed, a kettle clicked on, a phone vibrated somewhere with that needy bee-hum. I watched the steam rise and felt my heart drumming harder than the moment deserved. A scooter buzzed the lights. The fridge hummed like a thought I couldn’t put down. It wasn’t loud, not exactly. But it stacked. We’ve all had that moment when the small sounds add up to a big feeling. Then the kettle screamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The quiet crisis in our ears&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordinary noise doesn’t feel like danger, yet your body doesn’t ask nicely. It reacts. The rustle of traffic, the ping of a message, the neighbour’s subwoofer at lunchtime — these layers prime the stress system to stay on. Muscles clench, cortisol nudges higher, attention frays by noon. You reach for coffee and headphones and call it coping. &lt;strong&gt;Noise doesn’t only live in your ears; it lives in your nervous system.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not dramatic. It’s cumulative. A background bias toward alertness that steals bandwidth you thought you still had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask Maria, who works from a flat by the ring road. Her smartwatch shows a higher resting heart rate on weekdays and better sleep on the few nights traffic is lighter. That tracks with public-health data: long-term environmental noise has been tied to higher risks of heart disease and anxiety, especially when night-time noise breaks slumber. A normal conversation sits around 60 dB. A vacuum cleaner lives near 70 dB. A blender can spike to 90 dB. Because decibels are logarithmic, a 10 dB jump roughly feels twice as loud. Small shifts matter. So do the hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s really going on. Your brain is a prediction machine. Sounds that are unpredictable or that you can’t control keep it scanning for what’s next. That scanning has a cost. It soaks up attention, feeds a low simmer of fight-or-flight, and heightens pain and irritability. Stress loves company, so fatigue and noise egg each other on. Open-plan offices, busy streets, the endless digital chorus — each adds a few points of strain. Headphones help, but they can also mask the issue if you simply add more sound on top of sound. Quiet isn’t silence. It’s certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What actually helps, today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of a sound diet. You need some, you want some, and you benefit from choosing what, when, and how much. Start with three levers: intensity, duration, and meaning. Lower intensity at the source: shut doors softly, put felt pads under chair legs, add a rug. Trim duration by creating a few “quiet slots” — 10 minutes without audio before your first caffeine, 5 minutes after lunch to breathe with longer exhales, one hour device-free before bed. Change the meaning by labelling a noise (“that’s the 7:10 bus, it passes”) which can dial down the body’s threat meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common traps are understandable. Cranking white noise too loud to drown a busy street, wearing earplugs all day until normal sounds feel jarring, or blasting music to concentrate. Instead, keep white or brown noise low, just below speech level, and use it like a dimmer, not a wall. Alternate earplugs with “open” time to keep your system flexible. Use noise-cancelling on trains, then flip to ambient mode when walking. Set “sound boundaries” at home: music on speakers between set hours, headphones afterward. Let’s be honest: nobody does that every day. Try it most days and you’ll still feel the shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also the gentler layer: how your body receives sound. Slow breathing with longer exhales signals safety. So does warmth, literally a cup of tea cupped in both hands. A short body scan can reduce the “noise of noise” by quieting the brain’s alarm. It’s like a fingertip to the temple. You’re not trying to win silence. You’re trying to turn down the “threat” knob while the world keeps moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quiet is not the absence of sound, it’s the presence of safety.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce at source: soft close, soft surfaces, soft voices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase distance: move the speaker, move your chair, close a door.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add absorption: curtains, rugs, bookshelves break up echo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage timing: create daily quiet slots like meetings with yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset your body: longer exhale breathing, stretch, step outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect kindly: use earplugs and ANC in bursts, not all day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A gentler way to hear the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason a quiet library feels medicinal and a Sunday morning city can feel like a hug. When sound gets predictable and soft, your nervous system stands down and gives you back your focus. You can’t change the traffic or teach next door to levitate. You can change the way your day handles sound, the way your space absorbs it, the way your body interprets it. It’s small, almost boring, which is why it works. Tidy one corner of your soundscape and the rest starts to follow. Share a quiet coffee. Walk without earbuds. Leave one window for birdsong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Everyday noise acts like a micro-stressor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Unpredictable, uncontrollable sounds keep the brain on alert, raising stress load and draining focus over time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Explains why you feel tired, edgy, or unfocused even on “quiet” days&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Small changes compound into relief&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Lower intensity, shorten duration, and shift meaning with simple tweaks at home and work&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quick wins you can try today without buying fancy gear&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Protect ears without overprotecting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Use earplugs and noise-cancelling in bursts, keep white noise low, mix in true quiet time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Stay comfortable now and resilient later, avoiding sensitivity rebound&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What counts as “too loud” at home?&lt;/strong&gt;Conversation is roughly 60 dB. If you need to raise your voice to speak at arm’s length, it’s likely above 70 dB and worth reducing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can everyday noise really make me ill?&lt;/strong&gt;Long-term exposure has been linked to higher stress, poor sleep, and increased cardiovascular risk. The mix of loudness, duration, and timing matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is white noise safe for sleep?&lt;/strong&gt;Keep it low, steady, and simple. Aim just below speech level and avoid harsh, high-pitched hiss. Brown or pink noise can feel softer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are noise-cancelling headphones okay all day?&lt;/strong&gt;Great in bursts for travel or focus. Alternate with ambient mode or silent breaks so your ears and brain stay adaptable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I talk to a noisy neighbour without a row?&lt;/strong&gt;Pick a calm time, describe one clear impact (“the bass carries into our bedroom at 11”), and suggest a fix (“could we keep bass lower after 10?”). Offer reciprocity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When this gene was mutated, subjects were slower to avoid alcohol and consumed more of it, showing reduced sensitivity to its calming effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation also altered brain signaling pathways involving glutamate and GABA, both crucial for balancing excitation and inhibition. These findings suggest that variations in CHRNA3 could increase vulnerability to alcohol dependence, providing new insight into genetic risk factors for addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol Sensitivity Gene:&lt;/strong&gt; CHRNA3 regulates how strongly the brain responds to alcohol’s effects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutation Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Altered CHRNA3 delays alcohol avoidance and promotes higher intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addiction Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; The gene’s function may underlie genetic predispositions to alcohol use disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS Medicine) report that the gene, CHRNA3, acts as a key regulator of alcohol sensitivity. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, the study provides long-sought experimental evidence to back up human genetic studies, linking CHRNA3 function changes to measurable differences in innate alcohol sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture decoding="async" class="wp-image-113595"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a man and a glass of whiskey." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/alcohol-addiction-gene-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;By linking the chrna3 gene to measurable behavioural and brain changes, this study strengthens the biological understanding of addiction risk and offers insights into genetic predisposition to alcohol dependence. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Associate Professor Ajay S. Mathuru from the Department of Physiology at NUS Medicine with first author, Dr. Joshua Raine, Research Fellow, and Dr. Caroline Kibat, Senior Research Fellow, from the same department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that mutations in the gene chrna3, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene expressed in the nervous system, are associated with lowered sensitivity to alcohol in a preclinical laboratory model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine if genetic factors can contribute to developing alcohol use disorders, the researchers utilised a two-choice assay where it is possible to self-administer alcohol voluntarily. They quantified avoidance versus attraction behaviour and analysed brain gene expression for key neurotransmitter receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In normal conditions, brief attraction to alcohol followed by rapid avoidance as the dose rises, was observed. In contrast, preclinical laboratory models with mutations in chrna3 delay this switch to avoidance, self-administering alcohol for much longer and tolerating higher concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation was associated with altered brain expression of glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor genes, which regulate excitatory and inhibitory signalling respectively, and reduced alcohol’s typical effects on behaviour by weakening the calming effect at low doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate that normal chrna3 function helped control alcohol exposure and may underlie individual differences in alcohol sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By linking the chrna3 gene to measurable behavioural and brain changes, this study strengthens the biological understanding of addiction risk and offers insights into genetic predisposition to alcohol dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study provides direct experimental evidence that chrna3 regulates alcohol sensitivity,” said Assoc Prof Mathuru.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Variants altering this gene’s function may increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorders in humans, a possibility that needs further investigation. Finding such risk factors can help develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assoc Prof Mathuru is a Joint Principal Investigator at Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR. He holds appointments with N.1 Institute for Health at NUS, the Institute of Digital Medicine (WisDM), and the Healthy Longevity Translational Research Programme at NUS Medicine. Collaborators of the study include Professor Antónia Monteiro and Dr Tirtha Das Banerjee from the Department of Biological Sciences at NUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The refined self-administration assay used in this study provides a cost-effective technique with faster turn-around times to uncover how specific genes modulate addiction-associated behaviours. It can complement other approaches to improve efficiency and guide future targeted therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this work, the team aims to analyse CHRNA3 variants in humans for similar alcohol sensitivity. They have extended their research to map reward and avoidance circuits and to dissect interactions using single and combined mutations in CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster linked to substance addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s future work aims to uncover mechanistic links across neurotransmitter systems altered in these mutants, assess impacts on other behaviours, and examine relevance to co-occurring human conditions – informing personalised preventive strategies for individuals with such genetic predispositions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and addiction research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5e39323f3a272d2d37331e302b2d703b3a2b702d39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Gladys Sim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nus.edu.sg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NUS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Gladys Sim – NUS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0304-25.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;chrna3&lt;/em&gt; Modulates Alcohol Response&lt;/a&gt;” by Ajay S.

New methods to understand the underlying neurogenetics are valuable for designing personalized interventional strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we used a two-choice self-administration zebrafish assay to isolate the function of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha3 (&lt;em&gt;chrna3&lt;/em&gt;) in alcohol response. Juvenile zebrafish, of either sex, prior to complete sex differentiation, were examined in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They exhibited a biphasic response when self-administering alcohol that transitioned from attraction to aversion within minutes, suggesting they can regulate exposure to alcohol. This inverted U-shaped self-administration mirrored the effect alcohol has on shoaling behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to low concentration of alcohol reduced anxiety-like behaviors, while sedative effects became prominent at higher concentrations resulting in reduced locomotion and uncoordinated swimming. In contrast, these responses are blunted in &lt;em&gt;chrna3&lt;/em&gt; mutants. They exhibited prolonged alcohol self-administration and increased gregariousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomic analyses suggest that glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission alongside cholinergic signaling is impacted in the mutant brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results thus suggest that &lt;em&gt;chrna3&lt;/em&gt; dysfunction has a systemic change with an increase in alcohol tolerance being one effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings also highlight the use of nonrodent alternatives to understand the neurogenetics of development of AUD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 12:31:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBkZy1lREZ5TWN4NE9KRExjNjN1OWwzNk5SdlVtUU5rQVJxU3dwSjZvdDBJdm9OMlBzeU52dmc4Z2VCd3huU3duRUxZbWo0SWpDS3V6MmJJbm05cG01OHVGSWxOUjZLQ2M</guid></item><item><title>为什么你可以打捞发霉的奶酪，但从不腐烂的肉-毒理学家建议要注意什么-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/why-you-can-salvage-moldy-cheese-but-never-spoiled-meat-a-toxicologist-advises-on-what-to-watch-out-for-263908</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When you open the refrigerator and find a wedge of cheese flecked with green mold, or a package of chicken that smells faintly sour, it can be tempting to gamble with your stomach rather than waste food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the line between harmless fermentation and dangerous spoilage is sharp. Consuming spoiled foods exposes the body to a range of microbial toxins and biochemical by-products, many of which can interfere with essential biological processes. The health effects can vary from mild gastrointestinal discomfort to severe conditions such as liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a &lt;a href="https://www.engr.colostate.edu/cbe/people/brad-reisfeld/"&gt;toxicologist and researcher&lt;/a&gt; specializing in how foreign chemicals such as those released during food spoilage affect the body. Many spoiled foods contain specific microorganisms that produce toxins. Because individual sensitivity to these chemicals varies, and the amount present in spoiled foods can also vary widely, there are no absolute guidelines on what is safe to eat. However, it’s always a good idea to know your enemies so you can take steps to avoid them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nuts and grains&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In plant-based foods such as grains and nuts, fungi are the main culprits behind spoilage, forming fuzzy patches of mold in shades of green, yellow, black or white that usually give off a musty smell. Colorful though they may be, many of these molds produce toxic chemicals called mycotoxins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two common fungi found on grains and nuts such as &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/83271/download"&gt;corn, sorghum, rice and peanuts&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A. parasiticus&lt;/em&gt;. They can produce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins14050307"&gt;mycotoxins known as aflatoxins&lt;/a&gt;, which form molecules called epoxides that can trigger mutations when they bind to DNA. Repeated exposure to aflatoxins &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mycotoxins"&gt;can damage the liver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.14252/foodsafetyfscj.2015026"&gt;has been linked to liver cancer&lt;/a&gt;, especially for people who already have other risk factors for it, such as hepatitis B infection.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Fusarium molds can grow on corn and other grains.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/corn-cobs-are-affected-by-fusarium-the-causative-royalty-free-image/2182157647"&gt;Orest Lyzhechka/iStock via Getty Images Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182211741"&gt;Fusarium&lt;/a&gt; is another group of fungal pathogens that can grow as mold on grains such as wheat, barley and corn, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.17340"&gt;especially at high humidity&lt;/a&gt;. Infected grains may appear discolored or have a pinkish or reddish hue, and they might emit a musty odor. Fusarium fungi produce &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins16020090"&gt;mycotoxins called trichothecenes&lt;/a&gt;, which can damage cells and irritate the digestive tract. They also make &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22115793"&gt;another toxin, fumonisin B1&lt;/a&gt;, which disrupts how cells build and maintain their outer membranes. Over time, these effects &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.06.007"&gt;can harm the liver and kidneys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If grains or nuts look moldy, discolored or shriveled, or if they have an unusual smell, it’s best to err on the side of caution and throw them out. Aflotoxins, especially, are known to be potent &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/25081-carcinogens"&gt;cancer-causing agents&lt;/a&gt;, so they have no safe level of exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Fruits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fruits can also harbor mycotoxins. When they become bruised or overripe, or are stored in damp conditions, mold can easily take hold and begin producing these harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One biggie is a blue mold called &lt;em&gt;Penicillium expansum,&lt;/em&gt; which is best known for infecting apples but also attacks pears, cherries, peaches and other fruit. This fungus produces patulin, a toxin that interferes with key enzymes in cells to hobble normal cell functions and generate unstable molecules called reactive oxygen species that can harm DNA, proteins and fats. In large amounts, patulin &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins10110475"&gt;can injure major organs&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins2040613"&gt;kidneys, liver, digestive tract and immune system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. expansum’s&lt;/em&gt; blue and green cousins, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.833328"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Penicillium italicum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Penicillium digitatum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are frequent flyers on oranges, lemons and other citrus fruits. It’s not clear whether they produce dangerous toxins, but they taste awful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/698198/original/file-20251023-56-hof5e5.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Penicillium digitatum forms a pretty green growth on citrus fruits that makes them taste terrible.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Penicillium_digitatum_orange.jpg"&gt;James Scott via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is tempting to just cut off the moldy parts of a fruit and eat the rest. However, molds can send out microscopic, rootlike structures called hyphae that penetrate deeply into food, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins14100699"&gt;potentially releasing toxins&lt;/a&gt; even in seemingly unaffected bits. Especially for soft fruits, where hyphae can grow more easily, it’s safest to toss moldy specimens. Do it at your own risk, but for hard fruits I do sometimes just cut off the moldy bits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cheese&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheese showcases the benefits of controlled microbial growth. In fact, mold is a crucial component in many of the cheeses you know and love. Blue cheeses such as Roquefort and Stilton get their distinctive, tangy flavor from chemicals produced by a fungus called &lt;em&gt;Penicillium roqueforti&lt;/em&gt;. And the soft, white rind on cheeses such as Brie or Camembert contributes to their flavor and texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, unwanted molds look fuzzy or powdery and may take on unusual colors. Greenish-black or reddish molds, sometimes caused by &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt; species, can be toxic and should be discarded. Also, species such as &lt;em&gt;Penicillium commune&lt;/em&gt; produce cyclopiazonic acid, a mycotoxin that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-6915%2885%2990284-4"&gt;disrupts calcium flow across cell membranes&lt;/a&gt;, potentially impairing muscle and nerve function. At high enough levels, it may cause tremors or other nervous system symptoms. Fortunately, such cases are rare, and spoiled dairy products usually give themselves away by their sharp, sour, rank odor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/698199/original/file-20251023-56-lqo1cy.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mold is a crucial component of blue cheeses, adding a distinctive, tangy taste.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/cheese-maker-inspecting-stock-royalty-free-image/1352892873"&gt;Peter Cade/Photodisc via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, discard soft cheeses such as ricotta, cream cheese and cottage cheese at the first sign of mold. Because these cheeses contain more moisture, the mold’s filaments can spread easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard cheeses, including cheddar, Parmesan and Swiss, are less porous. So cutting away at least one inch around the moldy spot is more of a safe bet – just take care not to touch the mold with your knife.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Meat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While molds are the primary concern for plant and dairy spoilage, bacteria are the main agents of meat decomposition. Telltale signs of meat spoilage include a slimy texture, discoloration that’s often greenish or brownish and a sour or putrid odor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some harmful bacteria do not produce noticeable changes in smell, appearance or texture, making it difficult to assess the safety of meat based on sensory cues alone. That stink, though, is caused by chemicals such as cadaverine and putrescine that are formed as meat decomposes, and they can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e24501"&gt;nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps,&lt;/a&gt; as well as headaches, flushing or drops in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spoiled meats are rife with bacterial dangers. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20134227/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, a common contaminant of beef&lt;/a&gt;, produces shiga toxin, which  chokes off &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7236-3"&gt;some cells’ ability to make proteins&lt;/a&gt; and can cause a dangerous kidney disease called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins15010010"&gt;hemolytic uremic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Poultry often carries &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/campylobacter/about/index.html"&gt;the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which produces a toxin that invades gastrointestinal cells, often leading to diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. It can also provoke the body’s immune system to attack its own nerves, potentially sparking a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232214222"&gt;rare condition called Guillain–Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/852195"&gt;lead to temporary paralysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Salmonella, found in eggs and undercooked chicken, is one of the most common types of food poisoning, causing diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramps. It releases toxins into the lining of the small and large intestines that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8435/"&gt;drive extensive inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Clostridium perfringens&lt;/em&gt; also attacks the gut, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2024.2341968"&gt;its toxins work by damaging cell membranes&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;em&gt;Clostridium botulinum&lt;/em&gt;, which can lurk in improperly stored or canned meats, produces botulinum toxin, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/botulism/"&gt;most potent biological poisons&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins11120686"&gt;lethal even in tiny amounts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is impossible for meat to be totally free of bacteria, but the longer it sits in your refrigerator – or worse, on your counter or in your grocery bag – the more those bacteria multiply. And you can’t cook the yuck away. Most bacteria die at meat-safe temperatures – between 145 and 165 degrees Fahrenheit (63-74 C) – but many bacterial toxins are heat stable and survive cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The DREAM database pools 2,643 sleep recordings from 505 people across 20 studies, creating the world’s largest collection of brain activity data paired with dream reports.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dreams aren’t just a REM sleep phenomenon. Analysis revealed dream reports occurred 88% of the time in light sleep, 56% in moderate sleep, 48% in deep sleep, and 81% during REM sleep.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers can predict dreaming from brain waves alone with up to 70% accuracy in REM sleep, suggesting objective markers of subjective dream experiences exist in measurable brain activity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The database remains open to new contributions and could help answer fundamental questions about consciousness, from why some people rarely remember dreams to detecting awareness in unresponsive patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists have assembled the largest collection of dream data ever created, pooling more than 2,600 sleep recordings from 505 people across 20 different studies. The Dream EEG and Mentation (DREAM) database offers an exciting new approach to studying one of neuroscience’s most elusive puzzles: what happens in our brains when we dream?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For decades, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dreams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;dream research&lt;/a&gt; has been hampered by a fundamental problem. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep studies&lt;/a&gt; require expensive equipment, trained technicians, and participants willing to spend nights in laboratories while being repeatedly awakened. Most research groups could afford to collect only dozens of observations, making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions about the sleeping brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the DREAM database changes that equation. By standardizing data from institutions worldwide and making it openly accessible, researchers have created a resource that no single laboratory could build alone. Each recording captures both the electrical activity of a sleeping brain and detailed reports of what the person experienced upon waking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-creating-a-common-language-for-dream-research"&gt;Creating a Common Language for Dream Research&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One major obstacle the project addressed was inconsistency across laboratories. Different research groups used different methods to collect and categorize dreams. Some studies relied on detailed questionnaires, others collected free-form verbal descriptions, and many employed different definitions of what counts as a dream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database introduced three standardized categories. “Experience” indicates the person recalled specific dream content. “Experience without recall” captures the phenomenon of knowing you dreamed but being unable to remember details, sometimes called white dreams. “No experience” means the person reported neither dreams nor any impression of having dreamed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This common framework allows researchers to combine observations from studies that might have seemed incompatible. A lab studying nightmares in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/transcendental-meditation-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;patients with PTSD&lt;/a&gt; can now compare their data with findings from healthy volunteers learning spatial tasks, or from experiments on lucid dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-two-decades-of-sleep-data-in-one-place"&gt;Two Decades of Sleep Data in One Place&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DREAM database spans studies conducted from the early 2000s through 2024, encompassing diverse experimental designs. Some datasets come from multiple awakenings throughout single nights. Others capture morning reports after full nights of sleep. Several studies recorded &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-teens-tired-violent-crime/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daytime naps&lt;/a&gt;. One unique dataset includes simultaneous EEG and magnetoencephalography, offering complementary views of brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participant demographics range widely. The youngest were children aged 9-14 with developmental dyslexia or matched controls. The oldest were &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/older-adults-who-eat-breakfast-early-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy adults in their sixties and seventies&lt;/a&gt;. Some studies focused on frequent sleep talkers, others on people trained to signal lucid dreams through eye movements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis of 1,550 awakenings with complete sleep stage and dream report data revealed clear patterns. Stage N1, the lightest non-REM stage, produced dream reports 88% of the time. Stage N2 yielded dreams in 56% of awakenings. Deep sleep dropped to 48% dream recall. REM sleep generated dream reports 81% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These numbers confirm what many sleep researchers suspected but struggled to prove: dreams are not exclusive to REM sleep. Reports of conscious experiences accompanied about 40-60% of non-REM awakenings, depending on sleep depth and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/disrupted-sleep-memory-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;time of night&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-quality-standards-enable-global-collaboration"&gt;Quality Standards Enable Global Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contributing a dataset required meeting specific technical benchmarks. Recordings needed at least two EEG electrodes positioned according to standard placement systems, a minimum of 20 seconds of continuous sleep before awakening, and sampling rates of at least 100 Hz. Data had to be in raw or minimally preprocessed form.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each dataset underwent both automated and manual quality checks. Curators verified proper file structure, correct data formatting, and consistency in metadata. Sleep recordings with more than 10 seconds of artifacts in the final 20 seconds before awakening were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database stores polysomnography data in European Data Format files, with each file containing the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; leading up to a dream report. Metadata for each awakening includes the dream classification, sleep stage, participant demographics when available, and experimental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contributors retain control over access levels for their data. Some datasets are fully open access. Others require researchers to request permission from the original authors, depending on what ethics committees approved for each study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-findings-point-to-objective-dream-markers"&gt;Early Findings Point to Objective Dream Markers&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the resource’s potential, the research team conducted several analyses. They applied automatic sleep scoring algorithms to six datasets that met strict quality criteria, achieving accuracy above 72% compared to human expert scoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The algorithms generated probability distributions across possible sleep stages rather than single labels. Analysis of these probabilities showed that brain activity during non-REM sleep with dream reports carried higher probability of wake-like patterns compared to non-REM sleep without dreams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team also tested whether they could predict dream experiences from brain wave patterns alone. Using both traditional frequency analysis and advanced techniques designed to capture complex signals, they distinguished dreaming from non-dreaming states with better-than-chance accuracy in both REM and non-REM sleep. For &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/poor-sleep-rewiring-teen-brains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the most sophisticated analysis reached 70% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These preliminary results suggest objective markers of subjective dream experiences exist in measurable brain activity. The database provides the scale needed to identify such markers reliably.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-questions-the-database-could-help-answer"&gt;Questions the Database Could Help Answer&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team outlined several fundamental questions that the expanding database might address. Why are we sometimes conscious and sometimes unconscious during sleep? Why do some people remember dreams every day while others rarely recall them? What makes the small percentage of people who regularly have &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/brain-during-lucid-dreaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;lucid dreams&lt;/a&gt; different from the rest?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep research also connects to broader questions about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consciousness&lt;/a&gt; in other states. Patients diagnosed with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome cannot provide behavioral reports, making it difficult to determine whether they experience awareness. Similarly, determining the depth of general anesthesia needed to prevent intraoperative awareness remains a challenge. Some patients who experience awareness during surgery describe it as similar to dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database could serve as a testing ground for methods to detect consciousness in the absence of reports. Techniques validated on sleeping, dreaming brains might transfer to these other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-resource-built-to-grow"&gt;A Resource Built to Grow&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DREAM database remains open to new contributions and will continue expanding. The core team, drawn from institutions in Australia, France, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, maintains the collection on &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/volunteering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a voluntary basis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers can search and browse metadata without downloading large data files, making it easier to identify relevant recordings for specific research questions. The standardized format allows automated analysis pipelines to process data from multiple studies without extensive reformatting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project aligns with a broader movement toward data sharing in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;. Similar collaborative databases have accelerated progress in other fields, from the Allen Institute for Brain Science to the Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience. Until this project, dream research lacked a comparable resource.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial release of 2,643 awakenings represents a starting point. As more research groups contribute their recordings, the database will grow in both size and diversity, potentially transforming how scientists study the sleeping, dreaming brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DREAM database aggregates polysomnography recordings and dream reports from 20 separate studies contributed by research institutions worldwide. Each included awakening consists of sleep EEG/MEG recording (minimum 20 seconds, 100 Hz sampling, 2+ electrodes) up to the moment of waking, plus a standardized classification of the reported experience. Contributors mapped their original dream categorization systems to three standard classifications: “Experience” (recalled specific content), “Experience without recall” (impression of dreaming without remembered details), and “No experience” (no dream reported or impression of dreaming). The initial release contains 2,643 awakenings from 505 participants. For analysis, researchers selected six datasets meeting quality criteria and extracted power spectral density features plus catch22 time-series features from three common electrodes (F4, C4, O2). Classification models attempted to discriminate “Experience” from “No experience” reports within NREM and REM sleep separately using cross-validation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The database confirmed dependence between sleep stage and dream experience with high statistical significance (chi-squared test, p&amp;lt;10^-15). Dream recall frequency decreased with NREM sleep depth, with 88% recall in N1, 56% in N2, 48% in N3, and 81% in REM. Generalized linear mixed-effects modeling accounting for study and participant grouping confirmed deeper NREM stages associated with lower odds of dream experience reports. Analysis of 1,462 thirty-second pre-awakening epochs showed automatic sleep scoring achieved average accuracy above 0.72 compared to human scoring. Bayesian ANOVA on automatically-scored sleep stage probabilities (hypnodensities) revealed both main effects of sleep stage and dream report category, with an interaction between them. NREM epochs with dream experiences showed increased probability mass toward wake-like activity. Classification models successfully discriminated dream experience from no experience in both NREM (best AUC=0.586 using power spectral density) and REM (best AUC=0.700 using catch22 features on band-filtered signals), with all results significantly above chance (Bonferroni-corrected p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dream reports depend on waking participants, which interrupts sleep and may be affected by sleep inertia, confusion, and memory decay. Report quality and comprehensiveness diminish with time. The database aggregates studies with methodological and conceptual variability in experimental protocols, awakening procedures, and original dream categorization schemes. Not all contributed datasets provided identical metadata or raw dream report text. Some datasets required reclassification or mapping to standard categories, which introduces potential inconsistencies. The prediction analysis used only six datasets meeting strict equipment and demographic criteria, excluding studies with non-standard EEG systems, sensory stimulation protocols, or participants outside typical adult age ranges. Analysis focused on a limited number of electrode positions common across studies rather than full high-density recordings. Manual sleep scoring sometimes labels epochs as “Wake” before participants report being asleep, representing subjective-objective discrepancies that complicate interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

It is approved for adults 65 and older and people 12 to 64 with an underlying medical condition that puts them at higher risk for severe COVID. The new Moderna vaccine is 10 micrograms, one-fifth the dose of the old Moderna vaccine (mRNA-1273 or Spikevax), which is 50 micrograms. Both are mRNA vaccines that target the LP.8.1 variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, all three mRNA COVID shots — both Moderna products and the Pfizer vaccine — are roughly 40% to 60% effective at preventing COVID hospitalizations and deaths. But the new Moderna vaccine elicited slightly higher antibody responses in adults 65 and older compared to the old vaccine after one month, three months and six months, according to data that Moderna &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/slides-2025-04-15-16/02-Rizkalla-COVID-508.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in April. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data was from the company’s Phase 3 clinical trial that included about 11,400 people 12 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Moderna vaccine showed a 9.3% higher relative vaccine efficacy compared to the older Moderna vaccine in people 12 and older, and a 13.5% higher relative vaccine efficacy in people 65 and older, according to the trial data. Vaccine experts caution against assuming this means the new vaccine is “better,” as it’s based on preliminary data and in any case shows levels of protection comparable to the previous mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new vaccine offers similar levels of protection as the older vaccine despite being a lower dose because of the way it’s designed. The old mRNA vaccines (both Moderna’s and Pfizer’s) target the entire spike protein, while the new Moderna vaccine targets two specific parts of the spike protein. These two parts are important because they are the regions that produce what appear to be the most protective antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, they only kept the parts of the protein that are most important for generating antibody responses, to focus the immune responses there,” said Nadia Roan, a UCSF professor and senior investigator at Gladstone Institutes who studies immunology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus of infectious diseases at UC Berkeley, describes it as “a vaccine that’s more like a rifle than a shotgun.

The company’s clinical trial data showed that the rates of pain at the infection site (sore arm) were slightly lower compared to the old Moderna vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, there aren’t huge differences except a little less injection site pain,” Roan said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the pain is a little less because you have less material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rates of other side effects — such as fever, headache and fatigue — were about the same as the old Moderna vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, Swartzberg was curious about the new Moderna shot and got it for his fall COVID vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always had a really sore arm but not much else,” he said. “This time I hardly even had a sore arm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, though, people shouldn’t be too worried about which COVID vaccine to get because they all provide protection, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d get what’s available. I don’t want anyone to read this and think, ‘Oh my god, I got the Pfizer or the more traditional mRNA vaccine, and I should’ve gotten the Nexspike,’” Swartzberg said. “They’ll get protection from all three of these.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone might consider the new Moderna vaccine if the previous mRNA shots they got gave them a very sore arm, fever or other side effects that sidelined them for days afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s up to the individual,” Roan said. “A reason to do it would be that it elicits a somewhat stronger antibody response, which could be good for the potency and durability from infection, although the clinical trial results suggested similar rates of protection. But some may also choose to stick with the familiar option if that’s what they’ve gotten before, since some may prefer to know what to expect in terms of side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Moderna vaccine may also be more stable and requires less extreme cold storage, which could give it an advantage in terms of transporting and storing it, Swartzberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 11:12:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOTzZic09USkV1SWhNamRmVHVFQ0FDOUtjZUZkaVp1WUhUREtEOXEwSnF5MW9PZUJQWmluaFVYTTdyd1ZmOVN6RVY0NElDTjE3U2hTTERtMTlzSUg0VXBZcVJ3THA0c1dLbUZFTWgwV0EyWGc3c3hvOU93Rkhkak5TdlhvbkpMc0pqWEZrVFdn</guid></item><item><title>流行病学家塞思·伯克利（ Seth Berkley ）博士说： “这是我们以前从未见过的完全不同的抗疫苗参与水平。”</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/this-is-a-completely-different-level-of-anti-vaccine-engagement-than-weve-ever-seen-before-says-epidemiologist-dr-seth-berkley</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

In doing that, we had all kinds of problems, but in the end, we did do the fastest and largest rollout of vaccines in history. We ended up with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/transformative-power-solidarity-look-back-vaccine-alliances-2023" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/transformative-power-solidarity-look-back-vaccine-alliances-2023" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;57% of people in the developing world&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the poorest 92 countries, getting coverage with primary doses, versus 67% globally — so not perfect equity, but better than it had ever been done before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="fd3435af-77b2-4936-b7bb-f2293b0fd2f4"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Dr. Seth Berkley. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Courtesy of University of California Press)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="ff47d0d3-ccc2-4570-ad11-5ad828a5093a"&gt;What I was worried about is [that] people wouldn't capture the lessons learned, both good and bad. The book tries to explain what it took to get there, and also who were the good players, who were the bad players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, since the book was written, the world has changed dramatically. I couldn't — I mean, I suppose I could have ripped the book up and started writing again. I didn't do that, but I did have a chance to say in the preface, and then later on at the end of the book, how much had changed, given the intense anti-vaccine attitudes that we're seeing right now in the U.S. government, particularly in the secretary of health and human services [HHS], Robert Kennedy Jr., who is a long-term vaccine skeptic and a conspiracy theorist on these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ieA2dgHUMBwBrXk5aXueBm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ieA2dgHUMBwBrXk5aXueBm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's obviously quite concerning in regard to how that may affect Americans. But also it's important for Americans to understand that the vaccine work that's done in other countries also affects America, because the diseases we get come from both inside and outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: On that point, we've seen the U.S. withdraw support from initiatives that support vaccine equity globally. What are the potential impacts of that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SB: &lt;/strong&gt;So if we go back — I'll use a period of 50 years, for convenience — less than 5% of people in the world received even a single dose of vaccine. Not all the doses that were recommended — a single dose. And we've gone from that level up until vaccines, now, are the most widely distributed health intervention in the world. Along with that, we've seen a 70% reduction in vaccine-preventable disease deaths, and we've seen a more than 50% reduction in under-5 child mortality, directly as a result of this type of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is a really big deal. We've also seen control of many infectious diseases: the eradication of smallpox, the almost complete elimination of wild polio, the control of measles in many countries, etc. etc. Those are the successes. But the idea now is that we back away from this, when we have these infectious diseases that are still a risk — and as we've recently seen in the U.S., we've had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/when-will-the-us-measles-outbreak-end" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/when-will-the-us-measles-outbreak-end"&gt;&lt;u&gt;some big measles outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. actually had received the status of having eliminated endogenous measles infections, meaning that when new infections would occur, they had to come from outside. Now, the U.S. is at risk of losing that designation. This is why it's so important to think about it globally, because if we see many more measles infections occurring in other countries and given the movement of people, you're eventually going to see those cases in the United States if vaccine rates go down. And they are going down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've got a situation where people are discrediting experts and putting people in place who do not have expertise and have preconceived notions on vaccines. They say they're trying to increase trust, but I don't see how that increases trust. And we're now fractured in the U.S.; you've seen most recently this idea that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/who-is-eligible-for-this-years-covid-vaccine-everything-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/who-is-eligible-for-this-years-covid-vaccine-everything-you-need-to-know"&gt;&lt;u&gt;states are coming together to put out their own recommendations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Professional societies are putting out recommendations, instead of having one definitive set. In the end, I don't think that helps with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Do you feel these shifts in the U.S. stem from an amplification of an old problem we've had, or more from a brand-new issue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SB: &lt;/strong&gt;It's a little of both. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/vaccine-rejection-is-as-old-as-vaccines-themselves-science-historian-thomas-levenson-on-the-history-of-germ-theory-and-its-deniers" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/vaccine-rejection-is-as-old-as-vaccines-themselves-science-historian-thomas-levenson-on-the-history-of-germ-theory-and-its-deniers"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vaccine hesitancy has existed from the first vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was in the 1700s smallpox right after the original vaccine was shown to work. There were cartoons showing — because the vaccine was derived from cows — there were pictures of people with cow horns growing out of their heads and all kinds of things like that. So this is not a new problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is new is having the intense politicization of this — the idea that one political party more than another political party has these beliefs and therefore acts on them, so there are different coverage slates for vaccines for different parties. And then finally, [there's] the fact that you've got government leaders that are pushing these conspiracy theories and discrediting institutions that have scientific professionals and mechanisms that have been set up to try to have the best science possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During COVID, we saw Russian bots and Chinese bots that were providing disinformation, and of course, this spread like wildfire. But also for the first time that I know of, we had the U.S. government, the Defense Department, putting out misinformation to try to discredit the Chinese vaccine. So this is a kind of warfare that's going on that has some terrible effects. … This is a completely different level of anti-vaccine engagement than we've ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a9cd6405-782f-4b57-84c3-5163b7a4cead"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;By definition, everybody should invest their marginal dollars in preventing disease before they get to investing in treating diseases — but that's not human nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr. Seth Berkley, Brown University&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="343afbe2-6bab-4bc5-bfd7-48e9f9591e67"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: You often hear the argument that, because vaccines have worked so well, people lack a fear of vaccine-preventable diseases. Do you see any validity to that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SB: &lt;/strong&gt;When you look at this new era of misinformation — as I said, there's always been vaccine misinformation. But the difference is, if you are in a country that has very high vaccination rates and therefore the diseases have virtually disappeared, it's very easy for a parent to say, "I don't want my kid to be injected with something. … I don't know anything about these diseases. I've never seen them. How bad can they be?" So that's one side of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you're living in a developing country and these diseases are still there, you see kids that have morbidity from these diseases. You see people paralyzed from polio. You see people who are blind or deaf from German measles [also called rubella]. And so your benefit-harm ratio is seen as different in these different populations. And it's the job of science to ask the question, what is the benefit-to-cost ratio of these products?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing that's really hard is, because we don't see these diseases, you don't know the kind of really severe side effects that occur. In measles, there's a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-has-long-term-health-consequences-for-kids-vaccines-can-prevent-all-of-them" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/measles-has-long-term-health-consequences-for-kids-vaccines-can-prevent-all-of-them"&gt;&lt;u&gt;disease called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It's a fairly rare disease — but when it happens, the child's brain dissolves, and there is nothing you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that you don't want people to live in fear all the time, but no parent wants that to happen to their child. It's about how you can both educate and have people aware of the side effects of these diseases, and even ones that are rare. That's really the challenge right now. I think the only way to solve that is education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: Another focus of the book is a roadmap to global vaccine equity. What do you see as the biggest obstacles to that goal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SB: &lt;/strong&gt;First of all, the stuff we've just discussed, which is having awareness of the value of vaccination, and that's critical for populations everywhere in the world. And obviously keeping that knowledge up even when the diseases get rarer and rarer is really important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second critical point is having access to vaccines. What Gavi was able to do was, by consolidating the buying power of many different countries, we were able to drive the price [of routine vaccines] down 98% from that of what it cost in the United States, which makes it really affordable. Vaccines are cost-effective even at higher prices, but obviously the more affordable they are, the better it is. So a priority is making sure that those products are available and that they are being produced in the quantities they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third part of it is having delivery systems in place, and this is really a challenge. As I mentioned at the beginning, vaccines are the most widely distributed health intervention, and about 90% of families in the world have access to routine vaccines. … Reaching [the last 10%] with that system not only provides vaccines but also provides health access, and it also means there is an early warning system to make sure that there are health workers for everybody — so that if there are outbreaks or weird diseases that appear, you have a system that can report back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I'd say that there's importance in having global surveillance for new infections. It's evolutionarily certain we're going to have new outbreaks and new pandemics, and that warning system is critical for everybody in the world. Building this prevention system, which is very cost-effective, is the right thing to do everywhere, and it's a matter of making that a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: I want to come back to the point that epidemics and pandemics are essentially inevitable. With that in mind, how do we prepare?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SB: &lt;/strong&gt;Epidemics are evolutionarily certain — certainly, that's true. So the first part of that is, how do we prepare for things that we know, like flu, like COVID, like hemorrhagic fevers? These are things that we now have interventions for. And how do we make sure that the world is ready, that there are systems of laboratories, that there are stockpiles of vaccines ready to go, and [that there's] the ability to scale them up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, a lot of that is now being broken apart. At this moment in time, we [the United States] are firing people in major health agencies. We're pulling out of the World Health Organization. We're changing our development assistance and stopping training of scientists, etc. etc. So we are breaking down the systems that exist to deal with that [preparation for known threats], which is a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, when you get to the "unknown unknowns," you also want to have the science ready to go. There's a good example right now, of pulling out of mRNA vaccines. [The HHS recently &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/these-decisions-were-completely-reckless-funding-cuts-to-mrna-vaccines-will-make-america-more-vulnerable-to-pandemics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pulled funding from research-and-development projects focused on mRNA vaccines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.] mRNA vaccines may not be perfect; they may not even be the best vaccines for some diseases. But they are the fastest, because you can make them very quickly from the genome. Then you can, in essence, "print" the vaccine and scale it up very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of a very severe pandemic that has a very high mortality rate, that is the best way: to make an mRNA vaccine to deal with it. The idea that we would not want to continue to work on mRNA — improving it, making it better — and instead we're just pulling research out seems to me to be very, very shortsighted indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: To continue on mRNA, would you say that in a pandemic scenario, it's speed that's the most crucial element of the vaccine? Or are there other advantages to the mRNA platform?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SB: &lt;/strong&gt;The absolute advantage there is speed. And remember, COVID had a mortality rate of about 1.5%, 2%. Some of the other diseases that we know of, that potentially could spread, have mortality rates of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%. If you had something like that — that's a respiratory pathogen spreading quickly with very high mortality rates — every hour counts in terms of speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So mRNA is the fastest. … It may be that, once you have mRNA vaccines, you may want to shift to other vaccines that may give longer duration of protection, give better immune responses, etc. [for a given pathogen]. But you can't make those in the same time frame, so it may be a handoff from one to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges in COVID was that there were over 200 different vaccines that were made, but mRNA was so fast out of the block that others really didn't get a chance to become successful. If I use an example, the Novavax vaccine, which is a protein[-based vaccine], never really got global traction, even though it was a very effective, very safe vaccine that maybe had a longer duration of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is, how do we, in that setting, have comparative science to say which are the best products? That will not be done by the pharmaceutical sector because they don't have any incentive to do head-to-head comparisons. That needs to be done by international agencies or by governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ca1e53f0-b0af-42e7-b59f-a7c8976ffbdd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NL: What else can readers expect from "Fair Doses"?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SB: &lt;/strong&gt;The book is also filled with lots of interesting nuggets of stories of who behaved well and who didn't behave well during the pandemic, and that includes political leaders, that includes pharmaceutical companies, that includes agencies. So it gives a nuanced understanding of what that time really looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We came together, along with our partners, to try to see if we could change the normal dynamic that occurs in a pandemic, which is wealthy countries buy all the doses and there's no doses available for anybody else. That was our goal going into it, and the book tells the story of how we put together this initiative, how we raised the $12.5 billion necessary to buy vaccines, how we ultimately delivered more than 2 billion doses to 146 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the questions is, how do we do better? What do we learn from that? And that's something we try to explore in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor's note: This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="09f3dfaa-b58e-4eff-b226-bee7a3aea4a6"&gt;

You may want to stop, or at the very least, check the ingredients. While protein powder is often marketed as a healthy, lower-calorie option for people trying to lose or maintain weight, a lot of them are filled with artificial sweeteners, according to neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://friederikefabritius.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Friederike Fabritius;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Friederike Fabritius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is those additives that really give me pause when it comes to protein powders because they wreak havoc on your gastrointestinal microbiome,” Fabritius said. “A healthy and robust internal microbiome is so important for great brain health because most of our neurotransmitters are produced in the gut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Virojt Changyencham / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sorry, soda drinkers.

Acutely, sugar also causes brain inflammation, irritability, poor mood and sleep disturbances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Plus, the constant highs and lows (the proverbial sugar “rush” and “crash”) can also cause a state of addiction with cravings and withdrawals — and diet soda is no better. “Even diet or zero versions of soda have negative effects, as the calorie-free additives stress out the brain and trick it into consuming more calories and craving real sugar,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Margarine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jennifer_mcphee/fancy-gourmet-desserts-trivia-quiz?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:If You Can Identify 10/14 Of These “Rich People Desserts,” You’ve Officially Got Extremely Bougie Taste;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;If You Can Identify 10/14 Of These “Rich People Desserts,” You’ve Officially Got Extremely Bougie Taste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Frank Muckenheim / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Down with fake butter! &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1720493141/shae-datta" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Shae Datta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Shae Datta&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist and co-director of the NYU Langone Concussion Center, said she avoids margarine as much as possible because it contains trans fats.

                The Tdap vaccine protects against whooping cough (pertussis), which is particularly dangerous for infants. Because infants can't get their first vaccination against pertussis until they are 2 months old, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that pregnant women get vaccinated in the third trimester, in order to pass immunity to their newborns.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When there's an outbreak of a vaccine-preventable disease, state health officials typically take certain steps to alert residents and issue public updates about the growing threat. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's standard practice, public health and infectious disease experts told NPR and KFF Health News. The goal is to keep as many other vulnerable people as possible from getting sick and to remind the public about the benefits of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But in Louisiana this year, public health officials appeared not to have followed that playbook during the state's worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease that's particularly dangerous for the youngest infants. It can cause vomiting and trouble breathing, and serious infections can lead to pneumonia, seizures and, rarely, death.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Madison Flake, a pediatric resident in Baton Rouge, La., cared for a baby who was hospitalized during this year's outbreak. At less than 2 months old, he was sent to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"He would have these bouts of very dramatic coughing spells," Flake said. "He would stop breathing for several seconds to almost a minute."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they're &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;2 months old&lt;/a&gt;, but they can acquire immunity if their mother was immunized while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By late January 2025, two babies had died in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Louisiana Department of Health waited two months to send out a social media post suggesting people talk to their doctors about getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The department took even longer to issue a statewide &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-CP/HANs/2025/HAN-25_2-Statewide-Increase-in-Pertussis-Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;health alert&lt;/a&gt; to physicians, send out a press release or hold a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those delays are not typical, according to &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/about-apha/executive-board-and-staff/apha-staff/georges-c-benjamin-md" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Georges Benjamin&lt;/a&gt;, the executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.apha.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American Public Health Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Particularly for these childhood diseases, we usually jump all over these," said Benjamin, who has led health departments in Maryland and the District of Columbia. "These are preventable diseases and preventable deaths."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because infectious diseases spread exponentially, if officials don't alert the public quickly, they lose a key chance to prevent further infections, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/abraar-karan" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Abraar Karan&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor on infectious diseases at Stanford University who has worked on COVID-19 and mpox outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Time is perhaps one of the most important currencies that you have," he added.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Amid outbreak, state surgeon general stopped state promotion of all vaccines &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because pertussis vaccine immunity wanes over time, cases can ebb and flow over time. But in September 2024, Louisiana health officials started seeing a "substantial" increase in whooping cough cases, part of a national &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;increase in cases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In late January 2025, physicians inside one Louisiana hospital warned their colleagues that two infants had died in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 13, the state's surgeon general, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/office-of-the-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;Ralph Abraham&lt;/a&gt;, sent a memo to staff &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-02-14/louisiana-department-of-health-officially-ends-all-vaccine-promotion-events" target="_blank"&gt;ending the general promotion of vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and community vaccine events.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He sent that email a few hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, won Senate confirmation as the new U.S. health and human services secretary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Also that day, Abraham posted a &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/7478" target="_blank"&gt;public memo&lt;/a&gt; on the Louisiana Department of Health's website. In it, he said public health had overstepped with vaccine recommendations, which, he said, are driven by "a one-size-fits-all, collectivist mentality." Abraham has called COVID-19 vaccines "&lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1966237494627983445" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt;" and has been a &lt;a href="https://www.thecentersquare.com/opinion/article_046632f2-b423-4918-afa4-3434e1cc5b8b.html" target="_blank"&gt;vocal supporter&lt;/a&gt; of Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Four days later, in response to a request from a TV news station in New Orleans, the Louisiana Department of Health confirmed the deaths of two infants from whooping cough for the first time, in an email. WVUE Fox 8 then &lt;a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2025/02/21/highly-contagious-whooping-cough-cases-rise/" target="_blank"&gt;published the news&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Louisiana Department of Health sent out no alerts, according to a review of external and internal communications by NPR and KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the next month, two more infants were hospitalized for whooping cough, according to internal health department emails, obtained through a public records request.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In March, after inquiries from NPR and KFF Health News about the growing number of pertussis cases, the health department put out its first social media communications about the outbreak and offered interviews to other journalists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then in May — at least three months after the second infant death — the health department issued what appears to be its first and so far only official &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-CP/HANs/2025/HAN-25_2-Statewide-Increase-in-Pertussis-Cases.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; to physicians. It put out its &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/news/whooping-cough" target="_blank"&gt;first press release&lt;/a&gt;, and it then held a press conference about pertussis on May 14.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;By then, 42 people, three-quarters of whom were not up to date on their whooping cough immunizations, had been hospitalized for whooping cough since the outbreak began, &lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/05.14.25-Measles-and-Pertussis-Update.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Louisiana Department of Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of those hospitalized were babies under age 1.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Throughout the summer, cases of pertussis continued to climb in Louisiana. But there were no further public communications from the Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR and KFF contacted the department for comment on Sept. 25. A spokeswoman did not answer specific questions about the lack of communications but referred to a Sept. 30 &lt;a href="https://x.com/la_surgeon/status/1973028756710109660" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; by the state surgeon general.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the post, Abraham said the department "consistently reported cases of pertussis and provided guidance to help residents stay protected" in 2025. He called the pertussis vaccine "one of the least controversial" and said he recommends it to his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The post on X included a year-by-year graphic of pertussis cases that omitted 2024 and 2025. The post also acknowledged for the first time that one of the infant deaths occurred in late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A "train wreck" of cases and hospitalizations&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Louisiana should have started warning the public within days or a week of the first infant's death, instead of waiting months, said Stanford's Karan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At minimum, it should be like heavy promotion of, 'Hey, infants are at high risk. They get infected by people who have waning immunity. If you haven't gotten vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you have these symptoms, get tested,'" Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While deaths from a vaccine-preventable illness are tragic, they can also serve as an opportunity to educate the public about the benefits of vaccines and try to save lives, according to &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/1781/joshua-m-sharfstein" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Joshua Sharfstein&lt;/a&gt;, a former health secretary for Maryland, and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The risk of pertussis is always there, but when you have two infant deaths it's a really good opportunity to communicate that this is a real threat to the health of children," Sharfstein said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;By not acting more quickly, Karan said he believes the department may have set itself up for a worse outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Because then what we see is this train wreck thereafter, of like an insanely large outbreak, a lot of hospitalizations," Karan said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The outbreak continued&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As of Sept. 20, Louisiana had counted &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/232491" target="_blank"&gt;387 cases of whooping cough in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The previous &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/public-health/2025-09-03/louisianas-deadly-whooping-cough-outbreak-is-now-its-worst-in-35-years" target="_blank"&gt;35-year high&lt;/a&gt; was 214 cases, in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Until the Sept. 30 post on X, the Louisiana Department of Health did not appear to put out any public communications about pertussis over the preceding four months, as hospitalizations continued and case levels surpassed the 2013 levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The health department should be responding aggressively and consistently, said &lt;a href="https://www.laaap.org/chapter-information/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Joseph Bocchini&lt;/a&gt;, the president of the Louisiana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Where people are updated on a regular basis and reminded of what needs to be done," he said. "Get your vaccines. Moms, if you're pregnant, get vaccinated.

He developed a rare allergy to the chemotherapy, and died rapidly. The case still haunts her. “When you have a patient dying of a treatment that you gave, you never forget that,” she said. “It’s very present.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The medical team figured the tumor plus the allergy led to his death. But Merad couldn’t shake how extreme the allergic reaction was and insisted on an autopsy. Within hours, she had lung tissue. “We did what we call a warm autopsy. I looked at it and, I mean, these lesions,” she recalled, holding her hands up. “The cancer was gone. There were no cancer cells, and it was full of macrophages.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sight stunned her. Macrophages, immune cells often called the “gatekeepers” of the immune response, were known to often be immunosuppressive in the context of cancer, dampening the body’s natural ability to fight it. But in this case, Merad thought they must have been connected to a massive inflammatory response that had destroyed the tumor, but also the lung. If she could understand that inflammatory process, she thought, then maybe it could be harnessed for powerful new therapies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I became convinced that, somehow, these macrophages could be extremely potent,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since the inception of cancer immunotherapy, most of the field has focused on T cells, the immune system’s specialized killers and its primary tool against tumors. Immunotherapies have transformed cancer treatment in the last decade, with Merck’s Keytruda, engineered cell therapies like CAR-T, and other T cell-targeting drugs extending lives and even completely eliminating tumors in some cases. But many patients don’t respond or eventually stop responding to these therapies. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Merad and a growing number of researchers believe macrophages are the key to making immunotherapies work for more people. They are seeing hope from early clinical trial data that macrophage targeted therapies might be able to synergize with T cell therapies and enhance immunotherapy for cancer. Biologists are starting to dive into how these cells may be central to aging, which may lead to new treatments for diseases like dementia and even new ways to help people age better and improve their health span. Companies and academic labs are also experimenting with macrophages to help control inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like lupus.&lt;/p&gt;

The Food and Drug Administration says it is fast-tracking &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/22/fda-moves-to-approve-leucovorin-autism-treatment-gsk-wellcovorin/"&gt;leucovorin&lt;/a&gt;, a long-established drug, for potential use in treating &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071909120300462" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cerebral folate deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, a condition connected to the presence of folate receptor autoantibodies estimated to be present in up to 76% of children diagnosed with autism. Like many parents of children with autism for whom there are no other treatment options, I had asked my child’s physician about prescribing leucovorin off-label after hearing about it on Facebook groups and other social media.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The excitement surrounding leucovorin, or folinic acid, isn’t unfounded. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7477301/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Small clinical studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown improvements in language, communication, and adaptive behavior among children with autism, particularly those with folate receptor autoantibodies that block folate transport to the brain. The biological rationale is plausible: Folinic acid can bypass that blockade, restoring folate metabolism and possibly improving neural function. Leucovorin is a well-known drug that has been used safely for decades to mitigate chemotherapy toxicity and treat certain metabolic disorders. That long safety record, combined with suggestive early data in autism, has prompted regulators to consider a shortcut: approval first, large studies later. For families, this feels like long-overdue action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For scientists, it’s an unsettling precedent. History is littered with treatments that appeared miraculous in small studies only to falter, or even cause harm, once widely adopted. Ordinarily, a new drug or indication must prove itself through multiple phases of clinical trials treating thousands of patients over several years before the FDA gives its blessing. These trials don’t just confirm benefit, they reveal who benefits, at what dose, and at what risk. When that process is abbreviated, the burden of discovery shifts to what happens &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the drug reaches the public. In other words, the experiment moves from the laboratory to the living room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If we skip the traditional trial pathway, we must replace it with something equally rigorous. That’s why the United States urgently needs to establish a national leucovorin-autism patient registry: a structured, transparent system to track how this drug performs in real life — its successes, its failures, and its risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A national registry is not a bureaucratic tool; it is a scientific necessity. It would let us learn, in real time, which children benefit, which do not, and what unforeseen side effects emerge. A registry would collect standardized data from every child prescribed leucovorin for autism, capturing diagnosis, genotype, dosage, lab results, and clinical outcomes measured on validated autism scales. Periodic follow-ups would document progress or setbacks. Linked to electronic health records, it could automatically log adverse events, hospitalizations, and long-term outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Such a system would allow researchers to analyze thousands of cases, uncovering trends invisible in small studies: which genetic or metabolic profiles predict benefit, which dosing schedules work best, and whether improvements persist or fade. By publishing annual summaries, aggregated outcomes, side-effect profiles, and subgroup analyses, a registry would serve as a neutral, data-driven source of truth. Parents could see population-level results; clinicians could benchmark their experiences; scientists could access anonymized datasets for deeper study. Without such expert analysis families will be left with social-media anecdotes or fragmented physician reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Registries can be costly and imperfect, but their challenges are solvable. Integrating participation into electronic medical records minimizes clinician workload, while modest reimbursement and standardized outcome measures ensure consistency and engagement. Modern analytic tools — such as propensity matching and self-controlled case series — can correct for bias, and strict privacy safeguards keep data de-identified, encrypted, and ethically governed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Funding should be shared: Federal agencies can provide the backbone, academic centers can coordinate, and foundations or patient groups can sustain operations. A fraction of what is spent on large clinical trials could support a registry that continuously learns from every patient treated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/innovation-fda/fda-facts-postmarket-patient-registry-ensures-access-safe-and-effective-devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;registries&lt;/a&gt; have been established for cancer treatments, medical devices, and vaccines. These systems have prevented harm, guided practice, and shaped policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, these registries were established for treatments that had passed the traditional regulatory approval process. While the FDA has promised post-market surveillance for leucovorin for autism, all stakeholders have to trust the process. Such surveillance should not be left to the drug manufacturers, as is typically the case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A further complication is that there will likely be several vendors for the drug and there will be a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/23/leucovorin-autism-treatment-folinic-acid-supplements-are-different/"&gt;large market&lt;/a&gt; for over-the-counter supplements of folinic acid. Oversight by a consortium of government agencies, academic institutions, and autism advocacy groups is essential to ensure credibility of scientific data and its analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Autism is emotionally charged terrain. A rumor earlier this year of a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/24/no-new-autism-registry-hhs-says-contradicting-nih-director-jay-bhattacharya-claim/"&gt;planned autism registry&lt;/a&gt; raised concerns about government intrusion and overreach among stakeholders. Families, physicians, and researchers are often divided between hopeful early adopters and cautious skeptics. A transparent registry focused on leucovorin treatment could bridge that divide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public transparency is also vital for trust. Approving a drug for autism without large trials invites scrutiny. Openness about what’s working and what’s not would reassure the scientific community that speed and rigor can coexist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fast-tracking leucovorin for autism is a bold act of regulatory flexibility, but boldness must be matched with accountability. A trusted national registry would provide families with evidence-based guidance, help clinicians refine dosing, and allow policymakers to make informed coverage decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Science does not end with approval — it evolves with every patient. If the nation chooses to act quickly on leucovorin, it must also choose to act wisely by building the infrastructure to learn from real-world experience. That is not just innovation; it is responsible medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, D.C. — After peaking at a record high of 39.9% in 2022, the U.S. adult obesity rate has gradually declined to 37.0% in 2025. This is a statistically meaningful decrease representing an estimated 7.6 million fewer obese adults compared with three years ago. Meanwhile, diagnoses of diabetes — a lifetime disease that can be managed but not cured — have now reached an all-time high of 13.8%. Both metrics are part of the ongoing &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/246200/gallup-national-health-index-work.aspx"&gt;Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-embeddable-marker=""&gt;###Embeddable###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallup calculates obesity using the federal standard of having a BMI of 30 or higher, while the diabetes rate includes both those with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. This is based on a question that asks U.S. adults, “Has a doctor or nurse ever told you that you have diabetes?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent results are based on combined data from three nationally representative surveys of 16,946 U.S. adults interviewed by web in the first three quarters of 2025 using the probability-based &lt;a href="https://www.gallup.com/174158/gallup-panel-methodology.aspx"&gt;Gallup Panel&lt;/a&gt;. Gallup uses respondents’ self-reported height and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI) and subsequent weight classes. A “vanity effect” in how respondents present themselves may explain why Gallup’s obesity estimates are typically somewhat lower than those obtained from studies that use randomized clinical measurements. However, because Gallup’s method of collecting self-reported weight and height has been consistent, the trend still provides valuable information regarding changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being obese corresponds with a higher rate of having diabetes across &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/207488/obesity-quadruples-diabetes-risk-adults.aspx"&gt;all age groups&lt;/a&gt;. Still, not all individuals who are obese will develop diabetes, and some who are of a healthy weight will nevertheless get the disease. Factors other than obesity status or age could increase the risk of developing diabetes, including physical inactivity, race and ethnicity, and genetic predisposition. As diabetes is a lifetime disease, short-term reductions in the obesity rate would not be expected to curtail the percentage of Americans who have been diagnosed with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use of Weight Loss Injectables Has Risen Sharply Since Early 2024&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, more Americans have turned to Type 2 antidiabetic GLP-1 drugs such as semaglutide (brand names Ozempic and Wegovy) for weight loss purposes. The percentage of adults who report taking this class of medicine specifically for weight loss has increased to 12.4%, compared with 5.8% in February 2024 when Gallup first measured it. Usage among women (15.2%) continues to outpace men (9.7%), but both groups have more than doubled their use in the past year. These results dovetail with increased awareness of the drugs used for weight loss, which has risen from 80% to 89% nationally in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-embeddable-marker=""&gt;###Embeddable###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with the higher proportion of women who take weight loss injections, the obesity rate for women has come down slightly more than the rate for men since 2022. The rate among men has dropped 2.3 percentage points to 35.2% in 2025, while women's rate has dropped 3.5 points to 38.8%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide was approved by the FDA for weight loss in 2021, while liraglutide (brand name Saxenda) was approved in 2014. Among those who have been diagnosed with diabetes, 14.1% report using these drugs for weight loss purposes, slightly higher than the general adult population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use of Weight Loss Injectables Aligns With Weight Loss Across Age Groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid increased use of GLP-1 injectables for weight loss, obesity rates have been coming down for most age groups since 2022. The biggest reduction in obesity is found among those aged 40 to 49 and those aged 50 to 64, which are also the age groups with the greatest current rates of usage of GLP-1 injectables for weight loss purposes and the greatest increases in use of those injectables since the first quarter of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The obesity rate among those aged 40 to 49 has come down 4.3 points, falling to 43.3% alongside the current 16.2% rate of GLP-1 usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those aged 50 to 64 have seen their obesity rate drop 5.0 points to 42.8%, with 17.0% currently reporting use of the medicine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The youngest adults and seniors are essentially unchanged in their obesity rates, while the rate has fallen 2.2 points among 30- to 39-year-olds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallup did not measure use of GLP-1s for weight loss in 2022 or 2023, but available data via the Well-Being Index are consistent with reports of steadily increasing use since the initial FDA approval in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-embeddable-marker=""&gt;###Embeddable###&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aged 65 and older have the third-highest rate of reported usage of GLP-1 drugs for weight loss (11.1%) and in increased usage since the first quarter of 2024 (6.5 points) among the five age groups but (as noted above) show no reduction in obesity since 2022. Prior Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644861/injectable-weight-loss-drugs-uses-work.aspx"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, however, has indicated a significant reduction in reports of the effectiveness of the GLP-1 injections for weight loss among these older Americans compared with younger age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Implications&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obesity has climbed in the U.S. since Gallup began ongoing measurement in 2008, increasing over 14 percentage points to 39.9% by 2022 amid wide-ranging &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/546989/physical-health-plummets-pandemic.aspx"&gt;declines in physical health&lt;/a&gt; over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the recent decline, U.S. obesity rates &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/20057/obesity-rates-eu/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=item_696599&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy"&gt;continue to exceed&lt;/a&gt; many Western countries, perhaps buttressing domestic efforts to make semaglutide more accessible. Currently, 13 states fully cover &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/medicaid-coverage-of-and-spending-on-glp-1s/?utm_source=link_newsv9&amp;amp;utm_campaign=item_696599&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy"&gt;GLP-1s for obesity treatment under Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;, and legislative efforts continue to target expanded coverage. Expanding access to these treatments may be an important factor in determining whether the current decline in obesity becomes a lasting trend, since despite recent declines the U.S. obesity rate remains very high by historical standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With nearly nine in 10 Americans now aware of these weight loss drugs, the 12.4% of U.S. adults using GLP-1 injectables demonstrates how quickly semaglutide and related drugs have entered the public health sphere. According to Pew Research Center, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/02/26/how-americans-view-weight-loss-drugs-and-their-potential-impact-on-obesity-in-the-u-s/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=item_696599&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of American adults (53%) say that weight loss drugs are good options for people with obesity or weight-related health conditions. Still, not all stigma has faded: 62% of U.S. adults say semaglutide is &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/02/26/how-americans-view-weight-loss-drugs-and-their-potential-impact-on-obesity-in-the-u-s/?utm_source=link_newsv9&amp;amp;utm_campaign=item_696599&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy"&gt;not a good option&lt;/a&gt; for people who do not have a weight-related health condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing popularity of GLP-1s has led to healthier BMI scores but has not lessened the rate of diabetes diagnoses, which is a lifetime diagnosis. Only if the rate of new diabetes cases starts to decline will the U.S. rate eventually follow. (Although the approval of the monoclonal antibody teplizumab in 2022, which has recently shown promise as a &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-cure-for-type-1-diabetes-may-be-closer-than-you-think/?utm_source=link_newsv9&amp;amp;utm_campaign=item_696599&amp;amp;utm_medium=copy"&gt;potential cure for Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, could cut the rate among all age groups.) As such, while GLP-1s support weight management, they should not be considered a cure-all for overall health or other disease states. Prior Gallup &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/644861/injectable-weight-loss-drugs-uses-work.aspx"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, however, does show that previous users of GLP-1s report somewhat lower rates of obesity-related chronic conditions than do current users, suggesting that GLP-1s can play a modest role in reducing disease burden generally over longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic factors, too, cannot be overlooked. In terms of Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for over 90% of adult cases of diabetes, some people are more susceptible due to inherited risk. But healthy habits like eating fruits and vegetables and getting adequate physical activity can enhance the benefits of these medications. Gallup’s data from 2023 suggest that U.S. adults have worse health habits and outcomes than they did just four years earlier in 2019. Sustained health progress will likely depend not only on medical innovation but also on rebuilding healthier daily routines that complement pharmacological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

                More people are using injectable drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound to control their weight, and the United States' high obesity rate is coming down a bit.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The number of people using injectable obesity treatments is increasing rapidly, and it is leading to declines in obesity, according to a new survey by the Gallup National Health and Well-Being Index.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The obesity rate dropped to 37% of U.S. adults this year, down from a high of 39.9% three years ago, according to the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey found that the number of Americans taking drugs like semaglutide (which include the brands Ozempic and Wegovy) or tirzepatide (under the brands Zepbound and Mounjaro) for weight loss more than doubled over the past year and a half. That's 12.4% of respondents taking the drugs compared with 5.8% in February 2024, when Gallup first measured it. GLP-1 agonists, as the new treatments are known, were first approved in the U.S. market in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;GLP-1s, which act on the brain and the body's hormones to help suppress hunger and slow digestion, were considered a watershed in Americans' long struggle to address obesity and related diseases, which have persistently and stubbornly increased through the decades, through various dietary trends and public health interventions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The survey is one indication that this may be starting to change, albeit slowly. Since the drugs have come on the market, declines in obesity rates have been higher among those between ages 40 and 64, correlating with a higher reliance on GLP-1 medications for that age group. Use of the medications is highest among those ages 50 to 64, for example, and in that cohort, obesity rates dropped 5.0 points to 42.8%. Similarly, the survey found more women take the drugs, with corresponding greater weight loss compared with men too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;These drugs have been a game changer for patients with obesity, but access to the drugs is still limited. Access is poised to become a bigger issue, says Dr. Fatima Cody Stanford, a Harvard University obesity specialist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say this correlation happened for those that had great coverage, but it's going to be pulled back," she says, noting that many private insurers — including ones that cover most of her patients — are stopping coverage of GLP-1 medications as of next year. Without coverage, Stanford says, injections will typically cost patients about $500 a month out of pocket. And while drugmakers are working to bring potentially less-expensive pill versions to market, for example, she says it likely still will put the treatments out of reach for many.&lt;/p&gt;

Friends are now sending me articles and clippings about cancer research and the promise of new therapies. If they had actually READ these articles, they would see that clinical trials on humans are far off, or that the type of cancer referred to in the article is different from what my relative has. Why offer hope when there is none? The same thing happened to me when I had cancer 20 years ago. In one instance, I received an article about how to prevent the cancer I already had! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="CG2ROG7VONE6ZHDYKVV2DAA7G4"&gt;Please remind your readers that although these items are most often sent with love, they do little to help the individual experiencing the illness and treatment and can cause anger and pain.

Out of a need to do SOMETHING, they will send articles, some of which are inappropriate.

		&lt;p&gt;Winter used to feel like a test of endurance: grey skies, late trains, and that heavy hush that drops at 4pm. This year, something else is happening. From kitchen tables to therapy rooms and group chats, people are swapping grind-for-grit and chasing steadiness over perfection. The question isn’t “How do I get through it?” anymore. It’s “How do I come out stronger?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bus doors slide open and a gust of air smelling faintly of rain pushes in. A woman in a navy coat taps her Oyster, eyes half on the platform clock, half on the text from her sister: “How are you holding up?” At the coffee stand, the barista’s radio hums a slow song, and everyone looks softer under the yellow light. You can almost hear the collective exhale as January settles into routine. We’ve all had that moment when the cold nudges your thoughts into a smaller room and you wonder if your spark got left on a brighter day. What if winter wasn’t the villain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874125"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nervous system care is the new winter fitness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase slipping into everyday talk right now is simple: take care of your nervous system. Not fancy, not flashy, just **winter pacing** in a world that loves the sprint. People are noticing that their mood tracks the basics: light, sleep, warmth, and the tone of their days. Instead of punishing workouts and bulletproof routines, the trend is to create an environment your body recognises as safe. Think morning light, quiet inputs, soft starts. It looks like health, but it feels like home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamal, 34, works hybrid in Manchester and calls it his “calm plan.” He walks to the corner shop at 8:30am just to catch daylight on his face, then answers emails standing near the window. He keeps a wool jumper on the back of his chair and lines up lo-fi playlists for the 4pm dip. Google Trends shows searches for “light therapy” spiking every January, and TikTok keeps surfacing “somatic drills” with millions of views. Jamal swears it isn’t new-age. “It’s just making my body less jumpy,” he laughs, blowing on tea as the kettle clicks again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874126"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this work? Light early in the day nudges your internal clock to stay in rhythm, so energy arrives when you need it and rest lands where it belongs. Warmth, soft sound, and clear edges around work tell your brain, “You’re not in danger,” so it dials down the background alarm. When that hum quiets, emotions get less jagged and choices get kinder. It’s not about hacking biology. It’s about sending steady, repeated “you’re safe” signals, until the winter no longer feels like a fight you’re losing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Micro-habits that actually stick when it’s freezing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try the “10-before-10” ritual. It’s a single, precise action: spend ten minutes outside before 10am, eyes off your phone, even if it’s grey. No steps target, no perfect park, no Lycra. Just face the sky, breathe slowly, and feel your jaw unclench. If it’s bucketing down, stand by the brightest window you can find. Build a tiny cue you can’t ignore — keys on the windowsill, hat by the kettle — and treat it like brushing your teeth. Small, automatic, done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874128"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common mistake: turning a winter reset into an Olympic sport. You draw a 30-step routine and crash by day three, then blame yourself for being human. Go smaller. Two minutes of movement while the toast browns. Three lines of journalling on a sticky note. One call to a friend on your walk home. Let’s be honest: no one really does that every day. Aim for “four days out of seven” and call the wins what they are — **micro-joys** that stack. You’ll notice it on the days you don’t do them. That’s the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how one therapist framed it to me — think tone, not trophies. Start light, keep it repeatable, and build warmth into the bones of your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Winter isn’t asking you to be stronger. It’s asking you to be steadier. Choose rituals that make your body feel safe, and your mind will follow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use “first light, first sip”: step into daylight with your first coffee or tea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make “two-sentence journal” your rule: one feeling, one next step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find **gentle accountability**: a friend, a Slack check-in, or a calendar emoji.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a “warm kit”: hat, gloves, hand-warmer by the door for no-excuse minutes outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower noise: one news check at lunch, mute all but three chats till 10am.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-type="_mgwidget" data-widget-id="1874129"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Connection, meaning, and the soft social reboot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter 2025 isn’t just about you and your morning light. The deeper trend is tiny, dependable togetherness. Micro-gatherings over grand plans. Soup clubs where neighbours rotate one pan a week. Body-doubling Zooms where cameras are half-off and productivity is caught, not forced. A monthly “bring one thing you baked” circle where nobody judges the supermarket brownies. These are small acts with a big echo: they cut through the lonely hum that grows when days are short. If you’re carrying a heavy season, you don’t need another performance. You need a place to stand, with someone next to you, where your phone can stay face down and your shoulders drop two inches. Call it *quiet ambition*: less proving, more belonging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Nervous system care&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Feel calmer and steadier within days&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Micro-habits that stick&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;“10-before-10”, two-sentence journalling, tiny movement&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Low effort, high return, easy to repeat&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Soft social reboot&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Micro-gatherings, body-doubling, soup clubs&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Reduce loneliness and build real resilience&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FAQ :&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s one thing I can start this week?&lt;/strong&gt;Do “10-before-10” every weekday. Ten minutes of daylight before 10am — outside if possible, window if not. It’s simple and sets your day’s tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I work nights — does this still apply?&lt;/strong&gt;Shift the light rule to your wake-up time. Get bright light soon after you rise, keep evenings dim, and anchor one tiny ritual at the same point in your shift.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I stop doomscrolling first thing?&lt;/strong&gt;Move social apps to the second screen and put a single photo widget by your alarm. Open the front door for a breath before you open a feed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if I hate group stuff?&lt;/strong&gt;Choose low-key connection: a body-doubling call with one mate, a quiet library hour, or a monthly swap of playlists. Belonging can be quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this a replacement for therapy or meds?&lt;/strong&gt;No. These trends support wellbeing but aren’t treatment. If you’re struggling, speak to a professional or your GP and use these as kind add-ons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bike helmets may seem like a faff, but just buckle up, says Dr Sabine Donnai, a physician and founder of &lt;a href="https://viavi.com/" data-trackable="link"&gt;Viavi&lt;/a&gt;, a health clinic that offers brain mapping and cognitive tests. “Closed head injuries can have an impact on the blood-brain barrier,” she says, referring to the protective layer of cells that prevents harmful substances from entering the brain. “Once it is compromised, toxins, drugs and viruses have free entry to our brain and very often result in ‘brain fog’ or longer-term cognitive decline.” And helmets are becoming more portable. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a4e03c0d-dcf4-4acb-8c85-f1c48f704490" data-trackable="link"&gt;Ventete&lt;/a&gt; has created the world’s first inflatable bike helmet, and UK brand &lt;a href="https://wearenewlane.com/" data-trackable="link"&gt;Newlane&lt;/a&gt; makes a foldable helmet that meets European safety standards and folds to half its size to slip into a bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ab3f2e488-bb68-4420-b2db-8d81cfb9750d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Ab3f2e488-bb68-4420-b2db-8d81cfb9750d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fb3f2e488-bb68-4420-b2db-8d81cfb9750d.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newlane foldable bike helmet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£89.99&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wearenewlane.com/products/flip-clip-helmet" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;2. Protect your heart&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Masud Husain, professor of neurology and cognitive neuroscience at the University of Oxford and author of &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9c2bcb2-fc42-4cd4-9d10-ef798d09a7f2" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Brains, Our Selves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “people don’t realise that high blood pressure makes a big difference to their brain health”. Get regular health checks to keep tabs on your vascular health – blood pressure, BMI, blood sugar and cholesterol – or at the very least employ a home-use blood-pressure monitor to ensure that blood pressure is consistently below 135/85 (the British Heart Foundation recommends devices by Omron). And as a baseline, aim for around two and a half hours of moderate-intensity activity – such as running, cycling or brisk walking – each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A84776b42-ff47-4365-a7a7-e2e6df5d1da5?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A84776b42-ff47-4365-a7a7-e2e6df5d1da5?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F84776b42-ff47-4365-a7a7-e2e6df5d1da5.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omron M2 Plus blood pressure monitor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop.bhf.org.uk/omron-m2-plus-blood-pressure-monitor-with-22-42cm-cuff" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;3. Eat a colourful range of foods &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut-brain axis is well established. “Your intestinal microbes produce neuroactive compounds that impact everything from cognition to mood,” says Olga Donica, nutritionist and longevity innovation director at &lt;a href="https://www.cliniquelaprairie.com/" data-trackable="link"&gt;Clinique La Prairie&lt;/a&gt;. “A practical start is to consume fermented foods and a range of colourful plants each day.” Diversity is great, agrees Donnai. “Eat a massive variety of whole foods: spices and herbs, in particular turmeric, ginger, garlic and cinnamon, and healthy fats [salmon, avocado, olive oil, mackerel and sardines].” An easy add is Newroad 30, a powdered supplement containing 30 freeze-dried organic fruits and vegetables that can be sprinkled on yoghurt or incorporated into a drink. Refined sugar and ultra-processed foods are not encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A981dcc78-240f-4ef7-b085-08df655185d5?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F981dcc78-240f-4ef7-b085-08df655185d5.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="n-content-picture__caption o3-editorial-typography-caption"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;© Fisher Studios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newroad 30 supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£45 for a 30-day supply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newroad.life/products/newroad-30" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;4. Embrace calm &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain thrives on stimulation, but also restoration,” says Donica. “Meditation, even for five minutes twice a day, regulates the autonomic nervous system, reduces cortisol and activates neuroprotective pathways.” If this isn’t for you, a simple path to the parasympathetic “rest and relax” state is to find something fun to do – and think about writing it down (the Five Minute Journal has fill-in-the-blank sections so you can note what you are grateful for each day). “Gratitude journalling and laughter are super-useful to de-stress and flood our brains with positive hormones,” says Donnai. “Neuroplasticity is enhanced, mood improves through increased serotonin and dopamine release and focus is increased.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A3c65645b-302e-4e8d-827d-3ebfd8c72c8d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A3c65645b-302e-4e8d-827d-3ebfd8c72c8d?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F3c65645b-302e-4e8d-827d-3ebfd8c72c8d.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Five Minute Journal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.intelligentchange.com/products/the-five-minute-journal" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;5. Learn a new skill&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Murali Doraiswamy, professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences and director of the neurocognitive disorders programme at Duke University School of Medicine, the best way to keep your brain sharp is the “lifelong pursuit of mentally stimulating and challenging activities”. While he’d suggest you push retirement off as long as possible in order to keep the brain challenged in a wide variety of demanding ways, alternatives include anything from competitive bridge to walking book clubs (that’s the discussion of books – while walking). The key is to try things that you find difficult. If you are a whizz at sudoku, for example, then consider something more physical, such as tango; if your comfort zone is numbers, perhaps try to write some poetry. “Greater cognitive stimulation enhances brain size and resilience to pathology,” says Doraiswamy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;6. Detoxify your life &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class="n-content-pullquote o3-editorial-typography-pullquote n-content-pullquote--no-image" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxins are stored in fatty tissues like our brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are exposed to microplastics, pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals and so forth every day,” says Donnai. “In combination, our detoxification pathways are overwhelmed and this results in storing toxins – mainly in fatty tissues like our brain.” What to do? Avoid toxins where you can: some studies suggest you should drink filtered water (look to brands like &lt;a href="https://aquatru.co.uk/" data-trackable="link"&gt;AquaTru&lt;/a&gt; for reverse osmosis, or &lt;a href="https://water2.com/" data-trackable="link"&gt;Water2&lt;/a&gt; for an easy under-sink filter) and try to avoid heating plastics (don’t drink your coffee, for instance, through a black plastic lid, or microwave food in a plastic container). If you’re concerned about the chemicals in the coatings on non-stick pans, swap them for cast iron or stainless-steel alternatives; and check the labels on your clothing and bedding: natural fibres won’t shed microplastics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;7. Test your hearing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are linking hearing loss with reduced brain health. Husain says: “The greater the level of hearing loss, the higher the risk of dementia; exactly why this is the case is not established, but it might be through increased social isolation or less intellectual stimulation [caused by missing out in conversations].” People with hearing loss who use hearing aids have a lower risk of cognitive decline, so getting your hearing tested is recommended if you have any concerns. Last year, Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/83b7416d-9f5b-471e-b402-15f1ce57fa25" data-trackable="link"&gt;a hearing-aid feature&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/" data-trackable="link"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; 2 (take a five-minute test, and if the test detects mild-to-moderate hearing loss, the earphones can boost certain frequencies, for example, when listening to someone speaking against a noisy backdrop).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Aa28b74c5-9088-4d5e-a050-a12eeaa412d1?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Aa28b74c5-9088-4d5e-a050-a12eeaa412d1?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3Aa28b74c5-9088-4d5e-a050-a12eeaa412d1?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2Fa28b74c5-9088-4d5e-a050-a12eeaa412d1.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple AirPods Pro 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£219&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/airpods-pro/" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3 class="n-content-heading-3 o3-editorial-typography-subheading"&gt;8. Go to bed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep is not simply rest, it’s a biological imperative for cognitive function and long-term brain health,” explains Donica. “It’s foundational to brain performance and emotional regulation. Aim for between seven and eight hours each night, and support your circadian rhythm by avoiding late-night meals, alcohol and screen time.” Some research suggests blue light can cause melatonin levels to drop, so blue-light-reducing sunglasses could help you drift off more quickly (try a pink-tinted pair from &lt;a href="https://victoriousbeings.com/" data-trackable="link"&gt;Loving Victorious Beings&lt;/a&gt;, £196), and consider supporting your sleep with magnesium (see &lt;a href="https://betteryou.com/products/magnesium-flakes" data-trackable="link"&gt;BetterYou&lt;/a&gt;’s bath flakes, £5.49, or Verden’s Nocturne Magnesium Night Balm, £30). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout" data-layout-name="card" data-layout-width="full-width"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__container"&gt;&lt;div class="n-content-layout__slot"&gt;&lt;figure class="n-content-image n-content-image--full" data-component="image-set"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A50a79114-3abf-483e-a8e7-dbf443a4a978?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1 1x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A50a79114-3abf-483e-a8e7-dbf443a4a978?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=2 2x,https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/ftcms%3A50a79114-3abf-483e-a8e7-dbf443a4a978?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=3 3x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.ft.com/v3/image/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net%2Fproduction%2F50a79114-3abf-483e-a8e7-dbf443a4a978.png?source=next-article&amp;amp;fit=scale-down&amp;amp;quality=highest&amp;amp;width=700&amp;amp;dpr=1" alt="" data-image-type="image" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verden Nocturne magnesium night balm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;£30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://verden.world/products/nocturne-magnesium-night-balm" data-trackable="link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Financial Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 05:00:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE53R2JRMHJmTWplVDRaaWVIZi1tMUxhNnBYWlNaMkJhYWhpa203V2d2MlBFVXJMV1JWa3ZjWGVWQXJ3akVZWDZEYXY2UkxzUExOODlWOHNISUIya184S1VZcnd2bDNQUFdUaC1admpQeFM</guid></item><item><title>普拉提教练说，仅通过这三个无设备的锻炼，您就可以变得更强壮- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/pilates/a-pilates-instructor-says-you-can-get-stronger-over-40-with-just-these-three-equipment-free-exercises</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

Also called colorectal cancer, the disease occurs when abnormal cells form in the colon or rectum and can spread to other organs if not detected early. Though it has long been considered a condition affecting older adults, doctors are now seeing a worrying increase among younger people, driven by sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary habits. Data from the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/colorectal-cancer?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (WHO) shows that colon cancer accounted for over 1.9 million new cases and nearly 930,000 deaths worldwide in 2020, underscoring its global health impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the value of prevention, Dr Saurabh Sethi, MD, MPH, a gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, recently shared an informative post on Instagram. He explained that eating foods high in fibre, antioxidants, and probiotics can help reduce inflammation, support gut health, and significantly lower the risk of developing colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Five Effective Ways to Detoxify Your Gut Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;10 everyday foods that quietly protect you from colon cancer, according to a gastroenterologist&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d6617?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in The BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a diet high in whole grains and dietary fibre can significantly lower the risk of colon cancer. Researchers found that individuals who regularly consumed fibre-rich foods such as oats, barley, beans, and lentils had improved digestion, reduced inflammation in the colon, and a healthier gut microbiome, all of which contribute to cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-020-00556-6?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in the Nutrition Journal (BioMed Central)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; reported that regular intake of whole grains was linked to an 11% reduction in colon cancer risk, highlighting how a fibre-rich diet supports colon health by promoting the removal of toxins and maintaining regular bowel movements. These findings reinforce the importance of choosing unprocessed, plant-based foods to quietly protect the colon over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beans and lentils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beans, lentils, and other legumes are rich in dietary fibre, which supports healthy digestion and helps sweep out toxins from the intestines. Fibre reduces the time spent in the colon, lowering the chances of cell damage or inflammation that can lead to cancer. These foods are also high in plant-based proteins and resistant starch, which nourish beneficial gut bacteria. When gut microbes ferment these starches, they produce short-chain fatty acids like butyrate, known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Broccoli and cruciferous vegetables&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts are part of the cruciferous vegetable family, famous for their detoxifying effects. They contain sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol, compounds that help neutralise harmful carcinogens and support liver function. Studies suggest that people who regularly consume cruciferous vegetables may have a lower risk of colorectal cancer due to their ability to regulate inflammation and protect DNA from oxidative damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Berries&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries are packed with antioxidants such as anthocyanins, ellagic acid, and vitamin C. These compounds help fight oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in the colon lining. Berries also support healthy cell regeneration and can inhibit the growth of cancerous cells. Adding a small bowl of mixed berries to your breakfast or smoothie is an easy way to harness their benefits daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oats, barley, and quinoa&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whole grains like oats, barley, and quinoa are excellent sources of soluble fibre and beta-glucans, which improve gut health and promote regular bowel movements. A high-fibre diet can dilute potential carcinogens in the digestive tract and support beneficial bacteria. These grains also help maintain a healthy weight and regulate blood sugar, both important factors for reducing cancer risk. Swapping refined grains with whole ones can make a long-term difference in digestive and metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Leafy greens&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinach, kale, lettuce, and other leafy greens provide chlorophyll, folate, and carotenoids, compounds that help repair DNA and protect cells from damage. Folate, in particular, supports healthy cell division and reduces the risk of mutations that can lead to cancer. Including a variety of greens in your meals not only adds fibre but also boosts your intake of vitamins A, C, and K, which enhance immunity and detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Garlic&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garlic is rich in sulphur-containing compounds such as allicin, which have been linked to reduced cancer risk. These compounds can help inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria, enhance immune function, and slow the spread of abnormal cells. Regular consumption of fresh garlic, whether raw, roasted, or added to meals, supports both digestive and cardiovascular health while providing anti-inflammatory protection to the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Onions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like garlic, onions belong to the Allium family and contain flavonoids and organosulphur compounds that have protective effects against colon cancer. They help detoxify the body and reduce inflammation in the intestinal lining. Onions also promote the growth of good bacteria in the gut, supporting a healthy microbiome, an important factor in preventing colon and other digestive cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tomatoes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomatoes are abundant in lycopene, a red pigment and potent antioxidant that may lower cancer risk by protecting cells from oxidative stress. Cooking tomatoes enhances lycopene absorption, making tomato sauces, soups, and curries excellent additions to your diet. Alongside lycopene, tomatoes contain vitamin C and potassium, which contribute to overall digestive and heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Yoghurt and fermented foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probiotic-rich foods such as yoghurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut contain beneficial bacteria that promote gut balance. A healthy microbiome strengthens the intestinal barrier, reduces inflammation, and improves immune response. Research has shown that regular intake of probiotics can lower the risk of colon cancer by suppressing the growth of harmful bacteria and supporting nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nuts and seeds&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are nutrient-dense foods high in fibre, omega-3 fatty acids, and antioxidants. These nutrients help regulate inflammation, lower cholesterol levels, and protect colon cells from oxidative damage. Nuts and seeds also promote satiety and stable blood sugar, both essential for maintaining a healthy body weight and reducing cancer risk. A handful of mixed nuts or a spoon of ground flaxseed can be an easy, powerful addition to your daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi’s advice serves as a timely reminder that small, consistent dietary choices can have a powerful impact on long-term health. While medical screenings and lifestyle habits are essential, a diet rich in fibre, antioxidants, and probiotics provides the foundation for colon protection. Making these foods a regular part of your meals can help strengthen your digestive system, lower inflammation, and reduce the risk of colon cancer, quietly, one bite at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Osteoporosis, or the "silent bone disease," thins bones slowly and makes them more susceptible to breakage. Since it does so without overt early signs, most people find out about the condition only after a fracture has been sustained. There are however tell-tale signs our body provides—particularly in our hands, legs, and teeth—that point towards hidden bone weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a physician, I think that awareness of these signs is important. Early detection of osteoporosis can be treated well so it does not lead to disability and enhances quality of life. Let us examine six significant signs you should not overlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency: Doctor explains causes,  symptoms and prevention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Repeated fracture of wrist or hand&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wrist and small bones of the hand are often the first sites where osteoporosis reveals itself. A minor fall, something as simple as trying to catch yourself when tripping, can cause a fracture if bones have lost density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; • Why it happens: The bones in the forearm (radius and ulna) and the small carpal bones are vulnerable when weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Telltale sign: If you break a bone from a low-impact accident—something that wouldn't usually fracture a healthy bone—it could be an early warning sign of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blowing off repeated fractures to the hand or wrist is risky, as they indicate systemic bone weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Grip weakening and stiffness of hands&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weakening grip is more than a reflection of age. Studies indicate that grip strength has a high correlation with overall bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Why it occurs: Weakened muscle support and poor bones in the hand limit functional strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Warning indicator: Inability to open jars, lift grocery bags, or grasp objects firmly can indicate hidden osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weakened grip should not only be addressed with hand exercises but also with a bone health assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Hip and leg pain or sudden fractures&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hip is among the most frequent and perilous locations of osteoporotic fractures. Likewise, shin bone or thigh bone fractures following minor injuries are not typical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Why it occurs: Osteoporosis diminishes bone density in load-bearing bones like the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and hip joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Warning signal: Recurring leg pain without obvious injury, or a fracture after a simple slip, must be evaluated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hip fractures, specifically, can seriously limit mobility and independence, particularly among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Tapering height and bent legs&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis tends to affect the spine but also shows changes in the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; • Why it occurs: Progressive micro-fractures in the vertebrae lead to spinal compression. This affects the body's equilibrium and results in abnormal stress on the legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Warning sign: Clear shortening of stature, bent legs, or bowed legs should not be attributed to mere "old age."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes signal advanced bone thinning and structural compromise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Receding gums and loose teeth&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jawbone is also impacted by osteoporosis. Dental health thus offers early indications of bone density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; • Why it occurs: Bone loss in the jaw diminishes support for gums and teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Warning sign: Receding gums, loose teeth, or ill-fitting dentures can all be attributed to poor bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dentists usually detect early indicators of osteoporosis during regular dental appointments. Oral health should therefore never be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Brittle toenails and foot problems&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not as often talked about, the feet can also be an indicator of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Why it occurs: Weakened bone in the little bones of the feet puts one at risk for stress fractures. Weak connective tissues and low mineral content can also impair nail strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;•Sign of warning: Brittle toenails, painful feet with frequent use, or stress fractures with short-distance walking can be a sign of underlying bone disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are usually ignored but may be crucial indicators of systemic bone weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why these symptoms are significant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these signs—delicate hands, weakened grip, hip or leg fracture, change in posture, dental problem, brittle feet—looks insignificant individually. Collectively, however, they paint a distinct picture of potential osteoporosis. Catching them early provides room for early medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you identify with these signs, then what do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you observe any of the aforementioned signs, you are encouraged to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; 1. Seek the advice of a doctor: Orthopaedic or endocrinology experts are able to advise on assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Obtain a DEXA scan: This checks bone mineral density and verifies diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Monitor nutrition levels: Calcium and vitamin D deficiency are reversible causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Make bone-friendly lifestyle changes: Weight-bearing exercise, cessation of smoking, reduction of alcohol use, and a healthy diet slow disease progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Medical therapy may be considered: Based on severity, medications like bisphosphonates, denosumab, or hormone therapy can be prescribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overlooking common wrist fractures, grip weakness, hip or leg pains, decreasing height, receding gums, or brittle toenails can be expensive.

        &lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the world’s most urgent health challenges, with the WHO’s recent report showing there are “too few antibacterials in the pipeline” and the limited commercial incentives deter investment in antibiotic discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methylenomycins (methylenomycin A and B) are antibiotic compounds—produced by the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/em&gt; A3—that are cyclopentanone derivatives. They are effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_3" data-render-ad="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;American Chemical Society&lt;/em&gt; entitled, “Discovery of Late Intermediates in Methylenomycin Biosynthesis Active against Drug-Resistant Gram-Positive Bacterial Pathogens,” researchers report on a new antibiotic pre-methylenomycin C lactone—an intermediate chemical in the natural process that produces methylenomycin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Methylenomycin A was originally discovered 50 years ago and while it has been synthesized several times, no one appears to have tested the synthetic intermediates for antimicrobial activity,” notes Greg Challis, PhD, professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, and Biomedicine Discovery Institute at Monash University. “By deleting biosynthetic genes, we discovered two previously unknown biosynthetic intermediates, both of which are much more potent antibiotics than methylenomycin A itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tested for antimicrobial activity, one of the intermediates, pre-methylenomycin C lactone, was shown to be over 100 times more active against diverse Gram-positive bacteria than the original antibiotic methylenomycin A.&lt;/p&gt;

The new precursors, especially pre-methylenomycin C lactone, show increased potency against Gram-positive bacterial pathogen compared to the original methylenomycin A. [Greg Challis/University of Warwick]&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it was shown to be effective against &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/em&gt;, the bacterial species behind MRSA and VRE respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Remarkably, the bacterium that makes methylenomycin A and pre-methylenomycin C lactone—&lt;em&gt;Streptomyces coelicolor&lt;/em&gt;—is a model antibiotic-producing species that’s been studied extensively since the 1950s. Finding a new antibiotic in such a familiar organism was a real surprise,” notes Lona Alkhalaf, PhD, assistant professor, University of Warwick. “It looks like &lt;em&gt;S. coelicolor&lt;/em&gt; originally evolved to produce a powerful antibiotic (pre-methylenomycin C lactone), but over time has changed it into methylenomycin A—a much weaker antibiotic that may play a different role in the bacterium’s biology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers could not detect any emergence of resistance to pre-methylenomycin C lactone in &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt; bacteria under conditions where vancomycin resistance is observed. Vancomycin is a “last line” treatment for &lt;em&gt;Enterococcus&lt;/em&gt; infection, so this finding is especially promising for VRE, a WHO High Priority Pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step in the development of the antibiotic will be pre-clinical testing. In a coordinated publication earlier this year in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Organic Chemistry&lt;/em&gt;, the work reported on a scalable synthesis of pre-methylenomycin C lactone, paving the way for further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This discovery suggests a new paradigm for antibiotic discovery,” Challis asserts. “By identifying and testing intermediates in the pathways to diverse natural compounds, we may find potent new antibiotics with more resilience to resistance that will aid us in the fight against AMR.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemists from the University of Warwick and Monash University have discovered a promising new antibiotic that shows activity against drug-resistant bacterial pathogens, including MRSA and VRE&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the world's most urgent health challenges, with the WHO's &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2025-who-releases-new-reports-on-new-tests-and-treatments-in-development-for-bacterial-infections" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; showing there are 'too few antibacterials in the pipeline." Most of the 'low-hanging fruit' has already been found, and the limited commercial incentives deter investment in antibiotic discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/10.1021/jacs.5c12501" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the Monash Warwick Alliance Combating Emerging Superbug Threats Initiative have discovered a promising new antibiotic—pre-methylenomycin C lactone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly discovered antibiotic was "hiding in plain sight"—as an intermediate chemical in the natural process that produces the well-known antibiotic methylenomycin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-lead author of the study, Professor Greg Challis, in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Warwick, and Biomedicine Discovery Institute at Monash University says, "Methylenomycin A was originally discovered 50 years ago and while it has been synthesized several times, no-one appears to have tested the synthetic intermediates for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/antimicrobial+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antimicrobial activity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By deleting biosynthetic genes, we discovered two previously unknown biosynthetic intermediates, both of which are much more potent antibiotics than methylenomycin A itself."&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;When tested for antimicrobial activity, one of the intermediates, pre-methylenomycin C lactone, was shown to be over 100 times more active against diverse Gram-positive bacteria than the original antibiotic methylenomycin A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, it was shown to be effective against S. aureus and E. faecium, the bacterial species behind Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-lead author Dr. Lona Alkhalaf, Assistant Professor, University of Warwick adds, "Remarkably, the bacterium that makes methylenomycin A and pre-methylenomycin C lactone—Streptomyces coelicolor—is a model antibiotic-producing species that's been studied extensively since the 1950s.

Vancomycin is a "last line" treatment for Enterococcus infection, so this finding is especially promising for VRE, a WHO High Priority Pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Challis continues, "This discovery suggests a new paradigm for antibiotic discovery. By identifying and testing intermediates in the pathways to diverse natural compounds, we may find potent new antibiotics with more resilience to resistance that will aid us in the fight against AMR."&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The next step in the development of the antibiotic will be pre-clinical testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a coordinated publication earlier this year in the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.joc.5c01179?ref=PDF" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Organic Chemistry&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a team led by Monash, collaborating with the Warwick team, reported a scalable synthesis of pre-methylenomycin C lactone, paving the way for further research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor David Lupton, School of Chemistry, Monash University, who led the synthesis work, says, "This synthetic route should enable the creation of diverse analogs that can be used to probe the structure−activity relationship and mechanism of action for pre-methylenomycin C lactone. The Center to Impact AMR at Monash gives us a great platform to take this promising antimicrobial forward."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its simple structure, potent activity, difficult to resist profile, and scalable synthesis, pre-methylenomycin C lactone represents a promising new candidate that could potentially help to save some of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" target="_blank"&gt;1.1 million&lt;/a&gt; people who are the victims of AMR every year.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Scientists have found blood protein signals that may flag multiple sclerosis up to seven years before symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spotting early warning signs means more opportunities to treat or prevent &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS) – and more insight into how it develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chronic, incurable &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/4-out-of-5-autoimmune-patients-are-female-the-x-chromosome-could-explain-why"&gt;autoimmune disease –&lt;/a&gt; where the immune system attacks the brain and spinal cord – can cause a range of debilitating health issues – including problems with memory, mobility, vision, mood, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time symptoms appear, the disease can already be well established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-specific-bacteria-linked-to-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;Scientists Identify Specific Bacteria Linked to Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study led by researchers from the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), evidence of brain damage was detected years before symptom onset – potentially a crucial window for earlier &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-trial-gives-new-hope-for-treating-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; and support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think our work opens numerous opportunities for diagnosing, monitoring, and possibly treating MS," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/10/430921/how-multiple-sclerosis-harms-brain-long-symptoms-appear"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Ahmed Abdelhak, from UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be a game-changer for how we understand and manage this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team analyzed data from blood samples given by US military personnel, 134 of whom later developed MS. More than 5,000 proteins were studied to see whether early patterns appeared at significant rates among this subgroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found levels of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myelin_oligodendrocyte_glycoprotein"&gt;myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein&lt;/a&gt; (MOG) jumped up sharply a full seven years before symptoms began, on average. Because MOG helps protect the nervous system's wiring, the finding implies that protective layers are under attack long before clinical disease appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around six years before symptoms, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/neurological/depts/multiple-sclerosis/ms-approaches/neurofilament-light-chain"&gt;neurofilament light chain&lt;/a&gt; (NfL) became more abundant too, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2018-320106"&gt;a recognized sign&lt;/a&gt; of damage to the nervous system. This suggests the disease first attacks the protection around the nervous system, then the nerves themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another protein that was elevated ahead of time was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleukin_3"&gt;interleukin-3&lt;/a&gt; (IL-3), a chemical messenger that recruits immune cells to the parts of the body affected by MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining 21 proteins that showed the strongest early changes, the researchers think an accurate blood test could be developed to flag presymptomatic MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178463" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinChart.jpg" alt="Protein chart" class="wp-image-178463 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/ProteinChart-600x595.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178463" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Certain proteins were at unusually high levels several years ahead of MS symptoms.

These tests were done on blood given by a relatively small number of army recruits, so samples from larger and more diverse groups are needed. The disease won't progress &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-specific-bacteria-linked-to-multiple-sclerosis"&gt;in the same way&lt;/a&gt; or with identical timelines in every individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides early diagnosis tests, the research also gives us useful insight into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ancient-dna-helps-solve-multiple-sclerosis-mystery-in-europe"&gt;the timeline of MS&lt;/a&gt;: which types of damage occur first, and how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that could lead to ways of identifying MS risk factors more precisely, and, potentially, to blocking progression years before typical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now know that MS starts way earlier than the clinical onset, creating the real possibility that we could someday prevent MS – or at least use our understanding to protect people from further injury," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/10/430921/how-multiple-sclerosis-harms-brain-long-symptoms-appear"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Ari Green, from UCSF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04014-w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

His face received full-thickness burns after a speeding drunk driver hit him while he was out cycling with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said he was “lucky to survive” the crash which also damaged his back and pelvis and caused him to break several ribs on one side of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While recovering, he was referred to reconstructive prosthetics, which has opened the Bristol 3D medical centre, the first of its kind in the UK to have 3D scanning, design and printing in a single NHS location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Richards, from Devon, said surgeons tried to save his eye but “they were worried any infection could spread from my eye down the optic nerve to the brain so the eye was removed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The decision was then made to go for free flap, taking tissue with blood arteries and veins and plumbing it into my neck, the flap completely covering the side of my face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He called the process of getting a 3D-printed face “not the most pleasant”. He added: “In the early days of my recovery, I felt very vulnerable, and would not expose myself to social situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It took me a long time to feel comfortable about my image, how I thought people looked at me and what they thought of me – but I have come a long way in that respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Describing the incident that nearly cost him his life, which took place in July 2021, he said: “It was a lovely sunny day, and not long into the ride we were going up a hill on a B road, and this guy comes up behind us at speed, and over the drunk drive limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“He was on his phone, racing up behind us and we were all in line. He wanted to swerve around us, but there was a car coming the other way, so it was either smash into the car or smash into us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Richards said his two friends were hit by the car and thrown clear of it but he became trapped under the vehicle. “[I] was rolled along, with the engine and exhaust burning through one side of my body and the other side being crushed by the car.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said despite his initial “sceptical” feelings towards his treatment, he was happy he had followed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I’m glad I’ve followed this treatment process as it has got me to where I am today. I have always said no matter what treatment is offered, if I think there’s a benefit and the risks aren’t too high, I will try anything and have a go and that’s still the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Amy Davey, the senior reconstructive scientist at North Bristol NHS trust, said: “Surface scanning patients for prosthetics means that patients can be scanned while moving, and this technology can use that movement to aid the prostheses to accommodate movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The 3D printers used involve advanced plastic resins whose properties allow direct application to the skin, with materials that are safe against the skin for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man who struck Richards was sentenced to three years and banned from driving for seven years but it is believed he was released after one and a half years for good behaviour and for pleading guilty from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Richards said: “As you can imagine, I am not best pleased with his reduced sentence as I very nearly lost my life and have to live with all the pain from my injuries on a daily basis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0AFBVV95cUxPdVp4UFN1X3E4bmFYa0FDQXhfYWFkbEphYVBvQjRwOVh3S1dNS1laRmVtRXdJYUc3aXdhbkZsYWpJNk1uRm5DTkh4V1VJYTVoQkpnWlN3WExIOG90V0VXSjMwRVNybnJyN3RoM1pPdE5ROEZ4QXN5NWNrQ2RBdXZhVmJiRHFSUmNta0dReFlhbjdDUVJUdkFfMGUzQXM5SVpwSS1mY1FkdlQxN1pjRXJhc2JvZGxMaGJFZUF1SVdxSzRpN24zaVpldnBUT2t1cHIt</guid></item><item><title>健康图片：研究显示，去艺术画廊可以改善健康状况-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/28/picture-of-health-going-to-art-galleries-can-improve-wellbeing-study-reveals</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Enjoying original works of art in a gallery can relieve stress, reduce the risk of heart disease and boost your immune system, according to the first study of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers measured the physiological responses of participants while viewing masterpieces by world-renowned artists including Manet, Van Gogh and Gauguin in a gallery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They found that art positively influences the immune, hormone and nervous systems all at once – something never previously recorded. The findings suggest that seeing original art not only moves people emotionally, but also calms the body and promotes health and wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study, led by King’s College London, involved 50 people aged between 18 and 40 in the UK. Half viewed original artwork at the Courtauld Gallery in London, while the other half looked at copies of the same paintings in a non-gallery environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The two groups wore sensors that continually measured their heart rates and skin temperature during the 20-minute session, with saliva samples also taken before and after viewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;From these samples, researchers found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol fell by an average of 22% among those viewing original art, compared with just 8% looking at reproductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) linked to stress and a number of chronic diseases fell by 30% and 28% respectively among those in the gallery, with no changes in the other group. This suggests art has a potential calming effect on the body’s inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Tony Woods, a researcher at King’s College London, said: “The research clearly shows the stress-reducing properties of viewing original art and its ability to simultaneously excite, engage and arouse us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Stress hormones and inflammatory markers like cortisol, IL-6 and TNF-alpha are linked to a wide range of health problems, from heart disease and diabetes to anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The fact that viewing original art lowered these markers suggests that cultural experiences may play a real role in protecting both mind and body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study also found that art engages the immune system, the nervous system and the endocrine system, which is responsible for releasing hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Researchers detected signs of excitement among those viewing art in the gallery, including a dip in skin temperature, overall higher heart rates and a variation in heartbeat patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“From a scientific perspective, the most exciting outtake is that art had a positive impact on three different body systems – the immune, endocrine and autonomic systems – at the same time,” Woods said. “This is a unique finding and something we were genuinely surprised to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In short, our unique and original study provides compelling evidence that viewing art in a gallery is good for you and helps to further our understanding of its fundamental benefits. In essence, art doesn’t just move us emotionally – it calms the body too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The emotional intelligence of each person was also assessed before the study using questionnaires but researchers said this had no impact on individual responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jenny Waldman, the director of the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/art" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Art&lt;/a&gt; Fund, which co-funded the study, said: “This study proves for the first time what we’ve long felt at Art Fund – that art really is good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“What’s particularly exciting is that the findings show these benefits are universal – they can be experienced by anyone. We want to encourage everyone to make time to visit their local museum or gallery and experience these powerful effects for themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxPbW9kd21IYld5bnRQckZNYWF1UlJYdXJCUFFMQ296QjNfQk11dThfbW5PTFJXSXo4VUtFUEpnY2wyTHJJRzVjbGR6a3FTSllVblJxVlR3dE5sdFFjM3RHWFhIREtzZTh6ejF4T1VTakFxRWlSWXl2clhMb1FFeG9hclRYTmxIdTFSazEwcmRGcGlIWFlWek40NGEwV3BvLS0wT0U4TE1nYUpid1FKZ080SzZMVmZKb3MwNi1POWxZbmV5dw</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬抓住一只大角猫头鹰，它们立刻变成了好朋友- PetHelpful</title><link>https://pethelpful.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-gets-to-hold-a-great-horned-owl</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PetHelpful</author><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNZEt3aFpuNVIwTUVaaVlNNjNtc1d5T3dBX0RER1lvM2pTNFItajRBY3pBMmdzLXJjYzdhd0k4dGFkTGtOWWNjR0kta291M21LMTdQOEh4bkh6TC05aTBCdWl4cXNqbjBDakNXNUFhek9rc1BLRjZQbzlwRTdSekFoSWdvSURmWTQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
