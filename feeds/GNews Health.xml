Some scientists have even &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11592557/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;called inflammation&lt;/a&gt; “the cause of all diseases”. But what actually causes &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/27/the-truth-about-inflammation-all-you-need-to-know-about-2023s-hottest-health-topic-from-causes-to-cures" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and what fights it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In some contexts, inflammation is good. When the body faces an acute threat – say, an ear infection or a sprained ankle, it responds with acute inflammation – an immune system process marked by fever, swelling and pain in the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"wellness","tags":[{"id":"wellness/wellness","type":"Keyword","title":"Well actually"},{"id":"campaign/email/well-actually","type":"Campaign","title":"Well Actually (Newsletter sign up)"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-lifestyle-and-wellness","type":"Tracking","title":"US lifestyle and wellness"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"global/2025/jul/22/how-to-fight-chronic-inflammation-free","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But in the face of chronic threats – say, from trauma or job stress, acute inflammation can become chronic, and the immune, stress and cardiometabolic responses can become dysregulated. Research links chronic inflammation with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24468642/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;low mood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25123210/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16525580/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cardiovascular risks&lt;/a&gt;, and a range of health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/inflammation-depression-mind-body" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;depression and dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing number of products and routines – like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/19/what-skincare-experts-do-to-their-skin" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;red light masks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/16/cortisol-face-tiktok-cushings-syndrome" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;de-puffing regimens&lt;/a&gt; – claim to fight the signs of inflammation. Many nutritional methods have proven to help chronic inflammation, too – such as eating &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8803482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a vegetable-heavy Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt; or more &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30412134/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3914936/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3-rich fish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/30/inflation-healthy-food-eating-america" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cost &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/18/climate-diet-food-plan" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;access issues&lt;/a&gt; can get in the way of these solutions. Plus, they may not address a major root cause, as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6768696/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5476783/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; says chronic stress can induce chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To prevent and manage chronic stress, more health professionals are offering “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/04/prescribed-time-in-nature-linked-to-improvements-in-anxiety-depression-and-blood-pressure" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;social prescriptions&lt;/a&gt;”, or referrals to non-medical, community-based, de-stressing activities. Often, these activities are free or the costs are covered by another party, like an insurer or local non-profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="32a68415-fe99-4f21-bebf-b11936da351f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":6,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"I tried an anti-inflammatory diet for a week.

But according to Dr Qing Li, professor of clinical medicine at Nippon Medical school in Tokyo, forest bathing can also help support healthy functioning of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a key player in controlling the stress and inflammation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Forest environments can promote relaxation and activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the ‘rest and digest’ functions,” says Dr. Li. It can also reduce activity in the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the “fight or flight” responses. By helping to prevent and manage stress, forest bathing can also help prevent and manage chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36328581/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;series of Li’s studies&lt;/a&gt; show that forest bathing can reduce the stress hormones cortisol, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33066853/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; similarly finds time in nature can reduce physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, and the perception of stress. One &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/a-20-minute-nature-break-relieves-stress?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;found just 20 minutes of nature per day can make a difference in stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="engage-with-art-and-music" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Engage with art and music&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Art can also promote relief from chronic stress. In one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5004743/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, healthy adults who participated in a 45-minute art-making session saw significantly lower levels of cortisol afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Feelings of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/18/truth-about-stress-benefits-of-the-good-kind-exercise-that-makes-it-worse" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;stress are related to a loss of control&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr Girija Kaimal, professor of creative arts therapies at Drexel University, who co-authored the study. Creating art helps us feel like “there’s something we have a sense of agency over” and “lets us take charge of the distress”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study’s participants self-reported that they found art-making relaxing, enjoyable, “freeing from constraints”, and conducive to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/may/08/what-is-flow-psychology" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; and self-discovery. “Distraction is a great initial coping mechanism to help us calm down after a stressful event, but art can help us dig deeper – it helps us pay attention to what distressed us, and it’ll help the next time something similar sets us off,” says Kaimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to create “the kind of art that speaks to you,” says Kaimal – whether it’s writing, dancing, or drawing – and skill level doesn’t matter. “You want to get into a judgment-free zone where you can play and have fun without consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A growing body of research suggests experiencing art, not just creating it, can also promote inflammation reduction. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31167611/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29779734/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found listening to music, for instance, can reduce blood pressure and cortisol. Researchers at the University of Florida have been documenting the &lt;a href="https://arts.ufl.edu/site/assets/files/188411/epiarts_table_final.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health benefits of engaging with the arts&lt;/a&gt;, with some studies suggesting just one to three hours of related activity per week can reduce risk of depression and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective because bodily movement was often linked with fighting a predator or fighting for our lives, says Dr. Michael Gleeson, emeritus professor of exercise biochemistry at Loughborough University. “The body puts its survival first,” and temporarily inhibits the inflammatory response so it can use energy more efficiently, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In his co-authored &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3041" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, Gleeson suggests exercise not only induces an anti-inflammatory environment in the short-term, but may also reduce visceral fat mass in the long-term. The accumulation of visceral fat can drive and worsen chronic inflammation by promoting development of insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and other diseases linked to physical inactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other research finds that exercise can significantly reduce production of &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11332-025-01445-3" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like CRP and IL-6, and increase &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5883991/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;anti-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt;, like IL-10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To reap these and other benefits, the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/337001/9789240014886-eng.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; adults spend at least 150 minutes each week on moderate aerobic activity, like brisk walking and cycling, or 75 minutes on vigorous activity, like running, Zumba or sports. A longitudinal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002561961830538X?utm_source=chatgpt.com" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; finds sports involving social interaction – such as tennis, badminton and soccer – are best at promoting health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="support-other-people" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Support other people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because cooperation with others has historically been essential for survival, our bodies have evolved to respond to the absence of social connections. The &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02699931.2013.837379" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;late neuroscientist Dr John Cacioppo&lt;/a&gt; compares this evolutionary response to hunger. Just as hunger signals the absence of energy and nutrients and cues the body to find food, loneliness signals the absence of social connections, and cues us to seek out or repair relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That’s why multiple studies link feelings of loneliness and social isolation to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5130107/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;range of stress responses&lt;/a&gt;, including increased &lt;a href="https://pure.johnshopkins.edu/en/publications/getting-under-the-skin-social-isolation-and-biological-markers-in" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pro-inflammatory proteins&lt;/a&gt; and dysregulated &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19744794/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cortisol&lt;/a&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Conversely, studies link &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15473629/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high levels of social support &lt;/a&gt;to lower cortisol, and link social activities like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4229892/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;volunteering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036113/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;giving social support&lt;/a&gt; to lower pro-inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="experience-awe" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Experience ‘awe’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Within all of these activities, the experience of awe – a feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends our current understanding of the world – can also reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Jennifer Stellar, a professor of psychology at University of Toronto, co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25603133/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that links awe to greater positive affect and lower inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Further research is underway but Stellar suggests “that positive emotions can undo the effects of negative emotions, and negative emotions are associated with inflammation”. Another reason is that “awe makes us feel connected to others, and social connection has been documented to act as a buffer against inflammatory responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;So how can you encounter awe? Her co-author, Dr Dacher Keltner, a professor of psychology at University of Berkeley California and renowned awe expert, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/may/02/awe-psychology-life-death-dacher-keltner" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that it can result from engagement with the “eight wonders of life”: the moral beauty of others, nature, collective movement, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, big ideas, and the cycle of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPR3lYaFpRWTRfZnhaUnRhdU9FbExTQXRhN3VKOWR2M2U4YTNjUkdGUzdaREo1U2wzVE5fYURXTUVFelRObGlnOWxaZWJJV1ZDM05tbFpBRXdnQ1IzZkxaM2lCbTJOeUN5RzF4aFNINVpMVmU1cEZJS0xJNGR5R1ZJQWdpWHg1TWg4TUhHc2lR</guid></item><item><title>性建议：我看到的那个男人在床上解放了我。现在，这将是我们的垮台。- Slate Magazine | Sex advice: The man I'm seeing liberated me in bed.

I love the content, advice, and inspiration it provides me. I am writing in for help with a problem I am having. My rational side knows the answer, but my emotional side will not get with the program.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rr8f00183b77f93x85fd@published"&gt;I am female and my partner is male. We began our relationship hot and heavy. He reawakened in me a connection with my sexual self that has been powerful and liberating. I am in my mid-40s, perimenopausal, and still I WANT to have sex as often as possible because of how good it feels to be desired and connected to a man that I love.  We have been very adventurous. I have a vivid imagination and fantasize and masturbate regularly. I always prefer him. Here is the problem…&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="83" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rram00193b77dm16bz7w@published"&gt;His libido is vanishing. He is also in his 40s. He has an incredibly stressful job, custody troubles, substance abuse, and past sexual trauma. He is a complicated, yet simple man, and we love each other very much. I communicate endlessly about his diminishing initiative to be intimate and how it makes me feel. This then turns into him feeling guilt and shame for not being able to provide what I need, and he worries I will leave him for someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="201" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd9mgfku000b3b7820xbz79a@published"&gt;He is finally taking erectile dysfunction medication, but he seems to never be in the mood to initiate. I feel like I am badgering him. I know he is tired and stressed, but he is so sexy to me that I want him ALL the time, and the pressure I put on him only makes it worse. I try to tell him that I don’t need his penis to work for me to be sexually satisfied. I just need him to want me the way he used to. He says he will go to therapy with me, but not alone. We talk about our relationship issues, but he is exhausted by the fact that it always comes back to sex and my constant need for it. Non-monogamy is not really for us (although we have discussed my fantasy of bringing another male to the bedroom). I know I need to back off and give him some grace. It is his body, and I need to learn how to be patient. Still, my feelings of rejection and neglect are overwhelming sometimes. How can I reconcile my understanding of what he is physically/mentally going through with my overwhelming feelings of hurt and frustration?&lt;/p&gt;

He probably does want, on some level, to want you the way he used to. You’re absolutely correct that patience, space, and grace are the best way to create conditions that are conducive to your partner feeling desire toward you. You know that men often deal with feelings of inadequacy around erectile dysfunction, and may have a hard time with their libido being lower than they feel it should be or than it used to be. And you’re aware that most of us worry, at some point, about whether our partners might leave us.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrlx001d3b77zlzk5vhc@published"&gt;As an aside, absolutely do not pursue bringing in a third partner at this time. It’s too combustible. Even discussing the fantasy has a chance of adding more shame and pressure to what your partner is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rroa001e3b77u6nmbhpe@published"&gt;Are you sure that the neglect you’re feeling is entirely related to sex? Your partner is juggling a lot, and I’m wondering whether you’ve perhaps enjoyed the sexual liberation you describe so thoroughly that you may not have noticed intimacy, connection, and support being somewhat absent in other areas. So take a long, sober look at the relationship. Do you get the amount of touch you need outside of sex? Is he emotionally available to a degree that is sufficient for you? Do you have ways of connecting outside of physical intimacy?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrqc001f3b77tl8l28dj@published"&gt;If everything else is healthy and happy, what can you do to increase the sexual gratification you get from your solo time? Sometimes this looks like adding props and media—a new vibrator, some different fantasies—and sometimes this looks like a kind of mindful minimalism. Whatever you’re doing right now, explore other directions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrsk001g3b77h73b4v38@published"&gt;As for reconciling what your mind knows with what you feel and what your body wants, therapy is absolutely an option. It may help to simply accept the fact that we sometimes have to hold disparate perspectives. Talking it out with trusted friends is another time-tested way of dealing with difficult feelings. Have a commiseration session—whether you’re all navigating similar hiccups or having different challenges, a group complaint night has a way of helping contextualize what we’re going through.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94rrup001h3b7790eqxj9n@published"&gt;Lastly—and I know this is a wild thing for a sex advice columnist to say to someone who is fairly freshly sexually liberated—it might help to rein in your libido. What can you do to focus on other aspects of life? Or to sit with arousal and desire without letting it run free? This might give you the reprieve you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001s3b77y7zbqgqi@published"&gt;I am a 25-year-old woman who is into being a dom, as it serves as a major turn-on for me. The trouble is that I find that many (if not all) of the guys I go out with are decidedly not keen on the idea of playing the role of a sub. Am I going to have to restrict myself to circles with men who are into being subs if I want to satisfy my kink? Or should I try to see if I can convince someone who isn’t really into it to go along?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7w001v3b77w35kn115@published"&gt;Take a moment to look at your last question: ”convince someone who isn’t really into it.” That’s always a dodgy proposition when we’re talking about sex, and doubly so when the sex involves power exchange, restraint, or pain. Your potential lovers are people who deserve respect, autonomy, and care. Functional BDSM absolutely requires that the submissive’s boundaries and rights be respected—if that isn’t the case, it’s assault or coercion at best, and rape at worst.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="157" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7x001w3b77w417lqpc@published"&gt;When you question whether you’ll have to restrict yourself to circles of men who identify as subs, I imagine you’re wondering whether BDSM clubs and FetLife are your only dating options. While you’ll certainly have a more efficient time finding men who are open to submitting in those spaces, there are other avenues open to you. It’ll help to define what being a dom means to you, and what you’re looking for in a sub. Is this more about psychological role play? Service? Are sadism and masochism part of the equation? What do you need out of the experience to feel satisfied? Let’s say it’s about service—is a defined scenario important? Or will someone whose love language is “acts of service” and loves letting you sit on their face suffice? And does any dynamic need to be pervasive throughout the relationship, present in every sexual and flirtation interaction, or can it be confined to specific sexual moments?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94st7z001x3b77rszlzfv3@published"&gt;Once you’ve got the clarity outlined above, you might look in places like Feeld, which tend to attract people who are, broadly speaking, sexually open. Or attend local events that are marketed as “sex positive” and meet people there. Negotiating relationships with a power dynamic is complex, which is why you’ll need details about exactly what you need to be fulfilled. Be prepared for lots of folks to say, “No, thank you.” That’s part of the reality of dating, whether the detail we’re navigating is a sexual interest, a personality quirk, or the demands of any number of careers. And, if it turns out that your interests are precise and narrow enough that you do essentially need to focus your search in classic BDSM spaces, ask yourself why that feels like confinement.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd94tayb00283b77zpp7uopi@published"&gt;My boyfriend of three months, “Alex,” refuses to go down on me.  He says it’s nothing personal; he’s just never been into performing oral sex.

State the situation plainly: Receiving oral sex is important to your satisfaction, you won’t stay in a relationship where it isn’t part of the sex, and you’re hoping that he’ll be willing to give it a try with you, even though you know he’s never enjoyed it before. Whatever his answer is, accept that and make your choices accordingly with as little turmoil as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol takes around 24 hours to completely leave your body, so you may start noticing improvements after just one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol makes you need to urinate more often, causing dehydration. But your body can absorb a glass of water almost immediately, so once alcohol is out of your system, alcohol dehydration is reduced, improving digestion, brain function and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol also reduces the liver's ability to regulate blood sugar. Once alcohol leaves the system, blood sugar begins to normalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you are a daily drinker you may feel a bit worse to start with while your body adjusts to not having alcohol in its system all the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may initially notice disrupted sleep, mood changes, sweating or tremors. Most symptoms usually resolve in about a week without alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one week &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though alcohol can make you feel sleepy at first, it disrupts your sleep cycle. By the end of an alcohol-free week, you may notice you are more energetic in the mornings as a result of getting better quality sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the body's filter, the liver does much of the heavy lifting in processing alcohol and can be easily damaged even with moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is important for cleaning blood, processing nutrients and producing bile that helps with digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it can also regenerate quickly. If you have only mild damage in the liver, seven days may be enough to reduce liver fat and heal mild scarring and tissue damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even small amounts of alcohol can impair brain functioning. So quitting can help improve brain health within a few days in light to moderate drinkers and within a month even for very heavy dependent drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one month &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can make managing mood harder and worsen symptoms of anxiety and depression. After a few weeks, most people start to feel better. Even very heavy drinkers report better mood after one to two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As your sleep and mood improve you may also notice more energy and greater wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a month of abstinence regular drinkers also report feeling more confident about making changes to how they drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You may lose weight and body fat. Alcohol can trigger hunger reward systems, making us overeat or choose less healthy foods when drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even your skin will thank you. Alcohol can make you look older through dehydration and inflammation, which can be reversed when you quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol irritates the gut and disrupts normal stomach functioning, causing bloating, indigestion, heartburn and diarrhea. These symptoms usually start to resolve within four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One month of abstinence, insulin resistance – which can lead to high blood sugar – significantly reduces by 25 percent. Blood pressure also reduces (by six percent) and cancer-related growth factors declines, lowering your risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It can take up to three days for the body to return to normal functioning following a two-day boozy drinking session, experts say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After six months &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver starts to repair within weeks. For moderate drinkers, damage to your liver could be fully reversed by six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this point, even heavy drinkers may notice they're better at fighting infections and feel healthier overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;After one year or more &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol contributes to or causes a large number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and seven different types of cancer, as well as mental health issues. All of these risks can be reduced by quitting or cutting back on alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol increases blood pressure. High blood pressure (hypertension) is the top risk factor for death in the world. A small 2mmHg increase in blood pressure above the normal range (120mmHG) increases death from stroke by 10 percent and from coronary artery disease by seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting back on alcohol to less than two drinks a day can reduce blood pressure significantly, reducing risk of stroke and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reducing blood pressure also reduces risk of kidney disease, eye problems and even erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With sustained abstinence, your risk of getting any type of cancer drops. One study looked at cancer risk for more than 4 million adults over three to seven years and found the risk of alcohol-related cancer dropped by 4 percent, even for light drinkers who quit. Reducing from heavy to moderate drinking reduced alcohol-related cancer risk by nine percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;This article is adapted from The Conversation, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of experts.

Your drinking is already causing you problems, and you could very well be dependent. You should definitely consider stopping gradually or at least reduce your drinking. You should seek professional help to ascertain the level of your dependence and the safest way to withdraw from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe dependence may need medically assisted withdrawal, or detox, in a hospital or a specialist clinic. This is due to the likelihood of severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms in the first 48 hours needing specialist treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I was a stepmom of two and the primary caretaker of my husband, who is a disabled Veteran of the Marine Corps. He became paralyzed after an injury in 2011.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2021, she went to the doctor after she developed common UTI symptoms. Tests confirmed she had a UTI and her doctor prescribed her an antibiotic called Ciprofloxacin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Before I took the antibiotic, I asked if there was anything I needed to know or be aware of since I didn't take medications and antibiotics often,' Talia explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The response was that there was nothing I needed to be aware of, it was "safe and effective" and that the medication was frequently prescribed at the practice to treat UTIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I trusted my doctor of 10 years so I started my course of treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said the medicine left her in excruciating pain for months, describing it as feeling like 'electrical shocks' were running through her body and 'bugs were crawling' all over her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It also affected her vision and hearing, resulted in her having severe stomach issues, and ultimately left her unable to walk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia explained that after her third dose she began to develop 'pain in her entire body, especially her legs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It felt like I had the flu, when you're whole body hurts, except I wasn't actually sick,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As the day went on, it continued to worsen and I started having tingling and numbness in my extremities. I had zapping pains in my head and face. It was like electrical shocks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It got so bad that she couldn't walk - 'It was like a bomb went off in my body' - so she decided to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After describing her symptoms, the first thing the ER doctor asked her was, 'Are you taking Ciprofloxacin?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ER doctor then explained that the drug she was on had something known as a black box warning from the FDA - the strongest warning the FDA could give, usually for a 'serious or potentially fatal' side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back in 2016, according to the FDA website, the organization 'advised that the serious side effects associated with fluoroquinolone antibacterial drugs [like Ciprofloxacin] generally outweigh the benefits for patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An FDA safety review has shown that fluoroquinolones when used systemically are associated with disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects that can occur together,' its website &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-fda-advises-restricting-fluoroquinolone-antibiotic-use-certain"&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Within five months her condition had become so bad she could hardly eat, and she lost over 50 percent of her body weight, weighing a mere 60 pounds before she was put on hospice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It got so bad that she believed she was going to die after doctors warned that her organs would start failing soon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These side effects can involve the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reaction to the medicine has become known as fluoroquinolone toxicity - according to &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.goodrx.com/classes/quinolone-antibiotics/fluoroquinolone-toxicity?srsltid=AfmBOoqywth-1awJHeX73SQSIQA2mf_fzeqbwayaDRkswRfUyPgFRoxv"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms include 'muscle or joint pain and tendonitis/tendon rupture, nerve damage and twitching, anxiety, depression, hallucinations and memory problems, eye pain, vision loss, ringing in your ears, hearing loss, and loss of smell, and chest pain or skipping heartbeats, known as palpitations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response to the fluoroquinolone toxicity, Talia then developed something called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which is 'an inappropriate activation of the immune system where the body rejects everything, as a form of protection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the months that followed, she said her condition only 'worsened.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was having electrical shocks 24/7, it felt like I had bugs crawling all over my body, horrendous bone and joint pain, debilitating neuropathy, vision and hearing changes, stomach problems, my body was stiffening up, and I was unable to bend in order to sit down,' she shared. 'It felt like my body was in shut down mode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest problem she faced was difficulty swallowing, which made it extremely hard for her to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, she was told by doctors that she would go into organ failure soon because of lack of food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Within five months, I lost over 50 percent of my body weight and went on Hospice, weighing 60 pounds in September 2021,' she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While she has thankfully improved since then, she still requires 24/7 care and is bed-bound - and she doesn't think she'll ever get her old life back&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Flash forward to now, four years after the ordeal first started, and Talia is still living with the effects of the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Before and after: 'I still require 24/7 care for my survival, as I am bed-bound and mainly get up only to go to doctor's appointments in a wheelchair,' she said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She started to believe she was going to die, and even had a priest come to her house and read her her last rites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I truly believed that was the end for me and made peace with it after five months of horrendous suffering,' she said, as she broke down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This was so traumatic for me, listening to my family and friends crying and thinking that would be the last time I ever saw them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Talia's husband wasn't ready to give up, and he 'made it his mission' to get her medication for her MCAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hospitals had previously denied her request but he kept pushing, and eventually, they gave her mast cell stabilizers, which changed everything for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It gave her the ability to eat again, and by May 2022, she was able to leave Hospice and switch to palliative care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flash forward to now, four years after the ordeal first started, and Talia is still living with the effects of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am still on palliative care to this day and require 24/7 care for my survival, as I am bed-bound and mainly get up only to go to doctor's appointments in a wheelchair,' she said. 'I can't do anything by myself. I don't have the strength.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she's still in 'constant pain' and she doesn't think she will ever get back to the way she was before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This has destroyed [me]. &lt;span&gt;I lost my career, my independence, my quality of life,' she confessed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I can only eat five foods because of MCAS, I can't go out and live a "normal" life like everyone else. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I miss working, I miss being able to eat whatever I want, I miss being able to workout, I miss driving, I miss my social life and the life I had with my husband. And there is nothing I can do to get my old life back.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia said she later confronted her doctor about prescribing her the dangerous medication, but claimed was brushed off - and looking back, she feels like the medical system failed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I confronted [my doctor] about the black box warning, the permanent and disabling side effects and how fluoroquinolones should be used as last resort, she told me she was going to continue to prescribe Cipro because she always had and no one else had had a reaction like me,' she shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She is now on a mission to share her story in the hopes that it can stop others from making the same mistake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has launched a petition for the FDA 'to issue informed consent for all fluoroquinolone antibiotic prescriptions,' which has over 3,000 signatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not only did she have a duty to warn me about this dangerous class of antibiotics, but when I asked if there was anything I needed to know, I was told no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additionally, the way she reacted afterwards, by telling me she was going to prescribe Cipro for a UTIs, despite the FDA warnings that I printed and brought to her office, was extremely unprofessional and shows her lack of caring about what happened. I felt very betrayed and abandoned by the medical system.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Talia is currently raising money on her &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-talias-fight-for-health-and-hope"&gt;GoFundMe &lt;/a&gt;page to help cover her medical costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now on a mission to share her story in the hopes that it can stop others from making the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has also launched a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.change.org/p/request-us-fda-to-issue-informed-consent-for-all-fluoroquinolone-antibiotic-prescriptions?utm_medium=custom_url&amp;amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;amp;recruited_by_id=f927e270-521b-11ef-b65c-8d5e1d4f435f"&gt;petition &lt;/a&gt;for the FDA 'to issue informed consent for all fluoroquinolone antibiotic prescriptions,' which has over 3,000 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She concluded, 'If you are prescribed a fluoroquinolone antibiotic as first line, ask for an alternative, if there is one.

collected samples from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, a plant native to tropical and subtropical South America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plant is used to make the sugar substitute Stevia, which can be 50 to 300 times sweeter than sugar and has no calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After fermenting the leaves with Lactobacillus plantarum — the same bacteria used in yogurt and fermented vegetables — the team found fermented Stevia proved effective at killing pancreatic &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a313a6b0-667b-11f0-93ae-09643ae30151"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compared to non-fermented Stevia, fermented varieties (FSLE) destroyed more cells of pancreatic cancer, which kills eight in 10 Americans affected within five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also left healthy cells virtually untouched and neutralized free radicals, which cause harmful inflammation throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Artificial sweeteners like Stevia have long been under fire for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14798029/popular-health-snack-linked-risk-strokes-heart-attacks.html"&gt;being linked to health issues&lt;/a&gt; like strokes, heart disease and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the science on sugar substitutes and alternatives is murky, while decades of research does show the harms of traditional sugar are much clearer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study shows the sweetener Stevia may help stave off pancreatic cancer (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers said the findings could eventually turn the tide for pancreatic cancer, which is on the rise and most often only detected after it has spread throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Narandalai Danshiitsoodol, study co-author and associate professor in the Department of Probiotic Science for Preventive Medicine at Hiroshima University, said: 'Globally, the incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer continue to rise, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10 percent.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, approximately 67,440 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year, and about 51,980 people die from it, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pancreatic cancer is highly invasive and prone to metastasis, meaning it more commonly breaks away from the primary tumor and spreads throughout the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It shows significant resistance to existing treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, thus the need for anti-cancer compounds was sought after in less conventional methods like medicinal plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That’s where Stevia and fermentation comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the International &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/9/4186"&gt;Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, researchers fermented Stevia leaf extract and compared it to unfermented extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The technique is called microbial biotransformation, which has emerged as a valuable technique for improving the efficacy of natural plant extracts. It involves the use of microbial enzymes - bacteria and yeast, for example - to modify bioactive compounds and enhance their potency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stevia turned out to be most potent when fermented for 72 hours, without oxygen, at 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) - the body's natural, healthy temperature. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found Stevia killed pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells more efficiently than the non-fermented extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, it barely touched healthy HEK-293 (healthy) cells, even at high doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The extract also slowed cancer cell growth and made them lose shape, preventing them from sticking together and spreading.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, fermented stevia proved to be a potent antioxidant. Cancer arises from oxidative stress, which damages cells and DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In lab tests the Stevia extract neutralized free radicals more effectively than non fermented varieties, eradicating 94 percent of them in one test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The chart shows survival rates for pancreatic cancer, per the National Cancer Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fermentation likely created new compounds. The researchers suspect chlorogenic acid that is in the original stevia transformed into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME), a more active form. The raw extract had none of this, by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that CAME shut down cancer cells by blocking their cell cycle and making them commit apoptosis, molecular steps that lead to its death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Danshiitsoodol said: 'This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Hiroshima University team plans to study FSLE in mouse models next, which will help determine how well CAME works in a living system and identify safe, effective doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time this could potentially lead to a natural and easy way to combat one of the world's deadliest cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

While these rhythms have long been thought of as stable traits, studies reveal that metabolic state, like fasting before sleep, can enhance their timing and co-occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting in rats boosted the density and synchronization of these sleep rhythms, aligning them for better memory consolidation. These findings suggest sleep’s memory-supporting architecture is more flexible — and modifiable — than previously believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SO-Spindle Coupling:&lt;/strong&gt; Slow oscillations and sleep spindles work in precise timing to stabilize memories during NREM sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Influence:&lt;/strong&gt; Fasting before sleep increased SO and spindle density and improved their coupling in rats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trait and State:&lt;/strong&gt; While sleep rhythms have stable baseline patterns, they can adapt to metabolic and experiential states.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For decades, scientists have marveled at sleep’s mysterious power to strengthen our memories. The human brain, it seems, does some of its most important work while we’re unconscious: replaying, refining, and reinforcing the day’s experiences so they can be stored for the long term. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of this process involves two distinct patterns of brain activity unique to non-REM (NREM) sleep: slow oscillations (SOs) and sleep spindles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111846"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg" alt="This shows a fork and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/fasting-sleep-memory-neuroscienc-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These electrical rhythms—large, slow waves paired with rapid, waxing-and-waning bursts—are thought to synchronize widespread brain regions and promote synaptic plasticity, the foundation of learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, research has zeroed in on a crucial detail: it’s not just the presence of SOs and &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindle-brain-health-28325/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;spindles&lt;/a&gt; that matters, but the precise way they are timed together. This SO-spindle coupling, researchers argue, may be one of sleep’s most essential mechanisms for consolidating memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But is this coupling a fixed feature of an individual’s sleep, like a fingerprint? Or is it flexible—capable of adjusting to recent experiences, such as what you’ve learned that day or even what you’ve eaten? A growing body of work is beginning to suggest the answer is more nuanced than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Rhythm of Memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/nrem-sleep-cognition-28118/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NREM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, your brain cycles through patterns of silence and activity at about one cycle per second. These are the slow oscillations, sweeping waves of hyperpolarization (down states) and depolarization (up states) in the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, the thalamus generates spindles, brief bursts of higher-frequency activity in the 11–16 Hz range. When spindles are precisely timed to the upstate of a slow oscillation, the conditions are ideal for strengthening synaptic connections—a process believed to stabilize memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies have shown that this SO-spindle coupling declines with age and is associated with both memory decline and cognitive impairment. But what about day-to-day variability? Could an unusually rich day of learning, for example, “tune” your brain to couple SOs and spindles more tightly as you sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Testing the Trait vs. State Debate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tackle this question, a research team studied 41 young adults over two nights: one after a word-pair learning task and one control night with no learning. Some participants learned a modest list of 40 word pairs, while others memorized 120, and one group had to meet a minimum recall standard. The researchers measured SO-spindle coupling across these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they found no consistent differences in coupling strength between the learning and control nights—suggesting that pre-sleep learning alone may not significantly influence this aspect of sleep architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, within the group that reached a performance criterion, there was a correlation between memory performance and the &lt;em&gt;phase&lt;/em&gt; of SO-spindle coupling. This finding hints that while coupling may not change dramatically night-to-night, subtle aspects of its timing may still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also uncovered a robust link between the amount of spindle power and the preferred phase of SO-spindle coupling—echoing previous findings that this relationship varies with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results support the idea that SO-spindle coupling may have both trait-like stability (reflecting an individual’s typical sleep structure) and state-dependent fine-tuning influenced by experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond Learning: How Metabolism Shapes Sleep Rhythms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not only learning, what else could shape SO-spindle coupling? One intriguing possibility is metabolic state. Recent work found that individuals with lower fasting glucose levels had stronger and more precise SO-spindle coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This association persisted after controlling for many demographic and health factors, though it disappeared when diabetes status was accounted for—pointing to a complex link between glucose metabolism and sleep oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal experiments provide even more direct evidence. In a study of adult rats, researchers manipulated metabolic state by fasting the animals for six hours before sleep or injecting them with glucose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fasting increased the density of both SOs and spindles, improved their co-occurrence, and shifted spindle timing closer to the upstate of the slow oscillation—an alignment thought to optimize memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glucose injections, meanwhile, increased spindle density but didn’t affect SOs or their coupling. Importantly, these changes occurred without altering the overall amounts of NREM or REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that while age and baseline physiology set the stage, day-to-day factors like nutrition can modulate the fine structure of sleep rhythms, potentially enhancing the brain’s ability to consolidate memories overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Neurochemistry of Sleep Substates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more tantalizing is emerging evidence that NREM sleep itself isn’t uniform, but fluctuates through subtle substates over minutes at a time. These substates, identified in rodent studies, are defined by varying levels of neuromodulators like serotonin, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine—all of which are known to influence memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How these slow neurochemical waves interact with the precise timing of SOs and spindles is still largely unknown, but understanding it could unlock deeper insights into how sleep supports memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reinforce the idea that SO-spindle coupling is a dynamic interplay between stable individual characteristics and flexible state-dependent factors. While your personal sleep architecture likely provides a consistent baseline, it can still adapt—at least subtly—to what you’ve learned, what you’ve eaten, and possibly other yet-unknown variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those looking to optimize their &lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-spindles-blood-sugar-23596/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep for better memory&lt;/a&gt;, this research offers some practical lessons: maintaining healthy metabolic habits may support more effective sleep-based memory consolidation. And it underscores the importance of high-quality sleep itself—not just quantity, but the integrity of its underlying rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research is now needed to uncover the exact circuit-level mechanisms and to explore whether interventions like diet, neuromodulation, or targeted memory reactivation could enhance SO-spindle coupling in meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is far from passive. It’s a highly orchestrated process that relies on the exquisite timing of electrical and chemical signals to reinforce what we’ve learned and prepare us for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By continuing to unravel how slow oscillations and spindles work together—and how they can be tuned by our daily experiences—scientists are bringing us closer to understanding how to make the most of our sleeping hours for our waking minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding:&lt;/strong&gt; This work was supported by Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung, Network for Excellence in Clinical Neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience?&lt;/a&gt; ” by Niels Niethard. &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Sleep EEG—Stable Trait or Shaped by Experience? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of newly encoded memories into long-term storage critically depends on plasticity processes during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is assumed that memory representations are facilitated by repeated reactivation of neuronal firing patterns during sleep, which promotes synaptic plasticity and thereby strengthens memory traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence shows that such memory reactivations occur during specific oscillatory patterns in the EEG that are unique to sleep (Brodt et al. 2023).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:23:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE5HMllJOGF2TUlCeW5vT2xEdWpvamwxOFlzWWdWMS1VdU5KV1J0aHNJVXBmUFFYcU4wcHJBT3JBV04xQ0pOYXJYd0tTY1loLUszcVJKd3pHbW1FZ2V0THpXVXNuamtJNEk</guid></item><item><title>Lizzo认为这种按摩有助于她的身体转变-背后有真正的科学- AOL.com | Lizzo Credits This Type Of Massage For Helping With Her Body Transformation—And There's Real Science Behind It - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qa21pTUhsMWstbXdSRlljMTZkeGlRSFZhVVItamFLaVdPMkJnbU5rMFM1LVRVWXg2RUNHdWpBb2dRRW02NkNydUM0ZHIyY2ZlUDFISy1kN3h4ajNLZDU3cG9nUUZkS1Y2NmgyUHdmUTZZZHN0T1Q1Tg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Lizzo Saw This Beauty Expert To Get Cover Ready&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Getty Images/Flavia Lanini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzo is many things—a singer, a songwriter, an actor, and, now, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a65192751/lizzo-transformation-health-journey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a cover star;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;a cover star&lt;/a&gt;.

She's a regular at Lanini’s eponymous Beauty Institute in Beverly Hills, indulging in her signature detox treatment once or twice weekly. The results speak for themselves, as seen in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLq4AAvRTD_/?img_index=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:before and after;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;before and after&lt;/a&gt; phot0 posted to Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, it all comes to down to Lizzo’s dedication and effort—and their ongoing relationship. “I always tell my clients that they really need to trust in the process and trust &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. If that happens, I can deliver results—and I’m so happy with Lizzo’s results,” she says. “We took a different approach to weight loss than she ever had before, using holistic treatments and targeting all-around health.” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, more on exactly what Lanini did to have Lizzo looking—and feeling—good as hell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The woman behind the woman. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Lanini, Lizzo first came to see her about a year ago, with the goal of both losing weight and improving her overall health. “We really wanted to take the natural approach because she hates needles and can’t handle pain,” she says. That meant regular &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64653766/benefits-of-sauna/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sauna sessions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sauna sessions&lt;/a&gt;, drinking Lanini’s detoxifying teas, several non-invasive muscle- and skin-tightening treatments, and a re-framing of her attitude toward food and nutrition. At the crux of their protocol? Lanini’s signature detox treatment. “This was really the best process for Lizzo because it helped boost her metabolism so much. We started doing it once or twice per week,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Brazilian-born Lanini is a lymphatic drainage expert, and lymphatic drainage is involved, the treatment is far more than that. “My technique is different because of my background and training. Being an esthetician in Brazil is nothing like being an esthetician here. I went to university for five years to earn my degree, and then spent 11 years working with doctors,” she explains. In fact, a similar protocol is even used on cancer patients in Brazil to help detox the body in between treatment rounds, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrasound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, an ultrasound treatment on the abdomen to help stimulate digestion. “Think of your gut as an apple tree. The ultrasound works to shake it and remove the ‘apples,’ the build-up on the gut lining,” she explains. This not only helps get things moving, so to speak, but also boosts metabolism and can even help combat brain fog. When your body doesn’t need to expend energy cleaning the gut, it can focus that energy elsewhere, Lanini claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step two involves a head-to-toe rubdown. Rather than relying on traditional lymphatic drainage techniques (more on those in a moment), Lanini’s method focuses on relaxing the fascia around the muscle to improve the muscle’s functionality and movement, in turn stimulating the lymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massage is paired with Lanini’s proprietary topical sculpting cream featuring guarana, a caffeine-rich Brazilian plant. Post-massage, the cream is mixed with different salts and clay and applied underneath a wrap to boost additional detoxification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sauna&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a 20-minute sauna session, Lanini's clients sip on a detoxifying, lymph-supporting tea, which also boasts Brazilian ingredients including acai, guarana, and hibiscus, among others. “It helps keep the body balanced, combats gut inflammation, and acts as electrolytes while you’re in the sauna,” Lanini explains, who adds that Lizzo drinks the tea twice daily. When all is said and done, clients feel lighter, less bloated, sleep better, and have improved energy, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this was Lizzo’s standard regimen, Lanini upped the ante before a big event, like the Met Gala (or our cover shoot). “When she wanted to be even more snatched we’d do the detox treatment three days in a row. You really do end up with a completely different body,” Lanini says. She adds that because Lizzo was also concerned with loose skin after losing so much weight, they also incorporated VelaShape, which tightens the skin using radiofrequency and other energy modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing it all home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for those of us who can’t see Lanini regularly? Even the much more widely-available, traditional lymphatic drainage massages can help improve both health and aesthetic appearance. “Think of the lymphatic system as your body’s waste management system,” says Andy Wood, a masseuse specializing in lymphatic drainage massage at Chicago’s &lt;a href="https://milkandhoneyspa.com/locations/gold-coast-chicago/chicago-gold-coast/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Milk + Honey Spa;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Milk + Honey Spa&lt;/a&gt;. It helps to move and flush out a variety of toxins and debris, including excess fluid, cellular waste, viruses and more, he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike blood, which is pumped by the heart, there’s nothing actually pumping the lymphatic system. It moves when we move, or as a result of gravity, compression, or manual stimulation, adds Morgana Kemper, owner of &lt;a href="https://labrasileiramassage.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:La Brasiliera;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;La Brasiliera&lt;/a&gt;, a spa specializing in Brazilian lymphatic drainage massage with locations in Charlotte and Chicago. Lymphatic drainage massage is a way of manually boosting the lymphatic system and is ideal for combatting swelling and strengthening immunity, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as aesthetics go, it’s important to point out that lymphatic drainage massage alone isn’t going to &lt;em&gt;actually &lt;/em&gt;cause any kind of real weight loss, Wood says. Rather, when paired with diet and exercise (as in Lizzo’s case), it can help enhance the effects and appearance of that weight loss, he explains. Still, because it does flush out excess fluid, it can help make the body, particularly the abdomen, appear slimmer and more contoured, Kemper says. And while lymphatic drainage is generally very gentle (think subtle tapping and soft, sweeping motions), Brazilian techniques in particular can be a bit firmer and help redistribute fat cells for an even greater contouring effect, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, both experts we spoke with say getting a lymphatic drainage massage monthly is ideal for those looking to make it a part of their wellness or weight loss routine. Can’t get to the spa? Kemper is a big fan of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a61973861/best-rebounding-workouts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:trampoline rebounding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;trampoline rebounding&lt;/a&gt;: “It can make the lymphatic system flow 15 times faster,” she says. Or, try &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a64523152/what-is-dry-brushing/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=20192787275&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACrQpnxzZaR2nlkmsMjHsOjBJ52ib&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwyvfDBhDYARIsAItzbZGDGU0-U7kQyt2tJrZl3vVCOOiHAap-L5OcoRrtx7phB7-LakxcH7AaAkniEALw_wcB" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dry brushing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dry brushing&lt;/a&gt;, another easy, at-home, lymph-boosting option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The picture-perfect proof.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Lizzo is the best advertisement for an integrative, holistic approach as the gateway to healthy, long-lasting changes. “Not only has she lost half of her body weight, she’s also so much more conscious of her health now. And that’s because we went from the inside-out,” says Lanini of her poster-child client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzo echoed these sentiments when she spoke with &lt;em&gt;WH. &lt;/em&gt;Yes, she’s surpassed her goal weight, but she’s also released the mental weight of feeling judged by others—and herself. “It’s not just about before-and-after photos. It’s about consistency, discipline, and self-love. I’m beyond honored to be a part of your transformation and your healing process. You’re not just inspiring others, you’re leading the way,” Lanini captioned the recent &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLq4AAvRTD_/?img_index=5" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram post;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; where she showcased Lizzo’s results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t agree more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:13:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5qa21pTUhsMWstbXdSRlljMTZkeGlRSFZhVVItamFLaVdPMkJnbU5rMFM1LVRVWXg2RUNHdWpBb2dRRW02NkNydUM0ZHIyY2ZlUDFISy1kN3h4ajNLZDU3cG9nUUZkS1Y2NmgyUHdmUTZZZHN0T1Q1Tg</guid></item><item><title>这种常见的血压药物延长了动物的寿命，减缓了衰老- ScienceAlert | This Common Blood Pressure Drug Extends Lifespan, Slows Aging in Animals - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPcWFDVWFWS3NJVjJVeFl4X0VzR0c4c1lyT1BUR1pRa2VpNzBqWTAyd3dDTmFsenlDdm1FbV9jSUR2S2g5RlgyRnJ4VXNEWUo1SlBWa2t6VkpqVU1LZGVfOVEzN1RJVFp4TENfVHlhc1pZU3k3UkFiZGlnMmphdnU4R1RIdTRXSW1fbVdTUmhpZy1OWnlmb3pOVWVHaEpNVzZNTWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The hypertension drug &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilmenidine"&gt;rilmenidine&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to slow down aging in worms, an effect that in humans could hypothetically help us live longer and keep us healthier in our latter years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has shown rilmenidine mimics the effects of caloric restriction on a cellular level. Reducing available energy while maintaining nutrition within the body has been shown to extend lifespans &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24146-z"&gt;in several animal models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether this translates to human biology, or is a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skipping-meals-could-be-much-worse-for-you-than-we-realized"&gt;potential risk to our health&lt;/a&gt;, is a topic of &lt;a href="https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2020/can-calorie-restriction-extend-your-lifespan/"&gt;ongoing debate&lt;/a&gt;. Finding ways to achieve the same benefits without the costs of extreme calorie cutting could lead to new ways to improve health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, young and old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worms treated with the drug – which is normally used to treat high blood pressure – lived longer and presented higher measures in a variety of health markers in the same way as restricting calories, as the scientists had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we have been able to show in animals that rilmenidine can increase lifespan," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said molecular biogerontologist João Pedro Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now keen to explore if rilmenidine may have other clinical applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/anti-aging-cocktail-extends-mouse-lifespan-by-about-30-percent?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Anti-Aging Cocktail Extends Mouse Lifespan by About 30 Percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; worm is a favorite for studies, because many of its genes have similarities to counterparts in our genome. Yet in spite of these similarities, it is still a rather distant relation to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg" alt="Various cell types illustrated in shades of pink" class="size-full wp-image-144581" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/08/SizeAndMorphologyCElegansCellsComparedToHumanCells642-600x334.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144581" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some human cell types and their nuclei on the left, compared to cells from &lt;em&gt;C. elegans &lt;/em&gt;on the right.

This particular chemical structure could be targeted in future attempts to improve lifespan and slow down aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that the lifespan-extending effects of rilmenidine were abolished when nish-1 was deleted," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Critically, rescuing the nish-1 receptor reinstated the increase in lifespan upon treatment with rilmenidine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets are hard to follow and come with a variety of side effects, such as hair thinning, dizziness, and brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's early days still, but the thinking is that this hypertension drug could confer the same benefits as a low-calorie diet while being easier on the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg" alt="A man sitting on a couch taking his blood pressure" class="size-full wp-image-141684" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ManTakingBloodPressurereadingAtHome_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141684" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Rilmenidine is normally used to treat high blood pressure.

We now know much more about what rilmenidine can do, and how it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With a global aging population, the benefits of delaying aging, even if slightly, are immense," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/01/23/hypertension-drug-could-be-repurposed-to-delay-ageing-study-finds/"&gt;said Magalhães&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13774"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i data-stringify-type="italic"&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in January 2023.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ROACH: I have low serum cholesterol but a high coronary calcium score, and I was told to take magnesium supplements to bring my calcium score down (in addition to daily aspirin and a statin). What are your thoughts about magnesium to bring down a high calcium score? -- D.B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EPM4DYX4GVEKZGZ6GCT3Z5R6JE"&gt;ANSWER: A coronary calcium score is a measurement of calcium in the blood vessels of the heart. High coronary calcium scores predict an increased likelihood of blockages in the blood vessels, which can lead to a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NZ7LHZUP4JCRRDYU2WQKUNU3WQ"&gt;The literature is mixed about whether a high magnesium intake can reduce the risk of coronary calcium and, in theory, reduce heart disease risk. Most of the evidence suggests that high blood magnesium levels reduce heart disease risk. However, people with higher magnesium levels are more likely to be consuming a healthier diet, which is known to reduce heart disease risk by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RGLA72QGQJFQVLUJXEHIEARPOA"&gt;To be sure that magnesium helps prevent heart disease, a future large trial could give half the subjects a magnesium supplement and the other half an identical-appearing pill without magnesium, then follow the groups to see which is more likely to get heart disease. These types of trials are difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and they have not yet been done for magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZJTCYIGRJNA43GNLY5JEQRZ7VM"&gt;However, you already have coronary calcium, so you are at a higher risk for a heart attack. Studies that have looked at the use of magnesium supplementation to prevent a heart attack in people with known or suspected blockages haven’t consistently found a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="DQK47HMYF5FPHDHZFILIYHRQAI"&gt;This is in contrast to statin trials, which have universally shown a reduction in heart attack rates in people with coronary blockages or those who are at a very high risk. Statins are effective at reducing risk for people with known blockages in their arteries, even if they have normal cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="B4ZVP2R3PZARDLDH24GLOPPHME"&gt;Having a low cholesterol level reduces but does not eliminate the risk for blockages. About 30% of people with coronary disease have normal cholesterol. This is why a holistic look at the coronary risk (including traditional and nontraditional risk factors apart from cholesterol) is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7SBW6SFJZFFRZLNPULCCPPGDQA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR.

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 &lt;strong&gt;Groundbreaking IVF technique&lt;/strong&gt; successfully delivers eight healthy babies in the UK, free from severe mitochondrial diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌟 The new method, called &lt;strong&gt;Mitochondrial Donation Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;, uses DNA from three sources to prevent the transmission of harmful mutations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👶 Significant reduction in &lt;strong&gt;mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed, with all children healthy at birth and minimal health issues reported.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💡 Despite its success, this procedure remains &lt;strong&gt;controversial&lt;/strong&gt; and unapproved in many countries, sparking ethical debates on genetic intervention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advancements in in vitro fertilization (IVF) technology have once again brought hope and joy to families worldwide. In a remarkable achievement, United Kingdom doctors have successfully delivered eight healthy babies using an innovative DNA-enhanced IVF method. This groundbreaking technique, aimed at preventing the transmission of severe mitochondrial diseases, has proven effective in giving these children a disease-free start in life. The news not only marks a significant milestone in reproductive medicine but also raises intriguing ethical and scientific discussions about the future of genetic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding Mitochondrial Diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria, often referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;powerhouses of the cell&lt;/strong&gt;, play a crucial role in energy production. Despite their small size, they contain a separate set of DNA, distinct from the nuclear DNA inherited from both parents. When mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, it can lead to serious health issues. These mutations can severely affect energy supply to vital organs such as the heart, muscles, and brain, often resulting in developmental delays and a shortened lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, around &lt;strong&gt;one in 5,000 newborns&lt;/strong&gt; are affected by these debilitating conditions, experiencing symptoms like vision loss and muscle weakening. The recent breakthrough in IVF technology, known as Mitochondrial Donation Treatment (MDT), offers a promising solution. By utilizing healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor, this technique aims to eliminate the risk of inheriting such diseases, providing a healthier future for those affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cM5cjTCL7P"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/its-like-teleporting-knowledge-this-breakthrough-optical-ai-chip-transfers-100-million-books-in-just-7-minutes-using-light-speed-data/"&gt;“It’s Like Teleporting Knowledge”: This Breakthrough Optical AI Chip Transfers 100 Million Books in Just 7 Minutes Using Light-Speed Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Innovative Three-source Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new IVF technique, known as &lt;strong&gt;Pronuclear Transfer&lt;/strong&gt;, involves a revolutionary approach to conception. By combining DNA from three sources—the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm, and healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor—this method ensures that the child inherits the vast majority of their traits from their biological parents. However, they also receive a small fraction (approximately 0.1%) of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the donor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This genetic alteration, while minute, is significant enough to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial diseases. The process involves transferring the nuclear DNA from an egg with a mitochondrial DNA mutation into a donor egg with its nucleus removed. The resulting embryo, which contains the parents’ nuclear DNA and the donor’s healthy mitochondrial DNA, is then implanted, leading to a successful pregnancy. This approach not only offers hope for affected families but also opens new doors in the field of genetic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zIWn6ShkUq"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/nvidia-helix-destroys-ai-lag-forever-ultra-powerful-system-instantly-transforms-stalled-chatbots-into-million-word-lightning-fast-assistants-for-us-businesses/"&gt;“NVIDIA Helix Destroys AI Lag Forever”: Ultra-Powerful System Instantly Transforms Stalled Chatbots Into Million-Word, Lightning-Fast Assistants for US Businesses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Promising Results and Ongoing Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the study have been overwhelmingly positive, with a &lt;strong&gt;95-100% reduction in mutated mitochondrial DNA&lt;/strong&gt; observed in six of the babies. The remaining two showed a substantial reduction of 77-88%, well below the threshold for disease manifestation. All eight children were healthy at birth, with only minor, treatable health issues reported in a few cases. This success demonstrates the potential of the technique to transform lives, offering a disease-free future to children who might otherwise face severe health challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its success, the procedure remains controversial and is not yet approved in many countries, including the US and France. Ethical objections include concerns about the destruction of human embryos and fears of the emergence of “designer babies.” These debates underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications of genetic intervention, even as science continues to push boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hpe0Pfyv7f"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/07/it-transforms-while-flying-engineers-create-shape-shifting-robot-that-morphs-mid-air-to-land-and-roll-on-wheels/"&gt;“It Transforms While Flying”: Engineers Create Shape-Shifting Robot That Morphs Mid-Air to Land and Roll on Wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ethical Considerations and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any groundbreaking scientific advancement, the development of MDT has sparked ethical debates. Critics argue that altering the genetic makeup of embryos raises concerns about the potential for unintended consequences and the moral implications of such interventions. Supporters, however, emphasize the profound impact this technology can have on families affected by mitochondrial diseases, offering them a chance at a healthier future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The details of this procedure have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, providing a comprehensive overview of the scientific and ethical considerations involved. As the technique continues to evolve, it will be crucial for the scientific community, policymakers, and the public to engage in open dialogues about the responsible use of genetic technologies. How will society balance the potential benefits of these advances with the ethical considerations they entail?&lt;/p&gt;

after 19 cases, including two active cases, were recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Case counts have also been increasing in Samoa, Tonga, French Polynesia, Fiji and Kiribati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July, Italy reported the first locally acquired case of dengue for the year, specifically in the Emilia Romagna region, while 82 imported cases of the virus were recorded in several regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Italy, health authorities have reported the first locally acquired cases of both dengue and chikungunya, specifically in the Emilia-Romagna region (Pictured: Rimini, Italy)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Both of the mosquito-borne viruses are typically found in tropical regions like South America and India &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Italian health officials also reported the first locally acquired case of Chikungunya for the year, again found in the Emilia-Romagna region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An additional 50 imported cases of the virus were recorded across a number of regions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, holidaymakers jetting off to France were warned they were at risk of contracting chikungunya after&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14875285/warning-virus-Chikungunya-Europe-summer-hotspot-mosquitoes-France.html"&gt; eight local cases were recorded&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chikungunya outbreak has occurred far earlier in the year than is typical, and this could indicate the mosquitoes that carry chikungunya are becoming increasingly at home in France thanks to climate change, the warning said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though not fatal, chikungunya can cause a range of effects, which are primarily marked by a sudden onset of fever and severe joint pain, while other common symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the acute phase of the illness usually resolves within a week or two, the joint pain can persist for weeks, months, or even years in some individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, dengue fever can cause a range of effects, including mild flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in some cases, infections can progress to severe dengue, which can cause potentially life-threatening complications such as internal bleeding and organ damage, and death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “I recommend that clients add muesli to their cereal lineup,” says&lt;a href="http://thedietitiandish.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Patricia Kolesa, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Any kind of unsweetened muesli can support healthy blood pressure, but Alpen’s No Sugar Added variety is a particularly smart choice. It includes a mix of oats, wheat flakes, dried fruit and nuts, providing an excellent source of fiber—one of the most important nutrients for blood pressure. “Fiber has been shown to be supportive in overall heart health by lowering blood pressure,” Kolesa says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The negligible sodium (20 milligrams, or less than 1% of the Daily Value) is another point in this cereal’s favor.

Just be sure to check labels for sodium, as some brands of bran flakes are surprisingly high.

If you prefer a cozy, warm breakfast, try Bob’s Red Mill’s 7-Grain Hot Cereal. It’s packed with a variety of grains, including wheat, rye, oats, triticale, barley, brown rice and oat bran. &lt;a href="https://kcampbellnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Kiran Campbell, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, says she’s a fan for its 6 grams fiber, 0 grams added sugars and 0 milligrams sodium per serving—all of which are great for healthy blood pressure. Cook this seven-grain cereal on the stovetop, in the microwave or in the slow cooker for a warming morning porridge.

Shredded wheat cereal has been around since 1893—and this oldie continues to be a goodie for blood pressure. “This is one of the top widely available cereals for helping reduce blood pressure,” says&lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2?fbclid=IwY2xjawLjXShleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETF6VzBOdGt5SlNDRFk4YzI0AR5gwJ1uRtcO_j5ksqxivldKhlXyGzpmPu8K4FkAWHrn9OpGDmGLarE7mVeWKQ_aem_oCa7lTprbth6XHWbehis_g" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Avery Zenker, RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to Campbell, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/58391/the-1-food-you-should-eat-for-breakfast/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;oats are one of the top ingredients&lt;/a&gt; to look for in a cereal that supports healthy blood pressure. “Oats and barley contain a soluble fiber, beta-glucan, which may help lower blood pressure, especially in those with a higher BMI (body mass index),” she says. In fact, a 2023 study found that oat consumption significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, particularly among people with hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair with fruit. &lt;/strong&gt;Whether fresh, frozen or dried, fruits like berries, bananas and apples add fiber and potassium—two important nutrients for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-for-high-blood-pressure-8769222" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use reduced or low-fat milk. &lt;/strong&gt;Research is still teasing apart the complex relationship between dairy and heart health, but the American Heart Association continues to recommend low-fat milk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay attention to calcium. &lt;/strong&gt;Don’t miss out on calcium for your blood pressure. Cow’s milk and fortified plant milks are good sources of this heart-healthy mineral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check sodium levels. &lt;/strong&gt;Some cereal brands sneak in more sodium than you might realize—so be sure to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-i-check-first-on-the-nutrition-label-8548484" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;read the nutrition label carefully&lt;/a&gt;.

Do you find yourself withdrawing, or do you turn to anyone for support?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-right&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/806b2c0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/320x448!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/190cf46/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/568x795!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17629c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/768x1075!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d539f7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/1024x1434!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34762eb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/1200x1680!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="Clinical psychologist Robert Chernoff." srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67291e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/320x448!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8f557b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/568x795!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/267edb1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/768x1075!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dbe6b92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/1024x1434!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b042a4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/1200x1680!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b042a4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1500x2100+0+0/resize/1200x1680!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F78%2F16%2Fec36810e454fb9b07c6535c5c3e5%2Fla-sci-doctors-at-cedars-sinai01.JPEG" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;Clinical psychologist Robert Chernoff. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Cedars-Sinai)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Xaia has been used by about 300 patients across various research studies at Cedars-Sinai, including those focused on chronic pain, alcohol use disorder, and irritable bowel syndrome, said Spiegel, director of health services research at Cedars-Sinai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cms-textAlign-left"&gt;Many people with chronic illnesses also struggle with anxiety or depression, Spiegel said. Physical and emotional symptoms feed off each other, and tools like Xaia aim to help with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool isn’t covered by insurance yet, but billing codes for virtual reality therapy and digital health services do exist, and other hospitals like the Mayo Clinic are beginning to use them. VRx has an agreement to deploy Xaia at Mayo Clinic, according to VRx Chief Executive Gabe Zetter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xaia isn’t the only app of its kind. Woebot, a pioneering chatbot developed by psychologist Alison Darcy while at Stanford, used scripted conversations based on cognitive behavioral therapy to support users with anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it reached 1.5 million users, the company shut down the app in July. Darcy said the company is now focused on building new tools with large language models, since AI is moving faster than regulators like the Food and Drug Administration can keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, some emotional support chatbots have been blamed for deepening distress, including one incident in which a Florida teen died by suicide in 2024 after extended conversations with a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such incidents underscore the risks of emotionally responsive AI tools, said Todd Essig, a psychologist and founder and co-chair of the American Psychoanalytic Assn.’s Council on Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even after the most loving, empathic response, an AI doesn’t care if you drive to the store or drive off a cliff,” Essig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI programs learn to mimic human responses, Essig said, so it’s up to the people building them to set clear limits and ensure they don’t cause harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;

  &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;“Mentally and physically, I feel more at peace,” Misty Williams said after a session with AI-powered Xaia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When built with ethical frameworks and used under clinical supervision, tools like Xaia can support genuine therapeutic progress, functioning more like digital journals — a modern twist on the paper workbooks given to patients decades ago, said Jodi Halpern, a professor of bioethics and medical humanities at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many emotional support chatbots that aren’t clinically monitored are designed to mimic intimacy and build emotional bonds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People can experience the app as another,” Halpern said. “But it’s not actually giving them real-life experiences with other humans that are important for developing the healthy, mutually empathic curiosity that people need to participate in complex human relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halpern noted there is a difference between clinically approved mental health tools and those with no oversight. She and others are supporting a California bill sponsored by state Sen. Steve Padilla (D-Chula Vista)  that would require companies developing mental health chatbots or apps to disclose whether their tools are clinically validated, regulated by the FDA or rely on generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liran said he and his partners are aware of the limitations and have built in guardrails to keep the chatbot from saying anything harmful or inappropriate. For example, one arm of the AI generates the response, and another instantly double-checks it to make sure it’s safe before letting it through to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not just opening it up to the public,” Liran said, pointing out that the guided therapy version on mobile and desktop is available only through a licensed clinician right now and Cedars is testing Xaia in multiple studies. “We’re trying to be very careful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 14-person study, patients using Xaia with mild or moderate anxiety or depression opened up about a variety of topics, including a mother who passed away and fear of being laid off. For a patient who had been having night sweats since a breakup, Xaia asked to hear more about what made the relationship feel unresolved and how it affected the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the patients still preferred the nuance and responsiveness of a human therapist, but the medical literature suggests patients are warming up to the idea of a nonhuman therapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in PLOS Mental Health in February, participants were asked to compare responses written by licensed therapists and those generated by ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only did many struggle to tell the difference, they consistently rated the AI’s replies as more empathic, culturally sensitive and emotionally engaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xaia’s creators see the tool as an extension of the patient-therapist relationship. It’s the kind of thing that might be useful if someone needs mental health support in the middle of the night or between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still need therapists — humans — to look other humans in the eye to have conversations about vulnerable topics,” Spiegel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, “it’s not practical to simply bury our head in the sand and say we shouldn’t do this, because AI is everywhere,” he said. “We’ll be brushing our teeth with AI before long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQNEtKTEF6ekRYX3hHUFpaOHdXdERDdE9UQVZwRGhQUUpFbzYxT1VKeHRMMkhUMXE1cHhpSWU3WUttY002dnhneHhEOEtoNVBDZHZyZzIwNldYX3Y1ZVVnUUNBREpaUlZpV2Y3eE92OUJQSHp6QzVsNmZxVUZNaVludmVtQnU5cTBSUnJOallIQnJYOENFcFgxSVFuUExFY09CdTRDamw2MHE1VTF4UW5EcHdvODRzWWdUclM4MzFB</guid></item><item><title>自然提升GLP-1的终极肠道健康杂货清单- MindBodyGreen | The Ultimate Gut-Health Grocery List To Boost GLP-1 Naturally - MindBodyGreen</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSlZZZ0dmLUFjZ0hXQjROalFTbTFZUjdDR3dFSF9CNGctd195cm1sOC1iSzFqQzd3NF83RnZuem8xb3RieHo5REY5MkVadGxMd21faUJ4RjJiazdMdlhlVkh3eUl5MDMzLWFCRnVLN3FVeVFZZlFHbnVaZXFhT1pQN09yZElyd1JLeWFSNVZsODZwUFVCT19DdW5zOFI5Mlk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span id="content"&gt;&lt;div end="false" class="sc-11rlt5o-4 gjIquG"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While weight loss shots dominate headlines, what if your kitchen already contains the ingredients needed to activate your body's own GLP-1 production? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MindBodyGreen</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:21:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSlZZZ0dmLUFjZ0hXQjROalFTbTFZUjdDR3dFSF9CNGctd195cm1sOC1iSzFqQzd3NF83RnZuem8xb3RieHo5REY5MkVadGxMd21faUJ4RjJiazdMdlhlVkh3eUl5MDMzLWFCRnVLN3FVeVFZZlFHbnVaZXFhT1pQN09yZElyd1JLeWFSNVZsODZwUFVCT19DdW5zOFI5Mlk</guid></item><item><title>拿骚县发行的狂犬病迫在眉睫的公共卫生威胁-新闻12 | Imminent public health threat for rabies issued in Nassau County - News 12</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRVR6NFMwUHEtNmVyTHVoNHdtQUUzQnFWN0padmlyUElxa2RHT0NqQzRuRXVuYmJLelJjR2hObnItNE4zX185WHdoZDFQWjN3WEtnOXFjVFpZSEc3RG5ySDFaczRlQXV0SnY1dnY5WElweS1vTXRhalBhU2ZHcDZwc09jd0pjWDM2TmRFbF9HOUgzVnhsZEgyaUR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-e6358465-0 dxMubp"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;Nassau County health officials are sounding the alarm and issuing an imminent public health threat due to the spread of rabies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The Nassau County Health Department reports that there have been 25 positive rabies tests since last July. This marks the worst the situation has been in nearly a decade, since the county announced it had eradicated terrestrial rabies in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Most of the cases in Nassau are among raccoons and feral cats, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="block"&gt;&lt;a href="https://longisland.news12.com/health-officials-sixth-rabid-raccoon-found-in-amityville-area-this-year"&gt;In May, the Suffolk County Health Department &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;said it had identified six positive rabies cases in raccoons and all in Amityville. News 12 reached out early this morning for an update on rabies statistics in Suffolk County but has not yet heard back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="adobe-dc-view-20"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials say avoid feeding or touching wild animals or stray cats and dogs, make sure your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccinations and keep pets indoors at night. Anyone who is bitten or scratched by an animal should seek immediate medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Rabies is a serious viral disease that affects the nervous system in mammals, including humans. While preventable by quickly vaccinating after an exposure, it is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Last Friday, the state Health Department issued a warning and urged New Yorkers to take steps to prevent rabies infections during the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Rabid animals have been found in all counties in New York, officials said. Last year, the state's Wadsworth Center Rabies Laboratory confirmed rabies in 313 wild and domestic animals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Nassau Health Commissioner Dr. Irina Gelman will hold a media availability to discuss the rabies declaration issued by the Health Department today at the Theodore Roosevelt Executive and Legislative Building in Mineola at 11 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:10:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPRVR6NFMwUHEtNmVyTHVoNHdtQUUzQnFWN0padmlyUElxa2RHT0NqQzRuRXVuYmJLelJjR2hObnItNE4zX185WHdoZDFQWjN3WEtnOXFjVFpZSEc3RG5ySDFaczRlQXV0SnY1dnY5WElweS1vTXRhalBhU2ZHcDZwc09jd0pjWDM2TmRFbF9HOUgzVnhsZEgyaUR3</guid></item><item><title>随着年龄的增长，我如何锻炼肌肉？ -《纽约时报》 | How Can I Build Muscle as I Age? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPdWJ0QTQ2OTYxdnB5UGdILTl3RmhNYk42UlpXYUxGUTFnSEZjNDRNdjIwaFpMWVg1VW1RZTdpTTFVTk8teE9DYzdHTWo1emlMOGlGT1JJQzFlQjN3RmxraGRyUnBaZXo3a2VseFJYWTV4Z1FpbUlsSEVzV3J6U2d5aA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 09:00:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPdWJ0QTQ2OTYxdnB5UGdILTl3RmhNYk42UlpXYUxGUTFnSEZjNDRNdjIwaFpMWVg1VW1RZTdpTTFVTk8teE9DYzdHTWo1emlMOGlGT1JJQzFlQjN3RmxraGRyUnBaZXo3a2VseFJYWTV4Z1FpbUlsSEVzV3J6U2d5aA</guid></item><item><title>许多肺癌现在都在非吸烟者中。科学家们想知道为什么。-《纽约时报》 | Many Lung Cancers Are Now in Nonsmokers.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dopamine is one of the most extensively studied chemical messengers in the human brain, and yet scientists are still figuring out how it works to accomplish so much.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For years, the classic view has been that, when released, dopamine slowly diffuses through the brain like a chemical megaphone, broadcasting information far and wide to numerous target cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Recently, however, that perspective has changed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conb.2019.01.001"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Newer research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; suggests that dopamine is also capable of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41972-6"&gt;short&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-024-01803-8"&gt;sharp&lt;/a&gt; whispers, precisely directed within milliseconds to neighboring cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If researchers are right, this localized signal could be a "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;fundamental building block&lt;/a&gt;" that's overlooked in the brain's dopamine system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-seems-to-have-a-blocking-effect-on-dopamine-and-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Caffeine Seems to Have a Blocking Effect on Dopamine, And Here's Why&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine in the brain is different to dopamine in the rest of the body. In the blood, dopamine helps modulate the function of multiple organs as well as our immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the brain, it's a chemical messenger involved in mediating a diversity of animal behaviors &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; from movement and mood to sleep and memory to reward and motivation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Neurons that release dopamine are known to do so with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adx6367"&gt;&lt;span&gt;different firing patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and yet it's not clear what messages these specific signals encode, or why.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The ability to send both fast &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; slow signals could explain how the brain's dopamine system can achieve so much with such specificity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png" alt="Dopamin Pathway" class="size-medium wp-image-168136" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-642x442.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-603x415.png 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-768x529.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-1536x1058.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_-600x413.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/Dopaminergic_pathways.svg_.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168136" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The main dopamine pathway in the brain.

B&lt;/span&gt;roader dopamine release, meanwhile, is widespread and elicits a slower response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our current research found that dopamine signaling and transmission in the brain is much more complex than we thought," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; pharmacologist Christopher Ford from the University of Colorado. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We knew that dopamine plays a role in many different behaviors, and our work gives the beginning of a framework for understanding how all those different behaviors could all be regulated by dopamine."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The specific neurons studied by Ford and colleagues come from the brain's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striatum"&gt;&lt;span&gt;striatum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; – a part of the basal ganglia involved in motor and reward systems that is rich in dopamine-releasing neurons. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The striatum receives dopamine inputs from various parts of the brain, and it is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tins.2018.12.004"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2015.06.033"&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-024-03165-7"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Parkinson's disease, for instance, is marked by a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;degeneration of dopamine neurons&lt;/a&gt; connecting to the striatum.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how dopamine sends signals in this part of the brain could be crucial for coming up with new treatments for a variety of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We are really only at the tip of the iceberg in trying to understand how dysfunctions in dopamine contribute to diseases like Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia or addiction," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/new-discovery-reveals-dopamine-operates-with-surgical-precision-not-as-a-broad-signal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ford. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"More work is needed to grasp how these specific changes in dopamine signaling are affected in these different neurological and psychiatric diseases."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adp9833"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He even went to see massage therapists and other physical therapists, but nothing helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was until he discovered a move called the reverse Jefferson curl, which he describes as a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-reverse-jefferson-curl"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reverse Jefferson curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move stretches and strengthens the muscles in the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found this movement late into my own rehab process after two years of persistent low back pain,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn’t a magic fix, but once I introduced it consistently—two to three times per week—I started noticing real improvements over a couple of months. It became a key part of the bigger picture that helped me recover.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move is particularly great for pain related to “tissue obstruction [after injury], segmental stiffness, or lack of posterior chain control”, according to Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5Li3Gi5AhL49zAVX2f5NGQ" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5Li3Gi5AhL49zAVX2f5NGQ slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-form-tips"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Form tips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kooner demonstrates the move in his Instagram reel above, but it’s important to do it with correct form to avoid injury, so we asked him for some extra tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For beginners, I recommend starting against a wall with your hands supporting your hips from behind,” he advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Focus on segmental spinal control first—no weight, slow tempo, and small range,” Kooner adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once comfortable, you can add resistance gradually,” he says. “I used only 3lbs in a backpack, and I wouldn’t suggest going above 10–15lbs, even at more advanced stages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete up to 10 repetitions, four to six times per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-why-the-reverse-jefferson-curl-is-so-great-for-combating-back-pain"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Why the reverse Jefferson curl is so great for combating back pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The spine is designed to move and bear load in all directions,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving your back muscles in different directions is key to improving mobility, flexibility and dealing with stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This exercise helps improve spinal flexion strength and control, which are often neglected in rehab and training programs,” says Kooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t try this exercise if your pain is severe or you have a specific injury. Consult a doctor before trying it and don't continue with the exercise if it hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, three years later, he is not only healthy and thriving, but his brain cancer has completely ‘vanished’!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, 40-year-old Ben Trotman was diagnosed with terminal glioblastoma, the most common and deadliest form of brain cancer that typically carries a grim prognosis with a median survival of just 12–18 months. Yet, over two years after receiving a single dose of ipilimumab before standard care, Trotman reportedly remains cancer-free and healthy as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the care of consultant oncologist Dr. Paul Mulholland at UCLH (University College London Hospital), Trotman became part of an NHS-funded trial that administers ipilimumab, a checkpoint inhibitor designed to boost the immune system, before traditional surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, his scans show no signs of recurrence, an unprecedented outcome in glioblastoma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The medical marvel&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new clinical trial for the most deadly type of brain cancer, glioblastoma, which helped Ben with another shot at life, is looking for patients to join after an incredible success story. Organized by the NHS, this study aims to enroll 16 people over 18 months and is dedicated to Baroness Margaret McDonagh, who lost her battle with the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients diagnosed with glioblastoma will receive an immunotherapy drug called ipilimumab before starting standard treatments, making the most of their immune systems when they are at their strongest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is being led by experts at University College London Hospital’s National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. It follows a previous study with the same drug, which had to close because not enough patients joined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial honors the late Baroness Margaret McDonagh’s memory and, like Trotman, participants receive ipilimumab to prime their immune defenses, with hopes of replicating his reassuring response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ipilimumab: The key behind the breakthrough&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, an immune checkpoint. In cancers like melanoma, it enhances T-cell activity, enabling the body to attack tumors. When used before standard glioblastoma therapy, it primes the immune system to better target cancer cells. In Trotman’s case, it appears to have either eradicated or dramatically controlled his tumor, an outcome never before reported in this context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “window-of-opportunity” pre-treatment approach is groundbreaking. By delivering immunotherapy before surgery, it maximizes immune activation and potentially aids post-operative cancer control, a novel strategy in glioblastoma care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is glioblastoma?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma, previously known as glioblastoma multiforme or GBM, is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain cancer in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma originates from astrocytes, a type of glial cell that supports nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Glioblastoma is classified as a Grade IV tumor, meaning it's highly aggressive, grows rapidly, and infiltrates surrounding brain tissue. The exact cause of most glioblastomas is unknown. However, it is understood that the disease develops when brain cells undergo DNA mutations that cause them to grow and multiply uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prognosis for glioblastoma is generally poor, with a median survival of about 12-18 months after diagnosis. The five-year survival rate is around 5%, meaning about 5% of patients are still alive five years after their diagnosis. Glioblastoma almost always recurs despite maximal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, Trotman’s cancer-free scans more than two years post-treatment represent a hopeful breakthrough. It suggests that bolstering immune readiness before conventional treatment might overcome glioblastoma’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The success story&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success story comes from Ben Trotman, who was diagnosed in October 2022 at the age of 40. Now, at 43, two years and eight months after his treatment, his scans are clear, and there are no traces of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Mulholland, the consultant medical oncologist who is leading this new trial and treated Ben, as reported by The Independent, shared, “It is very unusual to have a clear scan with glioblastoma, especially when he didn’t have the follow-up surgery that had been planned to remove all of the tumor that was initially visible on scans. We hope that the immunotherapy and follow-up treatment Ben has had will hold his tumor at bay – and it has so far, which we are delighted to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben's life has changed significantly since his diagnosis; he got married to Emily just two months after receiving the immunotherapy treatment, and in April, they welcomed their daughter, Mabel. Emily expressed the emotional toll of Ben's diagnosis, saying, “Getting this diagnosis was the most traumatic experience. We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. Had we not met Dr. Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the immunotherapy, Ben went on to have the standard treatments of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He continues to have quarterly scans, which remain clear. Ben reflected on their journey, stating, “We obviously don’t know what the future holds, but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and me a bit of hope. We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dame Siobhain McDonagh MP led a successful fundraising campaign that gathered over £1 million to support this new trial. Her sister, Baroness McDonagh, sadly passed away from glioblastoma in 2023. Dame Siobhain shared, “My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma. Changing this was Margaret’s final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory. I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret, who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret’s Trial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mulholland is also thankful for Margaret and Siobhain’s dedication, stating, “When I met Margaret, she said to me, ‘What can I do to support you to cure this disease?’. I am incredibly grateful to her and to Siobhain, whose campaigning and fundraising in her sister’s memory have led to this new clinical trial opening for patients with this most aggressive form of brain cancer that has such a poor prognosis, with most patients surviving just nine months after diagnosis. The crucial element of this trial is that patients will have their immune system boosted by the drug before they have any other treatment, when they are fit and well enough to tolerate the immunotherapy. We’re taking everything we have learned from previous trials into this new study, and we are already planning follow-on trials. My aim is to find a cure for glioblastoma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s ahead?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Mulholland, the trial is expanding enrollment, aiming to confirm both safety and effectiveness. Currently, the National Brain Appeal is funding two positions to support Dr. Mulholland’s vital research. The treatment will take place at the NIHR UCLH’s Clinical Research Facility and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery.

			&lt;p&gt;Most of us want to enjoy later life feeling strong, connected, and mentally sharp. But how often do we stop to think about whether the things we're doing right now are helping us get there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new quiz – which we have developed as part of the &lt;a href="https://wels.open.ac.uk/research/projects/take-5"&gt;Take Five to Age Well&lt;/a&gt; project, a free, expert-led, month-long challenge from The Open University and Age UK – makes it easier, and more empowering, to ask that question, reflect and take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy ageing doesn't depend on just one thing. Research shows that our long-term wellbeing is shaped by a mix of physical, mental and social factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-explains-how-you-can-assess-whether-youre-aging-well?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Expert Explains How You Can Assess Whether You're Aging Well&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why experts, including us, have identified five key areas – known as the &lt;a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/health-sports-psychology/mental-health/five-pillars-ageing-well"&gt;Five Pillars for Ageing Well&lt;/a&gt; – that form a strong foundation for staying well and thriving in later life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Are you eating well?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you getting enough &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/eating-a-balanced-diet/"&gt;fruit and vegetables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/385/bmj-2023-078476"&gt;limiting ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; and meeting your body's changing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6489487/"&gt;nutritional needs&lt;/a&gt;? Diets like the &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02772-3"&gt;Mediterranean plan&lt;/a&gt; are linked with a &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-02772-3"&gt;lower risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and other chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malnutrition is &lt;a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/health-wellbeing/conditions-illnesses/malnutrition/"&gt;a serious concern&lt;/a&gt; in older age, especially when it comes to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5389428/"&gt;maintaining strong muscles&lt;/a&gt; and bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Are you staying hydrated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/10925/dietary-reference-intakes-for-water-potassium-sodium-chloride-and-sulfate"&gt;drinking enough water&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/six-ways-to-look-after-your-brain-health-in-your-20s-and-30s-231119"&gt;support both your brain and body&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dont-like-drinking-plain-water-10-healthy-ideas-for-staying-hydrated-this-summer-191859"&gt;Dehydration can creep up&lt;/a&gt; easily and affect cognitive function, mood and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/data-statistics/sugar-sweetened-beverages-intake.html#:%7E:text=Frequently%20drinking%20sugar%2Dsweetened%20beverages,gout%2C%20a%20type%20of%20arthritis."&gt;Cutting down on sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt; can help you to maintain a healthy weight and staying within &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/alcohol-advice/the-risks-of-drinking-too-much/"&gt;recommended alcohol limits&lt;/a&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(20)30367-6/fulltext"&gt;help lower your risk&lt;/a&gt; of conditions like dementia. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/older-people-need-to-stay-hydrated-heres-how-128420"&gt;Hydration really matters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with life-limiting illnesses or conditions such as advanced dementia, where appetite and oral intake may be severely reduced, sugary drinks may be one of the few sources of calories they can tolerate. In these cases, hydration and comfort take priority over strict nutritional guidelines, and personalised care plans should always guide decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Are you being physically active?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you moving regularly? Enough to raise your heart rate? Are you breaking up long periods of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/why-sitting-too-much-is-bad-for-us/#:%7E:text=Studies%20have%20linked%20being%20inactive,and%20break%20down%20body%20fat."&gt;sitting with movement&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sedentary lifestyle is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7700832/"&gt;linked to a wide range&lt;/a&gt; of health risks. Simple habits &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/walking-for-health/"&gt;like walking&lt;/a&gt; more can boost physical fitness, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6481600/"&gt;sharpen the mind&lt;/a&gt; and help &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/osteoporosis/prevention/"&gt;prevent osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, especially when &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39322861/"&gt;paired with good nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Are you connecting socially?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you keeping in touch with others, spending time in your community and enjoying meaningful connection? Loneliness &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/mental-and-emotional-health/depression-and-older-adults"&gt;increases the risk&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="168693" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9995915/"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building strong social ties earlier in life &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667032121000275"&gt;can help protect wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-loneliness-really-as-damaging-to-your-health-as-smoking-15-cigarettes-a-day-204959"&gt;the long term&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Are you challenging your brain?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you keeping your mind active by learning, reading, &lt;a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/playing-instrument-linked-better-brain-health-older-adults"&gt;playing an instrument&lt;/a&gt;, or trying something new? &lt;a href="https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/joga/2/1/article-p98.xml"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that learning about your interests, activities like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885259/"&gt;crossword puzzles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/2159676X.2017.1348387"&gt;new physical activities&lt;/a&gt; can keep the brain healthy and potentially delay dementia. There's no magic fix, but &lt;a href="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/health-sports-psychology/mental-health/five-pillars-ageing-well"&gt;even small actions&lt;/a&gt; can have lasting benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We developed the Take Five to Age Well quiz to help people reflect on how they're doing across these five areas – and where there might be room to grow. The follow-up resources are based on real-life experiences of ageing from diverse communities and offer small, achievable steps you can start today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many online quizzes, this one doesn't just score you – it supports you. After signing up to the month-long challenge and taking the quiz, the Take Five to Age Well participants receive tips, encouragement and expert-led advice supporting participants' current habits and needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've also partnered with BridgitCare – organisation that works with Councils, the NHS and Carer Charities across the UK, to help identify carers and scale the support provided with the use of technology – to create &lt;a href="https://agewell.bridgit.care/"&gt;Age Well&lt;/a&gt;, a free, web-based tool offering personalised daily actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to add more greens to your plate, look for expert tips, and easy ways to stay in control of your health, hobbies, and wellbeing or swap ten minutes of scrolling for a short walk, every step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age Well can also connect you to local groups and services to help turn good intentions into lasting routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/pL9ypOX3BBA?feature=shared"&gt;Healthy ageing&lt;/a&gt; isn't just about avoiding illness – it's about learning how to age well, maintaining independence, confidence and quality of life. And with an ageing population, learning that supports all taking proactive steps to protect our mental and physical health is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part? Many of the most effective actions are small and realistic. You don't have to run marathons or give up everything you enjoy. Take Five to Age Well meets you where you are – and helps you build a future where you feel stronger, more connected and better supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter your age, it's never too early – or too late – to start your journey to ageing well.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256381/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of COVID-19 cases in Hawaii is rising again, prompting a message of vigilance from health officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health today reported the statewide test positivity rate — or percentage of all tests that are positive — at 12.4% as of Saturday, up from 10.9% the previous week. DOH said the virus is circulating at higher levels than expected, based on historic trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH noted the 7-day average of new cases also rose on all islands over the last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend is in line with a rising number of COVID cases across more than half of the U.S., including in more than 25 states — with some experts dubbing it a summer wave. Hawaii is one of 10 states where COVID cases are definitely growing, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with Texas, Iowa, and Virginia, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest CDC models show two new variants growing dominant in the U.S., including NB.1.8.1, nicknamed Nimbus, widely reported to cause “razor blade throat” symptoms, and XFG, nicknamed Stratus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization is monitoring both, which experts said have not been shown to be more deadly than previous ones. Both are considered descendants of omicron.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The increase reminds us that COVID-19 remains a health concern in the community,” state health officials in a news release. “At the moment, COVID-19 is outpacing flu and RSV in test positivity, emergency room visits and hospital admissions. The public is reminded to take reasonable precautions to avoid getting sick. Consult your doctor about vaccinations for yourself and your family.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said the 2024-2025 COVID vaccine is recommended for higher-risk populations including children ages 6 months to 2 years old; those ages 2 to 64 who are immuno-compromised; adults ages 65 and older; pregnant women; and health care workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials also recommend staying home when sick, covering one’s cough, and wearing a well-fitted mask while infected or recovering from COVID or when indoors with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Brown, an infectious diseases expert who continues tracking COVID trends, noted cases on Oahu rose from 25 a day last week to 40 a day this week. Emergency department visits for COVID in Hawaii have also been on the rise, and wastewater concentration levels for COVID have been “very high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH is updating its &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/coronavirusdisease2019/current-situation-in-hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;COVID-19 dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in a gap in data viewable to the public over the past few weeks. The weekly average of COVID patients hospitalized, at 20, has not been updated since June 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH says additional features to its COVID dashboard are coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar. But new research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body's most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain's security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients. The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Study Reveals How This Artificial Sweetener May Cause Heart Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body's natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells' ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol's effect on the blood vessels' ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients. This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body's natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a "clot buster" called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke. But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced "blood vessel on a chip" systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar's sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It's now found in thousands of products, especially in many "sugar-free" and "keto-friendly" foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A man reaching for a protein bar in a shop." src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=338&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/681057/original/file-20250720-56-8ow1ds.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=425&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such a protein bars.

But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even "natural" sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="168676" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain's protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261500/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A single drop in daily insulin can mean trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That story has shaped treatment for nearly a century, and in many places, it works. Yet most of the data behind that story comes from Europe and North America. What if a different chapter has been unfolding elsewhere all along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In clinics across &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sub-Saharan Africa&lt;/a&gt;, nurses have long whispered to visiting researchers that some young patients labeled “type 1” seemed to hold on without insulin for weeks, even months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hunch was hard to test – supplies are scarce, and lab work can be expensive – but the anecdotes kept piling up. Those whispers have now turned into evidence, and the findings are shaking up what we thought we knew &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/"&gt;about diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surprising-african-clinic-data"&gt;Surprising African clinic data&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 900 children, teens, and young adults in Cameroon, Uganda, and South Africa joined a project called the Young-Onset Diabetes in Sub-Saharan Africa (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05013346?tab=table" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;YODA&lt;/a&gt;) study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples, genetic scans, and clinical histories poured in. The results, published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/em&gt;, were striking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 65 percent of participants lacked the autoimmune fingerprints that define classic type 1 diabetes, and the usual high-risk immune genes were missing as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 8.5 percent carried more than one diabetes-related autoantibody, a stark contrast to the roughly 90 percent seen within months of diagnosis in Western cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-redefining-the-diabetes-diagnosis"&gt;Redefining the diabetes diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of the immune system destroying insulin-making cells, this new subtype looks like something else altogether – an insulin-deficient illness that has not yet revealed its trigger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sits outside type 2 diabetes, which is tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-diabetes-rate-has-doubled-reaching-over-800-million/"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t match malnutrition-related diabetes either. Clinicians had their suspicions; now the data back them up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These new research findings confirm our long-standing suspicion. We have always wondered why many young people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes manage to survive without insulin, at least for some time, which would be unusual in typical type 1 diabetes,” said Dr Jean-Claude Katte of the &lt;a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Exeter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-types-of-diabetes"&gt;Types of diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YODA team compared African participants with more than 3,000 children and adolescents from the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.searchfordiabetes.org/dspHome.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth&lt;/a&gt; study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel pattern emerged in a small group of Black American children and was absent in White participants. That split hints at a mix of ancestral roots and environmental factors. It also rules out simple lab error. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every sample was tested with assays calibrated for African populations, and the same pattern appeared across three countries with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/carrots-may-help-manage-diabetes-by-improving-gut-health/"&gt;different diets&lt;/a&gt;, infections, and climates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings are a wake-up call. They challenge our assumptions about type 1 diabetes and show that the disease may present differently in African children and adolescents,” said Professor Moffat Nyirenda, who directs the &lt;a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/units/mrc-uganda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MRC/UVRI–LSHTM&lt;/a&gt; Uganda Research Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We urgently need to deepen our investigations into the biological and environmental factors driving this form of diabetes and ensure our diagnostic and treatment approaches are fit for purpose in African settings.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katte added, “Our next step is to investigate possible causes – ranging from infections and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-this-amount-of-water-per-day-helps-control-blood-sugar-levels-in-people-with-diabetes/"&gt;nutritional factors&lt;/a&gt; to environmental toxins. If we can find the cause, we may be able to prevent new cases and find new treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Eugene Sobngwi of Cameroon’s &lt;a href="https://www.minsante.cm/site/?q=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ministry of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; put it bluntly, saying, “We must invest in context-specific research. If we don’t, we risk misdiagnosing and mistreating millions of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-globally"&gt;What this means globally&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly nine million people worldwide live with type 1 diabetes. If two out of every three young patients in parts of Africa actually have a different disease, the global numbers – and the research priorities that follow – need a hard look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mislabeling matters. Classic type 1 patients need lifelong insulin from day one; those with the new subtype may respond to therapies that protect or boost their still-working beta cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching that difference could spare families the cost and risk of unnecessary high-dose insulin while steering researchers toward fresh &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forgotten-organ-spleen-bioreactor-could-revolutionize-diabetes-therapy-forever/"&gt;prevention strategies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diagnosing-diabetes-type"&gt;Diagnosing diabetes type&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study leaves open questions. Autoantibodies can fade, so testing closer to the time of diagnosis could capture more detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, teasing apart infections, dietary patterns, and possible toxins will take careful fieldwork and, just as importantly, local funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the path is clear: broaden the research lens, update diagnostic manuals, and train healthcare teams to spot red flags – such as a young patient who stays stable on surprisingly little insulin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The YODA data show that those cases are not rare outliers; they are part of a hidden majority in several African settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes textbooks will need an update, but the bigger story is about equity in science. Decades of work built on narrow datasets can miss whole chapters of human biology. Broadening the map doesn’t just help the regions being studied; it fine-tunes medicine for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(25)00120-2/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Diabetes &amp;amp; Endocrinology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2025 01:44:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPbF9JRHpuUmRpMHJxZl9USlRySGt5N1pFWktWSTN5bEFIZDlaaFhDUnJhZG9od2EyS0NkTjNEdUNkVDVqa2V0WFMwek1hT2oyTF9MN1NmTnVRTVVRU19nbUdMZVA4blJJdHUzZ2l3ZWVYbEQ0cS1GVWYzcFRKYkVKVzhoMUlLaTdyMi1nSmhDQ09yY2Y2NDNPYUV3ajMxWUxsenJBWEw5a3N0WEk</guid></item><item><title>哥伦比亚河让游泳者感到痒。三城先驱报（ Tri-City Herald ）的注意事项 | Columbia River giving swimmers the itch.

Their eggs contaminate the birds’ droppings, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/latest-news/ukh602/picture261490357/alternates/FREE_1140/Gosling%20on%20the%20Grow.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/latest-news/ukh602/picture261490357/alternates/FREE_960/Gosling%20on%20the%20Grow.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/latest-news/ukh602/picture261490357/alternates/FREE_768/Gosling%20on%20the%20Grow.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/latest-news/ukh602/picture261490357/alternates/FREE_640/Gosling%20on%20the%20Grow.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/latest-news/ukh602/picture261490357/alternates/FREE_480/Gosling%20on%20the%20Grow.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.tri-cityherald.com/latest-news/ukh602/picture261490357/alternates/FREE_1140/Gosling%20on%20the%20Grow.jpg" alt="A gaggle of goslings cross Paul Parish Drive toward the green grass of the Columbia Park Golf Tri-Plex by the Columbia River in Kennewick." title="Gosling on the Grow.jpg" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                            &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            A gaggle of goslings cross Paul Parish Drive toward the green grass of the Columbia Park Golf Tri-Plex by the Columbia River in Kennewick.

They multiply and develop in the snail, before being released as a different type of microscopic larvae in the water to repeat the lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They search out a bird or mammal as a host, but can mistakenly burrow into human skin where they do not survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is not contagious, so there is no requirement that medical professionals report it to the health district. But district health professionals have heard anecdotal reports of swimmer’s itch this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one report was linked to playing in shallow river water in a Richland park where ducks or geese gather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials recommend not feeding ducks or geese in areas where people swim, and staying out of marshy areas where snails are often found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children are most often affected by swimmer’s itch, since they tend to wade and play in shallow water, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also are less likely to towel dry themselves after being in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent the larvae from burrowing into skin, showering or towel drying is recommended immediately after leaving the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunscreen applied before going into the water also can help prevent swimmer’s itch by blocking the skin’s pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Treating swimmer’s itch&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms may appear within minutes of swimming in contaminated water and itching may last for up to a week or more before it gradually goes away, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the itch is related to an allergic reaction, the more often people are exposed to contaminated water, the more intense and immediate the symptoms, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases don’t require medical attention. But to relieve the itch, the CDC recommends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="21" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use corticosteroid cream&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply cool compresses to the affected areas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bathe in Epsom salts or baking soda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soak in colloidal oatmeal baths&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply baking soda paste to the rash (made by stirring water into baking soda until it reaches a paste-like consistency)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If itching is severe, a health care provider may recommend a prescription-strength lotion or cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snails that are associated with swimmer’s itch can live in fresh or salt water. But there is no risk of swimmer’s itch in a well maintained and chlorinated swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-110" class="zone zone-el" index="24" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;July 21, 2025 at 6:37 PM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;div class="related-stories story-module"&gt;

The infections are mostly caused by the consumption of contaminated raw or undercooked seafood, when an open wound comes into contact with the bacteria-infected coastal waters, or when someone swallows the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the deaths due to the bacteria occurred in Bay, Broward, Hillsborough and St. Johns counties. Other cases have been confirmed in Duval, Escambia, Lee, Manatee, Santa Rosa and Walton counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria pose a high risk to individuals with weak immune systems or chronic health conditions. "People who are most at risk are immunocompromised — people with cirrhosis, people on chemo, anybody who has a compromised immune system of any kind," said Dr. Edward Hirsch, an infectious disease specialist at HCA Florida University Hospital, to CBS NEWS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the &lt;keyword id="27905887" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-Vibrio-Vulnificus" source="keywords"&gt;symptoms of Vibrio Vulnificus&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

With open wounds, symptoms can be discolouration, swelling, skin breakdown and ulcers. According to Hirsch, "It progresses to making a hole in whatever part of your body got infected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is Vibrio Vulnificus a flesh-eating bacteria?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria don't eat, but kill the tissue. It can not penetrate unharmed skin, but if it enters through an existing break- like a wound, it can cause necrotizing fasciitis, and the flesh around the infection site could die. Then, according to the CDC, the infected site could require a major surgery or even limb amputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent Vibrio Vulnificus infections?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

			&lt;p&gt;Dogs really can be trained to smell  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="168151" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease, according to new research from the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a double blind trial, a Golden Retriever and a Labrador were able to sniff out which skin swabs came from people with Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smell of the oily secretions seemed to hold secret clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dogs in this study achieved high sensitivity and specificity and showed there is an olfactory signature distinct to patients with the disease," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; animal behavioral scientist Nicola Rooney from the University of Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sensitivity levels of 70 percent and 80 percent are well above chance, and I believe that dogs could help us to develop a quick, non-invasive, and cost-effective method to identify patients with Parkinson's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dogs-smell-is-tightly-linked-to-the-visual-parts-of-their-brain?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Dogs Might Actually 'See' Through Smells, Brain Scans Suggest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is no definitive early test for Parkinson's, which is why scientists are so interested in finding potential biomarkers of the disease on our skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168154" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/peanutsniff-article.jpg" alt="Dog Parkinson's Test" class="wp-image-168154 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168154" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A dog smelling a skin swab from a person with or without &lt;span&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/span&gt; disease. &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;(Medical Detection Dogs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knowledge that Parkinson's distinctly changes a person's body odor first came to light roughly a decade ago – all because of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-woman-can-smell-parkinson-s-and-could-be-the-key-to-an-early-detection-test"&gt;one woman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve years before her husband's diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, Joy Milne could &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/magazine/parkinsons-smell-disease-detection.html"&gt;sense&lt;/a&gt; something was off – specifically, she could &lt;i&gt;smell&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milne, a Scottish nurse, is known as a 'super-smeller', and in 2016, she became famous among neuroscientists for her extraordinary abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a small &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(15)00396-8"&gt;pilot study&lt;/a&gt;, Milne correctly identified each patient with Parkinson's disease based solely on the scent of their shirts. Her one misidentification &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/magazine/parkinsons-smell-disease-detection.html"&gt;turned out to be correct&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news raised an important question: If someone like Milne could smell Parkinson's years before it was diagnosed, could a dog do the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs are known to have incredible senses of smell, far more powerful than our own. Previous studies have found our pets can smell &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-body-smells-when-its-stressed-and-your-dog-can-sniff-it-out"&gt;our stress&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dogs-deployed-at-helsinki-airport-can-detect-covid-19-with-near-perfect-accuracy"&gt;coronavirus infections&lt;/a&gt;, and even our &lt;a href="https://www.roswellpark.org/cancertalk/202008/can-dogs-smell-cancer"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; – so if a distinct odor for Parkinson's does exist, then maybe a dog can sniff it out, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, a few &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.29180"&gt;preliminary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-024-01902-5"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; have provided evidence for that hypothesis. But some only gave limited information on how the dogs were trained and tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168156" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/bumper-article.jpg" alt="Dog Smelling Parkinson's" class="size-full wp-image-168156" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168156" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A golden retriever smelling a skin swab. &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;(Medical Detection Dogs)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent trial from the UK is a collaboration between a program called Medical Detection Dogs and neuroscientists at the University of Manchester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One goal of the research is to figure out what the dogs are actually smelling, and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, for instance, researchers at Manchester helped &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00879"&gt;identify&lt;/a&gt; which odor compounds set the distinctive smell of Parkinson's apart. Their results were later confirmed by Milne, the serendipitous "super-smeller".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years on, the odor compounds were used to create a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-means-parkinsons-could-be-diagnosed-with-a-swab-in-just-3-minutes"&gt;diagnostic 'swab test'&lt;/a&gt; for Parkinson's, currently in testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, further down the road, trained dogs could help neuroscientists identify more unique biomarkers of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, though, not all canines are up to snuff. In the current trial, only 2 out of 10 dogs made it through training, and neither performed perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dog, for instance, falsely flagged a tenth of the odor swabs from healthy people as having Parkinson's. The other gave false alarms less than 2 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, however, the dogs could smell which person had Parkinson's at a rate well above chance, providing proof of principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are extremely proud to say that once again, dogs can very accurately detect disease," &lt;a href="https://bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/july/detection-dogs.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Claire Guest, the CEO of Medical Detection Dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is currently no early test for Parkinson's disease and symptoms may start up to 20 years before they become visible and persistent leading to a confirmed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Timely diagnosis is key… "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1877718X251342485"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journal of Parkinson's Disease&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But nearly all of the 10 panelists bucked medical consensus on the drugs’ safety and emphasized what they said were risks of taking the drugs while pregnant — such as causing autism, miscarriages or birth defects. In some cases, they claimed that antidepressants don’t work at all and that depression goes away on its own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d91b73" class="body-graf"&gt;Three of the 10 panelists were from outside the United States. Another runs a clinic to help people taper off of psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-705f71" class="body-graf"&gt;“They were really rousing concerns about safety that are not evidence-based or established and not at all balanced with concerns about the risks of untreated depression,” said Dr. Joseph Goldberg, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-28e326" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Payne, director of the Reproductive Psychiatry Research Program at the University of Virginia, said, “I’m disappointed that the FDA brought people in from outside of the United States when there’s so many experts here in the United States who truly know this [medical] literature inside and out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ecf419" class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the FDA said in a statement that the claim that the panel was one-sided was “insulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers who dedicate their expertise to these panels.” The spokesperson added that FDA Commissioner Martin Makary “has an interest in ensuring policies reflect the latest gold standard science and protect public health.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb248a" class="body-graf"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-ssri-antidepressants-children-doctors-risks-studies-rcna192722" target="_blank"&gt;called for a probe into the risks of antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/rfk-jr-children-dire-chronic-disease-health-report-rcna208544" target="_blank"&gt;“Make America Healthy Again” report in May&lt;/a&gt; claimed there were “potentially major long-term repercussions” associated with use of the drugs in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d89ff" class="body-graf"&gt;The panel discussion focused on a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, which includes Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft. The medications increase levels of serotonin, a chemical messenger in the brain that can improve mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f9556e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists often advise women who are taking SSRIs to continue doing so during pregnancy, since the risks of untreated depression tend to outweigh the potential risks of the medication to mother and child. However, the decision is a personal one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-053b05" class="body-graf"&gt;For ethical reasons, there are no randomized-control trials of SSRIs in pregnant women, meaning data on potential risks mostly comes from observational studies and drug registries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b232c" class="body-graf"&gt;Some babies born to mothers taking SSRIs may develop symptoms such as jitteriness, irritability or difficulty eating or sleeping that resolve quickly — what’s known as “neonatal adaptation syndrome.” The symptoms may be caused by medication in the babies’ systems or withdrawal from it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c32b66" class="body-graf"&gt;Certain studies have also found a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9543237/" target="_blank"&gt;slightly elevated risk of miscarriage&lt;/a&gt; associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy, though others have found &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/1656691" target="_blank"&gt;no association&lt;/a&gt;. However, there’s no convincing evidence to suggest that SSRIs are linked to autism or birth defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f89ccc" class="body-graf"&gt;“Well-controlled studies continue to not find an association,” Payne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2e139" class="body-graf"&gt;Women with histories of depression are also at an increased risk of symptoms’ recurring during pregnancy, and depression can come with its own risks — including thoughts of self-harm or low birth weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1398cf" class="body-graf"&gt;“The best thing a pregnant individual could do for herself and her baby is to get the treatment that they need,” said Dr. Nancy Byatt, a perinatal psychiatrist at UMass Chan Medical School, who wasn’t part of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2da935" class="body-graf"&gt;In addition to raising concerns about side effects, several panelists questioned the efficacy of antidepressants or suggested that data favoring the use of SSRIs was manipulated by the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810182" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s been said that SSRIs help people who are severely depressed. They don’t,” said David Healy, an FDA panelist and fellow at the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-96fb04" class="body-graf"&gt;Goldberg and other psychiatrists said that’s simply untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1816ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“You can say the moon landing was faked. Conspiracy theories abound in our world. But there is not a doubt about whether SSRIs work,” said Goldberg, a past president of the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology who has previously consulted for pharmaceutical companies. He said he was invited to join the FDA panel but declined because the language of the invitation suggested it wouldn’t be a fair discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3c6621" class="body-graf"&gt;Healy, the panelist, also claimed that some people “recover spontaneously” from depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b538fa" class="body-graf"&gt;Another panelist, psychologist Roger McFillin — who hosts a podcast that challenges conventional mental health advice — suggested that depression wasn’t an illness but rather a product of “women just naturally experiencing their emotions more intensely.” He added, without evidence, that many women feel coerced into taking antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-78bd4e" class="body-graf"&gt;Psychiatrists who weren’t part of the discussion broadly decried those characterizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0874d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“I have never, ever, ever, ever heard of a third party pushing a prescription in pregnancy,” Goldberg said. However, he said he is aware of some obstetrician-gynecologists who aren’t as familiar with SSRIs who have wrongly told pregnant patients to stop taking the medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b26af8" class="body-graf"&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Monday that SSRIs can be lifesaving for some pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-792417" class="body-graf"&gt;“Today’s FDA panel on SSRIs and pregnancy was alarmingly unbalanced and did not adequately acknowledge the harms of untreated perinatal mood disorders in pregnancy,” it said. “On a panel of 10 experts, only one spoke to the importance of SSRIs in pregnancy as a critical tool, among others, in preventing the potentially devastating effects of anxiety and depression when left untreated during pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0dfc4f" class="body-graf"&gt;One panelist, Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross, a psychiatrist and an OB-GYN at the University of Florida College of Medicine, was the most vocal advocate for using SSRIs, often pushing back against others’ assessments of the risks. Psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel praised her science-backed commentary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-853c96" class="body-graf"&gt;“All of us can find a study that agrees with exactly what we think,” Roussos-Ross told the panel. “But we need to look at the data very objectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-032c36" class="body-graf"&gt;Several psychiatrists who weren’t on the panel said they worry that the discussion could lead to regulatory action that makes it harder to access SSRIs. For example, one panelist, Dr. Adam Urato, chief of maternal-fetal medicine at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Massachusetts, called for stronger warnings on SSRI labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-97e619" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“I am just very nervous that some of the discourse around the risks of antidepressants could lead to even more barriers for people seeking care,” said Dr. Lindsay Lebin, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, who wasn’t part of the FDA discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 23:10:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPVjhJUnU3NGh6bEE1M2xTRUNRUmU5WjRuRG5Xc012MHNJWVFfbkxQUGFiZXluc2U4YXpkZ1ctWTl3S0JxaDViOVF3cTNGckoxMEQ5cFRXVDBIaFZvaDJ0WmNZN2l2bVZQSTBXenpGNUVxM2xEeFNEeWVncGRVU3ZvWXJnOTVDXzJJZ2M1WS1udXdIQnN3LVg4QWxtSnNMVm5hRjFJSWt3VlFDUHh0bzJLcldHY0RENldmQWx0dzZXRGN3NV930gFWQVVfeXFMUFhfcmR3NHF0dFBkdGZGMVZaTUVQYU1WVmY5TmgxODJkd3pPS1F4aDBLcHFQM2EtNFUzWVE3aUphUmNHTnZIVS1UOEJqeEExNHpJNXJ3aWc</guid></item><item><title>COVID-19 ：高传播性菌株在一些州引发夏季激增- dailyvoice.com | COVID-19: Highly Transmissible Strains Spark Summer Surge In Some States - dailyvoice.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOV2FZZ1ZJdEFYVElqMVNiQzZRSUswRkM1MklHakFuR2RRc2lZLUZ3Sm1Rc3pWdGxPYXljQ0dRV1hvR1NMZ1g5UDU1OWVKbFF1RWdjSHlQWXU3XzlVdXhDOWtCYjdHcThTX1c3Z05OS0hYajgyRGYtMGxVVFRhdzd4V3d0a0dkNkhVR2IxUnkzYTFLMGpMN0VudlJvcENETm00cC1OMmFsMXJzQWptMmFOejgzWVQyZmhXeHpQNzdrX3I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="e-article-text" data-testid="article-detail-body" js-article-text data-read-smore-words="300"&gt;

All participants were matched based on age, sex, and ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers used blood samples to analyze PFAS levels and found that higher levels increased the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by almost one third. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, each increase in range of PFAS exposure was linked to a 31 percent increase in risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Vishal Midya, who was the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of environmental medicine at Mount Sinai, said: 'Because they don't break down easily, PFAS accumulate in the environment - and in human bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers from Mount Sinai looked at the link between polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) - found in everything from non-stick cookware to food packaging to tap water - and the incidence of type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study is one of the first to examine how these chemicals may disrupt the body's metabolism in ways that increase diabetes risk - particularly in diverse US populations.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the study, the researchers used data from BioMe, an electronic health record-linked biobank of more than 65,000 patients seeking primary care at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From an initial analysis, 180 people recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were selected with this group made up of 33 percent African Americans, 33 percent Hispanics, and 33 percent Whites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These patients were then compared to 180 similar individuals without diabetes. All participants were matched based on age, sex, and ancestry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood plasma samples collected from the individuals before they were diagnosed with diabetes or given the all-clear were used to assess PFAS levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers then applied Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression to the samples. This statistical method is used to analyze the effects of mixtures of chemical exposures on a health outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By using WQS, the team were able to see how PFAS levels in the blood were linked to patients developing diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metabolic alterations, such as insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism, are key contributors to the development of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These changes, often linked to obesity and unhealthy lifestyles, disrupt the body's ability to regulate blood sugar effectively, leading to hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hyperglycemia occurs when the level of sugar in your blood gets too high. Chronic or persistent hyperglycemia can lead to diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of hyperglycemia include feeling thirsty, frequent urination, tiredness and breath that smells fruity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for type 2 typically involves taking insulin several times a day, either by injection or through a pump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS exposure can contribute to diabetes development through several mechanisms, including disrupting cells in the pancreas responsible for regulating blood glucose levels, increasing insulin resistance, and potentially increasing body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers say the new findings underscore the importance of regulating PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author, Dr Damaskini Valvi, said: 'Findings can help us design more effective interventions for the early prevention of type 2 diabetes in the future, taking into account individuals' exposures to environmental chemicals along with other well-known genetic, clinical, and lifestyle factors implicated in diabetes development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mounting research suggests that PFAS are a risk factor for several chronic diseases, such as obesity, liver disease, and diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are microscopic substances that take thousands of years to break down in the environment and human body, earning them the name 'forever chemicals.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their main purpose is to repel water and oil, which is what makes non-stick cookware easier to clean and why certain jackets and tents can withstand rain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The chemicals can seep into the water supply from washing dishes and can enter food if packaging is made to be grease-resistant or if the non-stick coating on pots and pans begins to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PFAS are also common in pesticides used on crops, which produces chemical-rich runoff that can enter the drinking water supply. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no level of safe exposure to the chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Public water systems have four years to implement solutions to reduce PFAS in their water, under orders made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Beginning in 2029, the EPA will police levels of six types of PFAS in drinking water - PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, PFHpA, and PFBS - and systems with unacceptable levels, will be required to notify the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, the EPA set the maximum contaminant levels for PFAS at 4.0 parts per trillion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that US counties where drinking water surpassed this level - such as Nassau, Suffolk, and Rockland in New York and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e0-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, Orange, and Riverside counties in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-a198e0e1-dcef-11ef-9789-f1575e588f54" class=""&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; - had a higher incidence of digestive, endocrine, respiratory, and mouth and throat cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increases in incidence rates ranged from slightly elevated, at two percent, to 'substantially elevated' at 33 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mount Sinai team are now calling for studies involving larger populations, expanding over the life course, in order to better understand the health impacts of PFAS across the lifespan and at vulnerable life periods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;HONOLULU (Island News) – COVID-19 activity is yet again on the rise in Hawaii, according to the latest report from the Hawaii Department of Health (DOH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH’s newest data showed activity at a medium activity level, meaning the virus is circulating at higher levels than would be expected based on historic trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test positivity rate was reported to be 12.4% as of July 19, which is up from 10.9% from the previous week. According to officials, the 7-day average of new cases also rose on all islands over the last month through July 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increase reminds us that COVID-19 remains a health concern in the community. At the moment, COVID-19 is outpacing the flu and RSV in test positivity, emergency room visits and hospital admissions,” DOH stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH advises the public to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-image layout-horizontal  subscriber-hide  tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-image tnt-inline-relation-child tnt-inline-presentation-default tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-half"&gt;&lt;figure class="photo layout-horizontal hover-expand letterbox-style-blur"&gt;&lt;span class="expand hidden-print" data-toggle="modal" data-photo-target=".photo-3d6e4780-c743-4a74-a38e-43b05d92cb80" data-instance="#gallery-items-1c7a32d4-d866-44e6-98d0-5d3549d19c93-photo-modal" data-target="#photo-carousel-1c7a32d4-d866-44e6-98d0-5d3549d19c93"&gt;

        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Get the shot&lt;/strong&gt;: DOH encourages everyone age 6 months and older to get vaccinated during the current COVID-19 surge. DOH recommends the 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccine particularly for the following higher-risk populations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children age 6 months to 2 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Individuals age 2 years to 64 years who are immunocompromised (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval of 2 months; and may receive additional doses in discussion with their healthcare provider)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adults age 65 years or older (2 doses separated by 6 months with a minimum interval 2 of months)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pregnant women&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare workers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Stay home when sick&lt;/strong&gt;: Stay home if you’re feeling sick and return to usual activities only if fever-free for at least 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medicines, and symptoms are improving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Cover your cough&lt;/strong&gt;: Covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze helps stop the spread of germs that make you and others sick. If you don’t have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve, not your hands. Clean your hands after coughing or sneezing by washing with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Mask up&lt;/strong&gt;: Properly wearing a well-fitted mask when you have or are recovering from COVID-19 symptoms and are indoors with other people can help prevent spread of illness to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Get a test&lt;/strong&gt;: Take a COVID-19 test if you have symptoms and might need treatment because you are at higher risk for severe infection. Many respiratory viruses have similar symptoms, but treatments differ. Antiviral treatments for COVID-19 can prevent hospitalization and death. Treatment works best when taken as soon as possible after symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/docd/" target="_blank"&gt;View additional strategies on how to reduce COVID-19 and other respiratory disease spread, here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The public is reminded to take reasonable precautions to avoid getting sick. Consult your doctor about vaccinations for yourself and your family,” DOH added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-asset inline-article  subscriber-hide tnt-inline-asset tnt-inline-relcontent tnt-inline-article tnt-inline-relation-sibling tnt-inline-presentation-summary tnt-inline-alignment-center tnt-inline-width-two-thirds"&gt;&lt;article id="card-summary-5b222ac3-4d31-5266-82e0-e08eda4346cb" class="tnt-asset-type-article clearfix card summary has-image  letterbox-style-blur  tnt-section-news"&gt;

In another video, the medical doctor &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dramyshah/video/7493296635120766254?lang=en" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;@dramyshah&lt;/a&gt; calls it a “game-changer” and says it can decrease disease and boost mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking “is an effective, time-efficient method of increasing cardiovascular fitness,” says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.apta.org/need-help-contact-apta/media-inquiries/apta-media-corps" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Scott Capozza, PT&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the American Physical Therapy Association who’s based in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In essence, increasing the intensity of your walking speed gives you more bang for your buck, which can improve your cardiovascular system,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Is Japanese Walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese walking involves alternating three minutes of fast walking and three minutes of slower walking for 30 minutes, four days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Japanese study of this technique, published in 2007, gave the method the “Japanese walking” moniker. It found that this workout &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/hypertension/living-with/lifestyle-changes-help-you-lower-blood-pressure/" data-component-name=""&gt;lowered blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, strengthened leg muscles, and boosted aerobic health for middle-aged and older people — compared with those who walked at steady, moderate paces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fast walking” means moving at about 70 percent of your maximum effort, whereas slow walking is 40 percent effort, says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="http://movementmanagedpt.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Lindsy Jackson, DPT, PT&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist and owner of Movement Managed in Littleton, New Hampshire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can measure this using a fitness tracker or heart rate monitor, says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://ahs.uic.edu/profiles/arena-ross/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Ross Arena, PhD, PT&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and head of the physical therapy department at the University of Illinois in Chicago. But if you don’t have a fitness tracker, there are other ways to ensure you’re walking briskly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you walk fast, you should be breathing harder,” Dr. Arena says. “You shouldn’t be able to comfortably have a conversation with somebody during the fast pace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential Benefits of Japanese Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Interval walking method “boosts cardiovascular fitness and burns more calories than steady-paced walking,” says &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://baptisthealth.net/doctors/sergiu-darabant/1597499" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name=""&gt;Sergiu Darabant, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist with Miami Cardiac and Vascular Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida. “It can improve endurance and fitness capacity in a shorter amount of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several recent studies back this up. A small study published in 2025 examining the impact of interval walking training in people over 70 found that after five months, subjects had increased leg strength and improved blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research published in 2023 found that interval walking improved cholesterol and physical fitness for people with &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/type-2-diabetes/living-with/great-exercises-for-people-with-diabetes/" data-component-name=""&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2024, individuals over 65 were randomly assigned to do interval walking or a moderate-intensity continuous walking regimen. After eight weeks, the interval walking group showed stronger endurance and flexibility, but both groups had improved body composition, emotional health, sleep quality, cognitive function, and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="view-sources"&gt;&lt;button class="view-sources__link" type="button"&gt;[&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating faster-walking intervals enables you to “stretch your system,” Arena says, so your body has to work harder, which can increase your fitness levels, boost your metabolic health, and decrease your risk for disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternating your walking pace also “keeps workouts dynamic,” Dr. Jackson says, adding that it reduces the monotony of steady walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arena notes that you’d likely get heightened benefits from other &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/high-intensity-interval-training/guide/" data-component-name=""&gt;interval workouts&lt;/a&gt;, such as those incorporating running or cycling, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Try Japanese Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking is an accessible form of cardio, Dr. Darabant says. “It requires no equipment, can be done anywhere, and suits a wide range of fitness levels,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts offer these tips for trying Japanese walking:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wear comfortable shoes.&lt;/strong&gt; “I tell my patients I’m giving them permission to go shoe shopping when starting a walking program,” Capozza says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a time that works for you.&lt;/strong&gt; Walk in the morning if you’re a morning person or in the evening if that’s best for you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab a buddy.&lt;/strong&gt; Walking with someone else can help keep you accountable, Capozza suggests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warm up.&lt;/strong&gt; Jackson recommends starting any interval walking routine with five minutes of slow walking to prep your muscles and joints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start slowly.&lt;/strong&gt; If you’re not accustomed to physical activity, Arena suggests sticking with slower-paced walking for a while and then building up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a plan.&lt;/strong&gt; Start with three minutes of fast walking where you’re slightly out of breath and three minutes of slow walking, Jackson says. Repeat these intervals four or five times, and walk three to five days a week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track your progress.&lt;/strong&gt; Use your phone or a fitness tracker to track your walking intensity and how often you do it, Darabant says. Then, gradually increase your intensity and duration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrate.&lt;/strong&gt; Drink plenty of water, especially if you’re walking outside in the heat, Arena says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to your body.&lt;/strong&gt; Stop walking if you feel any pain or become extra winded, and talk to your doctor before starting again, Jackson suggests.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who Should (and Shouldn’t) Try Japanese Walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone striving to increase their overall fitness level can benefit from interval walking, Capozza says. Darabant adds that it’s also good for those wanting to &lt;a class="cr-anchor" href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-and-nutrition/diet/tips-weight-loss-actually-work/" data-component-name=""&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; or challenge themselves with a higher-intensity workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s especially useful for people who are short on time but want a more efficient form of exercise,” Darabant says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you have a history of heart or lung problems or difficulty balancing, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program, Capozza says. Also, avoid working out intensely (or check with a healthcare provider first) if you have an injury or recent surgery, Jackson adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who don’t typically exercise should start slowly and ease into the fast-walking intervals, Arena says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line on Japanese Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is good for your health long term, and incorporating fast-paced intervals can enhance these benefits, Capozza says. Any activity where you “move more and sit less is a tremendous health benefit,” Arena adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Everyday Health</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 22:25:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPR0c2VnpoSDFrb2RlUTVHcGhjdGk2ZmRjbmRhbUpMZUlZdk5zaTNXTExyOXpZY3dVMGhMMU9kNzFfXzVRNlFCWDI2MWF5eTBZcTNDanZBVWd4clVJcVd5S2NfaF9faDRQVm1mc2dVSm9waUhqczFoR2FmSzRMMDdNd1pSTlRBcnQzTVpKc0dpUVdXX1Z1UXc</guid></item><item><title>常用药物是否会悄然增加您患痴呆症的风险？ - WWLTV.com | Could common medications be quietly raising your risk of Dementia? - WWLTV.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi2wFBVV95cUxOaWExV0lidmFORUg0QmNES0R2UFo1M0NOMGtMMGNWMDNMTnNSWUFDU2tkaENTUmZYZWlSbDM1QWtyREpKQmFJdHBmcU1NVEFJb2xhbFBJQ1RBeHNDcVZxbzVkd05zdWttYUNaaUVpQ3BEdUE4bW9qeF85WDFUczVjRWRPa0ZvVmRXMnN3d1EzVXhlZTBzTGhoSTFQT0pKdUMySDRzNmtNQ2M4OUtlMkpiWnJpUlBtTG1vUlhjcTlBZjBHbnhpS1lUcllBNG8zQ0d0enZyZXctNy1HU2M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;As we age, the contents of our medicine cabinet may need a rethink—some everyday drugs, including cold remedies and anxiety meds, could be affecting brain health&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEW ORLEANS — Could frequent use of some cold and allergy medications, and many other common drugs, like those for anxiety, increase your risk of dementia?&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We explore that question and why, as you age, you need to change what's in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors are aware of it, but patients are most likely not. Certain over-the-counter and prescription medications could increase your risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We've known about the risk of memory, thinking disorders with these medications for decades,” said Tulane Neurologist Dr. Michele Longo, who has a special interest in memory disorders and sees patients at the UMC Healthy Brain Aging Institute.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medications fall into two classes:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First: Anticholinergic drugs, like some sleep aids and antihistamines like Benadryl, and prescriptions for overactive bladder, asthma, COPD, sleep aids, and motion sickness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second: benzodiazepines like alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan) for anxiety, insomnia, and muscle spasms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They've been around for a long time. They are probably one of the more commonly prescribed medications,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that when you stop taking the benzos, memory issues tend to go back to normal, but strong anticholinergic drug use is consistently associated with an increased risk of dementia, even after you stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons age makes a difference in the medication you take and how much of it you take is that as we get older, our systems slow down, allowing medications to stay in our bodies for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we age, we have to reconsider, look at the medicines and say, ‘Alright, does the benefit of this medicine still outweigh the risks of that medicine?’ And that balance shifts as we age.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And don't think that just because a drug is over-the-counter, it means there is no risk.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything that is marketed in the drug store to help with sleep. You know, I tell my patients to look for “PM.” If it says “PM,” we've got to look closely. Ask the pharmacist,” Dr. Longo recommended.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, she says, bring a list of all the medications you take to your annual exam and let your doctor guide you.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some doctors suggest that non-drowsy antihistamines, such as Claritin or Zyrtec, may be safer options for allergies, particularly for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

While HIV infection rates have remained fairly stable, syphilis shows the biggest increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1 in 5 Americans live with such an infection at any given time, with health care costs estimated in the billions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And with summer, rates tend to climb, which a &lt;a href="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.invigormedical.com/lifestyle/std-infection-rates-by-county-state/"&gt;new analysis&lt;/a&gt; using CDC data by Invigor Medical attributes to increased social activity, travel and sexual behavior when the weather’s warmer. But there are other factors, including varying levels of access to health care, different levels of sexual health education, differences in screening and its utilization and persistent social and economic factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Invigor Medical reports chlamydia is the most prevalent STD, with more than 1.6 million new cases in 2023, especially prominent among young women. Gonorrhea cases nearly doubled in the decade, to roughly 595,000. Syphilis increased sixfold from 34,279 cases to more than 205,000, though that may be a little misleading. Before 2018, the CDC didn’t include late-stage or unknown stage syphilis in its counts. Even so, the report said if you exclude those cases, the count still tripled over the decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That’s all bad news. The good news, per the report, is the epidemic of sexually transmitted infections may be slowing. Per the report, “While syphilis infections remain at record highs, reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV have declined from their peak levels in previous years, signaling a promising shift in the trajectory of the nation’s STD burden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Men-vs.-women-and-infection-rates" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Men vs. women and infection rates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The analysis found that women are about 10% more likely to be diagnosed with an STD, compared to men. Among those 13 and older, there were 902 reported infections per 100,000 women, compared to 819 per 100,000 men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The gap is most pronounced for adolescents and young adults, per the report, which said that there are biological differences that make women more susceptible, but it could also be a case of doing a better job of counting. Women are more likely to be screened and screened younger during routine reproductive health visits. Men tend to be tested if they have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="State-by-state-count" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;State by state count&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The highest counts of STDs are currently found in the South, with Louisiana and Mississippi reporting the highest rates at 1,201.6 and 1,084.5 cases per 100,000, respectively. Two other states also report STD rates above 1,000 per 100,000: Alaska (1066.6) and Georgia (1020.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="1450" data-height="1200"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=662" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/7W57DCSSCFFV5JOTCXG6USQFXM.jpg?auth=e58f70ca76e843310403c18f51155d9d13e8636ab251fc1455dec3c491c9173b&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1324 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt; Invigor Medical &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The other Southern states in the top 10 are Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina and Arkansas, while New York and South Dakota also make that top 10 list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;New England states typically have the lowest STD rates, per the report. Vermont (241). New Hampshire (251.1) and Maine (276.6) have one-fourth the infection rate of those in the highest burden states. “New England states tend to be older and have less ethnic diversity, both of which are associated with lower STD risk,” per Invigor Medical. The region also tends to have higher median income and a lower uninsured rate, so it’s easier to get tested and treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Filling out the bottom 10, Oregon ranks No. 41, Connecticut, No. 42 and Montana No. 43. Utah ranks No. 44 for states with highest rates of sexually transmitted disease, then Wyoming (No. 45), Idaho (No. 46), and West Virginia (No. 47).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Utah-STD-numbers" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Utah STD numbers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2023, Utah had 429.6 newly reported STD cases per 100,000 residents, making it seventh-best in terms of having low STD rates. Nationally, there were 746.7 cases per 100,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Of those cases in Utah, chlamydia accounted for 11,004, for a rate of 322 per 100,000, making its chlamydia rate seventh-lowest in the U.S. The national chlamydia rate was 492.2 per 100,000 with 1,648,568 new cases total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;There were 77.9 new gonorrhea cases in Utah per 100,000 residents, eighth-lowest. In all, there were 2,664 new cases. Nationally, the 601,319 cases created a rate of 179.5 cases per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah was sixth-lowest for syphilis, with a rate of 24.2 cases per 100,000 residents and 828 total cases.

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBIA, S.C. — The South Carolina Department of Public Health (SCDPH) is confirming a case of brain-eating amoeba in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case of Naegleria fowleri--the scientific term for the amoeba--was identified the week of July 7th but the agency hasn't said where in the state it was found.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 started looking into these claims after reports circulated in local Facebook groups suggesting a child in the Midlands may have died from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News19 reached out to the Centers for Disease Control, local hospitals, several coroner's offices, and the state's environmental department, but no one could confirm a death or a specific location.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCDPH did confirm the case but said it's not required to be reported to their agency. "The agency does not track infections from the amoeba and does not provide information about or comment on individual cases, including the person's condition," SCDPH officials clarified in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amoeba can be found in warm freshwater but occasionally has been detected in tap water. The agency stresses that infections are extremely rare, with fewer than 10 cases a year in the U.S. However, those cases are usually deadly.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the amoeba are naturally occurring, there is no way to prevent them in lakes or rivers. The amoeba is only life-threatening if it goes up the nose and to the brain. It is not delay if ingested through the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC says early symptoms of the amoeba infection include fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Those cases usually progress rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania Department of Health has criminalized nitazenes, a class of synthetic opioids that can be even stronger than fentanyl, as overdose deaths in the state mount.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes are temporarily labeled a Class I controlled substance as of Saturday, meaning it’s illegal to possess, distribute or manufacture them in the state. The action puts Pennsylvania in line with federal policy.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interim label can last up to two years. In its announcement, the Department of Health said it’s taking steps to place nitazenes in Class I permanently.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scheduling nitazenes, which have no acceptable medical use, as Class I substances provides law enforcement with the authority to crack down on its possession and distribution in Pennsylvania,” said Secretary of Health Debra Bogen. “Meanwhile, our focus remains on developing strategies that help connect people with substance use disorder with treatment and other resources.”

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes were first developed in the 1950s as an alternative to morphine, but were never approved for medical use. They were an obscure domain of pharmacological researchers until spilling into the illicit drug market in 2019.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes have continued to become more prevalent in the state’s illicit drug supply, according to the department, contributing to 45 deaths in Pennsylvania since 2023.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opioids remain the leading cause of fatal overdoses in the state and across the country. In 2023, 3,757 Pennsylvanians died of an overdose involving opioids, 3,470 of which were at least partly attributed to fentanyl.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other opioids, overdose reversal medications such as Narcan should be administered in cases of nitazene overdose.

&lt;/p&gt;

Analyzing data from over 3 million individuals, researchers found that while heredity increases risk, most diagnosed individuals do not have affected relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges stigma and clarifies that mental disorders arise from complex genetic and environmental factors. The findings highlight the need for both personalized and population-level approaches to mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family History Rare:&lt;/strong&gt; 89% of people with schizophrenia have no close relative with the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Causes:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental illness stems from many small genetic variations plus environment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Outlook:&lt;/strong&gt; Even with family history, most people never develop a mental disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&lt;strong&gt;t is a common belief that mental illness ‘runs in families’. And while it is true that heredity plays a role, in reality, the vast majority of cases – such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and borderline personality disorder – occur in people without any known hereditary predisposition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a major new study by researchers at the Danish Center for Register-Based Research, Aarhus University, recently published in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Lancet Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111838"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a tree." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/mental-health-family-neurosicene-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;So while the study supports that heredity is a factor, it also makes clear that heredity is unpredictable and complex, he adds: Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is based on data from over 3 million Danes, and the researchers hope it will help alleviate concerns and reduce stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, people are most worried about what they see among close relatives. Very few go around fearing they’ll develop schizophrenia unless they have a relative with the condition. But this study clearly shows that all of us have a risk of developing mental illness,” says Professor Carsten Bøcker Pedersen, who co-authored the study with Professor Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eighty-nine percent of people diagnosed with schizophrenia have no history of the disorder among close relatives. So it’s far from something that only occurs in affected families,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar pattern is seen with depression: 60% of individuals who experience depression have no relatives with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does my mother’s illness mean for me?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study raises an important question: If most mental illnesses occur in people without a relative with the same condition, how do they arise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers can’t give a precise answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mental disorders are hereditary, but they are also highly polygenic. They often result from many small genetic variations, not a single ‘disease gene.’ Additionally, environment and chance also play a role,” explains Professor Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the study is groundbreaking because it describes the absolute risk – how many out of 100 people will develop a specific mental disorder in their lifetime. This functions like an atlas, helping individuals understand, for example, the statistical implication of having a mother with a mental illness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope the data can help nuance the narrative for families affected by highly heritable conditions like schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your father or sister has schizophrenia, it does not mean you will necessarily develop it. In fact, the study shows that 92% of people with a first-degree relative with schizophrenia do not develop the disorder themselves,” says Carsten Bøcker Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the study supports that heredity is a factor, it also makes clear that heredity is unpredictable and complex, he adds:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have a parent or sibling who has had depression, your risk of developing depression is around 15% – while your risk is under 5% if you have no close relatives with the condition. But that also means you still have an 85% chance of not developing the illness, even if it appears in your immediate family. That’s an important message.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Digging into old church records&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used Danish national registries to link individuals and their mental health diagnoses across generations. The study draws on the Civil Registration System, the Multigeneration Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the National Patient Register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone diagnosed in psychiatric care between January 1970 and December 2021 is included in the study – but all data is pseudonymized, meaning that researchers never accessed personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carsten Bøcker Pedersen and Esben Agerbo are key figures behind the Multigeneration Register, which they are developing in collaboration with the Danish National Archives. The register links family relationship data from the Civil Registration System with historical information from church records, tracing Danish family links back to 1920.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Multigeneration Register provides a powerful foundation for further studies on how heredity and family structure influence health in Denmark – such as the development of mental illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study points to the need for a dual-track approach to addressing mental illness. One track involves personalized medicine, considering individual genetics and environment. The other involves population-wide measures, such as reducing societal stressors, lowering alcohol consumption, and promoting mental well-being,” says Esben Agerbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both are essential if we are to prevent and understand mental illness – in both individuals with mentally ill relatives and the majority for whom the illness arises without a family history,” he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About the research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The study is a prospective cohort study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Investigated disorders: substance abuse, cannabis abuse, alcohol abuse, schizophrenia and related disorders, schizoaffective psychosis, affective disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, personality disorders, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborators: Danish National Archives, University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University Hospital&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;External funding: Novo Nordisk Foundation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#afd9c6cdcac1efceda81cbc4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vibe Noordeloos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://au.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aarhus University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Vibe Noordeloos – Aarhus University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(25)00196-8/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Absolute and relative risks of mental disorders in families: a Danish register-based study”&lt;/a&gt; by Carsten Bøcker Pedersen et al. &lt;em&gt;LancetPsychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Absolute and relative risks of mental disorders in families: a Danish register-based study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relative risk estimates of familial aggregation of many types of mental disorders are available, but absolute risk estimates of familial aggregation of mental disorders remain sparse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proportion of individuals who develop a mental disorder in the absence of the same disorder in a relative (non-familial cases) has not been examined. We aimed to create comprehensive risk estimates of the familial aggregation of mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this prospective cohort study, we followed people of Danish origin between Jan 1, 1970, and Dec 31, 2021. We used Danish population-based registers to link individuals and their mental health across extended family pedigrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These registers include the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Multi Generation Register, the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register, and the Danish National Patient Register. Mental disorders investigated were substance use disorder, cannabis use disorder, alcohol use disorder, schizophrenia and related disorders, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorders, bipolar disorder, single and recurrent depressive disorders (depression), personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We estimated lifetime risk (risk up to age 60 years), age-specific absolute risk, and relative risk for each mental disorder and type of affected relative (eg first, second, or third-degree relatives). We calculated heritability estimates and the proportion of non-familial cases. We involved people with related lived experience in the study design and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 3 048 583 individuals (1 486 132 [48·75%] females and 1 562 451 [51·25%] males) were followed up for 80 425 971 person-years. Individuals with a family member with a specific type of mental disorder had higher lifetime and relative risks of developing the same type of mental disorder. Both lifetime and relative risks were higher the closer the affected kinship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the lifetime risk of depression was 15·48% (95% CI 15·31–15·65) in individuals with affected first-degree relatives, 13·50% (13·25–13·75) in individuals with affected second-degree relatives, 7·80% (7·76–7·84) in the general population, and 4·68% (4·65–4·71) in individuals without affected first-degree and second-degree relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heritability for depression was 45·4% (95% CI 44·8–46·0) and the proportion of non-familial cases constituted 60·0% (95% CI 59·8–60·2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with family members with a mental disorder face increased risks of the same disorder. From a population perspective, most mental disorders occur in individuals without affected close relatives, thus highlighting the need for prevention strategies which target the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Translation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Danish translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 21:25:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE52MWQxOHpheHp6a2VRUjJlel9MdnVKcC1wcHJMU3pPZ2VvRVM3eWEtR19POExaQVhYcXo0MGxESlQ3dGlxTk1wZEZkTDdYR28yLW9uV3loeVBabkNhWGxwb2plM0l0d1FQRXJpQnAwaW4yQUE</guid></item><item><title>这位女士在了解了“肌肉跨度”后逆转了她的脂肪肝和糖尿病前期-以下是需要知道的-女性健康 | This Woman Reversed Her Fatty Liver And Prediabetes After She Learned About 'Musclespan'—Here's What To Know - Women's Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE4zeDhIck9uOFlNREdxdHlxbHgyNzRDZHUxc0p5eFBGTnNaM3N2YTJfQjVfZDctalZwNFE1S19GVDFEQnV1TG5PZEp3MHRWOTYySC1xOFJMTUU3VThNOFJiVjhaZzR4RGFIM2N6Vk5zUGZKa3h5a2lhSUt5MA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="body-dropcap css-e2yzl9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.0"&gt;Maria Arellano Simpson &lt;/strong&gt;has been on and off restrictive diets since she was 9 years old. “As a young adult growing up in the 2000s, cardio was the focus, and I spent hours doing it to try and get smaller,” says Arellano Simpson, now 44. She logged hours on the stair-stepper and miles on the pavement. It worked, to some degree, providing her a small calorie deficit but no additional muscle or strength. Then, when she had her daughter 12 years ago, she quickly put on 100 pounds, was diagnosed as prediabetic, developed a fatty liver, and registered a body fat percentage in the 50s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fast-forward to last year and her wake-up call, which came in the form of two sick relatives. “I felt like I owed it to my kids to have the best possible health, and I didn’t want them to have to take care of me when I get older,” she says. She began her quest to preserve both her wellness and lifespan. And that, in turn, led her straight to the concept of musclespan—though she didn’t realize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Newly in &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65243267/perimenopause-young-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65243267/perimenopause-young-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="perimenopause" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;, Arellano Simpson was researching how to stay healthy during the transition, so she was aware of the benefits of strength training and muscle in general. Then the social media algorithm started serving her content highlighting muscle and longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;One day, while scrolling TikTok, she came across a strong and athletic trainer from the fitness app &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65172928/peloton-jennifer-jacobs-joining-ladder/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65172928/peloton-jennifer-jacobs-joining-ladder/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ladder" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ladder&lt;/a&gt; who was celebrating muscle and strength. “I remember thinking, &lt;em data-node-id="4.3"&gt;I want to be able to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="4.4"&gt;move and lift like that&lt;/em&gt;,” she recalls. Another post that caught her attention was from a female bodybuilder in her 80s. “She was lifting weights, running, just full of life,” Arellano Simpson says. That’s when “chasing muscle instead of thinness” became her new objective. “All the tools fell into my lap at the right time,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Arellano Simpson, who runs a photography studio in Houston, focusing on muscle shifted her mentality from “I need to lose weight” to “I need to put on as much muscle as possible.” Losing 100 pounds was daunting. Gaining muscle and eating well (and enough)? “A quest worth pursuing,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After nine months of focusing on muscle, she reversed her fatty liver and prediabetes. Her quality of life drastically improved too: She plays with her daughters at the park and climbs flights of stairs with ease, and her chronic back and knee pain are nearly nonexistent. “Muscle gives you freedom,” she says. “I know people need to hear about this.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-musclespan-means" data-node-id="7" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="7.0"&gt;What Musclespan Means&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You’ve probably heard the terms &lt;em data-node-id="8.1"&gt;lifespan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em data-node-id="8.3"&gt;healthspan&lt;/em&gt;. The former signifies how long you live, while the latter refers to how long you’re in good health. “But musclespan is the way in which we support strength and healthy aging,” says physician and &lt;em data-node-id="8.5"&gt;Women’s Health&lt;/em&gt; advisor &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45381895/dr-gabrielle-lyon-forever-strong-book-excerpt/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a45381895/dr-gabrielle-lyon-forever-strong-book-excerpt/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gabrielle Lyon, DO" data-node-id="8.7" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Gabrielle Lyon, DO&lt;/a&gt;, who coined the term and has spent years studying how protein and muscle impact aging, performance, and disease prevention. “It’s about living as long as you can with healthy skeletal muscle.” (Skeletal muscle is the muscle attached to bones, as opposed to cardiac muscle and smooth muscle, located around organs. The more you know!) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As a perioperative medicine physician at Stanford Medicine, &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/k/sarita-khemani.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/k/sarita-khemani.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sarita Khemani, MD" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Sarita Khemani, MD&lt;/a&gt;, often sees patients who are admitted to the hospital after a hip fracture or brain bleed due to a fall that may have been caused, in part, by weak muscles. Having muscle “in reserve” (meaning you built it up earlier in life) that can act as your armor helps you better handle the inevitable injury, surgery, or illness, says Dr. Khemani. That preparation becomes even more important as we age and face unexpected curveballs. “It’s not if, but when, illness strikes, because it happens to all of us,” Dr. Lyon says. “If you are prepared with both strength and mass, then you are much more likely to be able to overcome life’s challenges.” That is musclespan in a nutshell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So, no matter your fitness goals, if you’re interested in extending the healthy and vibrant years ahead, this is an approach that can benefit you. “The data supports that you’re never too old—and also never too young—to improve muscle health,” Dr. Lyon says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="11" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="musclespan" title="musclespan" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/whm060125strengthmusclespan-003-687ea51aa7304.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1gh9ql8 e1geg53v2"&gt;James Macari&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-science-to-back-it" data-node-id="12" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="12.0"&gt;The Science to Back It &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Lyon argues that musclespan not only trumps healthspan but also dictates both healthspan and lifespan. “Muscle is  the key because it is a metabolic and endocrine organ,” she says, citing recent research that links low skeletal muscle mass to an increased risk of all-cause mortality. It’s not just an aesthetic or functional enabler; muscle health is also related to insulin sensitivity, metabolic health, and the ability to withstand illness or injury, Dr. Lyon says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In fact, emerging science around myokines—hormone-like compounds released by contracting skeletal muscle fibers—shows they play a powerful role in regulating inflammation, protecting against chronic disease, and promoting longevity. “Of course, longevity is multifactorial,” Dr. Lyon notes. (Cardiovascular fitness, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64918583/what-is-body-recomp/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="body composition" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;body composition&lt;/a&gt;, and other markers also matter.) “But muscle health, strength, and mass have emerged as some of the most robust predictors of healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While it’s common for people to measure everything from their blood pressure and cholesterol to daily steps, very few measure and track their strength or muscle mass. And muscle isn’t often thought of as an organ in and of itself that deserves as much care as its higher-profile counterparts. “We focus on other organs, like the heart and brain, which are very important. But muscle is a critical organ, especially when it comes to longevity,” adds Dr. Khemani. In short, tracking musclespan the way you do other mainstream health markers is a smart move—and easier than you might think (see “How to Measure Your Musclespan” coming up). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-muscle-tells-you-more" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;Why Muscle Tells You More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;How is it that muscle is so protective? Those myokines may be the reason exercise decreases the risk of chronic disease, including cancer, cardiovascular illness, and neurodegeneration, according to a review in &lt;em data-node-id="18.1"&gt;Endocrine Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. “These powerful messengers allow muscle to ‘talk’ to other organs, including the brain, adipose tissue, liver, and immune system, helping regulate vital processes like blood sugar control, metabolism, mood, and brain health,” Dr. Khemani explains. “Because of this, muscle is deeply connected to metabolic health, cognitive function, longevity, and disease resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If peak musclespan is at one end of the spectrum, sarcopenia—a disease characterized by a decline in muscle mass and function—is at the other. It’s often thought of as a disease of aging, but it actually affects more than 10 percent of adults in their 20s and 30s, per a recent review in &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;All of this is to say: “Maintaining muscle isn’t optional,” Dr. Khemani says. “Healthy muscle is one of the most powerful predictors of how long and how well one will live.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-apply-it-to-life" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;How to Apply It to Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;A well-known truth: “The more active you are, the more you prime your body for muscle,” Dr. Lyon says. This means avoiding sedentary stretches outside of your regularly scheduled exercise programming. “One reason muscle becomes unhealthy is there’s no flux,” she explains. “It’s like a pond that becomes a swamp because nothing is moving.” In an ideal world, you’d get up and move at least every 30 minutes or so, says &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65367168/longevitylist/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65367168/longevitylist/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Heather Milton" data-node-id="22.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Heather Milton&lt;/a&gt;, exercise physiologist supervisor at NYU Langone’s Sports Performance Center.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Activity may prime the body for muscle, but resistance training builds it. “There’s no replacement for resistance training because [it changes the] muscle fibers,” Dr. Lyon says. As you age, this becomes especially important, since fast-twitch muscle fibers—the ones responsible for strength and explosive movement—naturally shrink. “They decrease in size and number, so you see people go from being buff to being skinny and sarcopenic,” she says. “You have to make sure you’re maintaining fast-twitch fibers through strength and power training.” She personally combines strength and power work in one session by integrating moves that require power—like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g25058598/medicine-ball-exercise/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g25058598/medicine-ball-exercise/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="medicine ball slams" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;medicine ball slams&lt;/a&gt;—into her strength workouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="pullquote" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="24" class="embed"&gt;&lt;blockquote data-theme-key="pullquote" class="css-1pxfh3s e1pe3zr91"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote class="css-sh2zho e1pe3zr90"&gt;“Healthy muscle is one of the most powerful predictors of how long and how well one will live.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Strength training twice a week is the recommended minimum, says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19036/deborah-kwolek" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/19036/deborah-kwolek" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Deborah Gomez Kwolek, MD" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Deborah Gomez Kwolek, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the founding lead of the Mass General Women’s Health and Sex and Gender Medicine Program. You can start small, using dumbbells at home, and work your way up to three or four sessions a week. Arellano Simpson is a good case study: She began with 15-minute strength training workouts on the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g21971119/best-workout-apps-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g21971119/best-workout-apps-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ladder app" data-node-id="25.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Ladder app&lt;/a&gt;. Now she does two lower-body workouts and two upper-body workouts through the app every week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;No matter how often you train, you want to target all major muscle groups—chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms, and core—and lift enough weight to put sufficient stress on the muscles so that they have to adapt. “Choose a weight that, by the last repetition, you could probably do only about one or two more times before failure, or before your form breaks,” Milton says. She suggests training primarily in a hypertrophy (or muscle growth) rep range, which is three to six sets of 8 to 12 repetitions of an exercise. Perhaps most important: Continually challenge yourself in new ways through progressive stimulus—increasing the intensity, volume, and/or complexity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And you can’t skip taking a protein-first approach to nutrition. Dr. Lyon recommends that women consume 0.7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of target body weight, but no less than 100 grams per day; the older and more active you are, the more you need. Once protein needs are met, she adds, most metabolically healthy people can then divvy up the rest of their daily calories between carbs and fats as they like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Okay, you may feel as if you have a lot of homework now! But the flip side of &lt;em data-node-id="29.1"&gt;allll&lt;/em&gt; of these tasks is recovery. It’s critical to nail the right work-to-rest ratio so your muscles have enough time to recover, adapt, and become healthier, Milton says. “If you are doing higher-intensity exercise or lifting for the same muscle groups every day, your system doesn’t have a chance to repair that tissue,” she says. Strength training causes microscopic tears to the muscles, which require at least 48 hours to repair and come back stronger. That’s why sleep is imperative: “When we sleep, the hormones that create those adaptations are at their peak,” Milton says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Musclespan isn’t built in a day—but with strategic training, enough protein, and real rest, you can create a body with built-in armor. As Dr. Khemani puts it: If you want to stay active, independent, and mentally sharp, “muscle is necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-measure-your-musclespan" data-node-id="31" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;How to Measure Your Musclespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="32.0"&gt;If you can do more than one of these tests, you’ll paint a holistic picture of your muscle health. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-node-id="33" class="css-1wk73g0 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.0"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0.0"&gt;Train three functional movement patterns. &lt;/strong&gt;“I believe everyone should be able to do a push-up, a pull-up, and a good bodyweight squat,” Dr. Lyon says. &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65371604/push-up-tips/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a65371604/push-up-tips/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Push-ups" data-node-id="33.0.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Push-ups&lt;/a&gt; in particular are a barometer of muscle­span over time, says Milton. She points to a study that found that men who could do 40 push-ups had a lower risk of morbidity and death than those who could do only 10. (Women would likely see similar benefits with fewer reps, though a comparable study hasn’t been done yet, Milton says.) Dr. Lyon recommends performing a self-assessment using these three moves—how many can you do with good form?—aiming for 10 push-ups, 1 &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64702069/how-to-do-a-pull-up-training-plan-pdf/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64702069/how-to-do-a-pull-up-training-plan-pdf/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="unassisted pull-up" data-node-id="33.0.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;unassisted pull-up&lt;/a&gt;, and 25-plus squats as a benchmark. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.1.0"&gt;Test your grip strength. &lt;/strong&gt;In addition to being a “fundamental metric” when it comes to muscle function and overall physical capacity, grip strength was proposed as a “new vital sign of health” in a recent review in the &lt;em data-node-id="33.1.2"&gt;Journal of Health, Population and Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. “Grip strength is an easy test that can be done on most populations without injury risk, and it has strong correlations to overall function and strength,” Milton says. You can find &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64555515/grip-strength-longevity/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64555515/grip-strength-longevity/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="grip strength testers" data-node-id="33.1.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;grip strength testers&lt;/a&gt;—called dynamometers—on Amazon. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.2.0"&gt;Know your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="VO2 max" data-node-id="33.2.0.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.0.1.1"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;This metric tells you how much oxygen you use during exercise. “In the clinical world, we use aerobic capacity to measure your risk for early morbidity and mortality,” says Milton. It’s measured while you’re engaged in cardio, but muscle mass is one of the main components determining your number. “Muscle is the tissue with the mitochondria that utilize oxygen to produce ATP—which is the molecule needed for contraction,” she explains. Ensuring your VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.2"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max falls within a healthy range for your age and gender (look for charts online) can also provide insight into your overall muscle health. You can get a VO&lt;sub data-node-id="33.2.4"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max test at a lab (give it a Google for locations near you) or use a wearable, like an Apple Watch or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40471424/oura-ring-gen-3-review/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40471424/oura-ring-gen-3-review/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Oura Ring" data-node-id="33.2.6" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt;, for a general idea.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.3.0"&gt;Have blood work done. &lt;/strong&gt;Remember how muscle helps regulate metabolism? Well, looking at the blood markers related to metabolic syndrome—like triglycerides, insulin, and glucose—can be a clue to your muscular health. “All of those are indicators of metabolic syndrome, which is [in actuality] unhealthy skeletal muscle,” Dr. Lyon says. She recommends having blood work performed quarterly to check your numbers. While most of the tests can be ordered by a primary care provider during a routine physical, insulin isn’t always included, she notes, so ask for a fasting insulin test specifically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="33.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.4.0"&gt;Consider a scan. &lt;/strong&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65037382/bone-health-trend-dexa/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65037382/bone-health-trend-dexa/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DEXA scan" data-node-id="33.4.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;DEXA scan&lt;/a&gt; is a type of X-ray exam that uses a small amount of radiation to look at your bone density.

                                &lt;p&gt;More than 40% of U.S. adults are considered obese. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doctors and health experts say there are different types of fat. Some are more dangerous than others, so it's important to know what type you're carrying around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subcutaneous fat is the type just beneath the skin that you can pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the more dangerous kind, visceral fat, is buried deep within the abdomen. It's typically stored around your belly and can wrap itself around your organs, trigger inflammation, and contribute to several health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Visceral fat has shown to increase all major chronic diseases," said Julia Zumpano, registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of that deep belly fat can help you be healthier, and experts say being active is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we're sitting at a desk all day and we're only doing 30 minutes of exercise, but we're doing it every day, it's still really not enough for most people," Zumpano explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say work movement into your daily life. Trying a walking desk, taking breaks to go for a walk, doing squats at your desk, wearing a weighted vest, taking the stairs, or parking further away all can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next key? A healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Belly fat can be increased by artificial and sugary foods," said Zumpano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, be sure to steer away from sweets and toward whole foods, like lean sources of protein and fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plant-based diets, Mediterranean diets, have been shown to be very helpful when it comes to reducing inflammation and visceral fat," Zumpano added.&lt;/p&gt;

On the East Bank, which covers more than 330,000 residents, levels are categorized as “medium” but fluctuating.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The East Bank, representing most of New Orleans, was previously in the “high” category on Friday, said Amanda Bidwell, scientific program manager for the netword, a sign that there may be a sustained bump in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we're starting to see a surge happen for COVID, it kind of toggles on and off between medium and high,” Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/coronavirus/louisiana-to-expand-covid-wastewater-test-to-100-sites-starting-with-jazz-fest/article_cf84837a-c595-11ec-88cf-1bf0f9505206.html" target="_blank"&gt;Wastewater offers a near real-time view&lt;/a&gt; of virus activity in the community. People shed viruses like COVID in stool, saliva and other waste when they brush their teeth or flush the toilet, making wastewater a reliable early warning tool before people might have symptoms or seek out care. The WastewaterSCAN data is updated with three samples weekly from each of the two New Orleans treatment plants.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It provides a really good snapshot of what is happening in your community,” Bidwell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At local hospitals, the rise hasn’t translated into a noticeable spike in patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a few patients in the hospital who have COVID, but nothing terribly outrageous,” said Dr. Julio Figueroa, an infectious disease specialist at LSU Health New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 appears to be following a now-familiar pattern: two bumps a year, often after travel-heavy holidays, said Figueroa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other common viruses tracked in the wastewater — including RSV, flu A and B, adenovirus, enterovirus D68, norovirus, and rotavirus — are also currently in the “low” range.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;For residents wondering how to use the data, Bidwell suggests thinking of it like a weather report. While public health agencies haven’t issued any formal alerts, individuals may choose to take extra precautions, like masking or avoiding large indoor gatherings, especially if they are vulnerable or caring for the young or elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="4"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With most viruses quiet for now, clinicians are turning their attention to the months ahead, when viruses are typically more active, said Figueroa, who noted a drop in vaccination rate for pertussis, or whooping cough, which has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/healthcare_hospitals/louisiana-measles-whooping-cough/article_cfdab26a-4e0b-4327-9659-d1c93352c84f.html" target="_blank"&gt;infant deaths in Louisiana this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Here’s something that will make you lose just a bit more faith in humanity—or at least reach for some hand wipes. New research shows that even in hospitals, a substantial number of people aren’t bothering to wash their hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of Surrey in England led the study, installing sensors near hospital toilet and sink pipes to keep track of people’s handwashing. Nearly half of toilet users skipped the sink after flushing, they found. The researchers say more effective strategies are needed to remind and convince people of the importance of handwashing, particularly in high-risk environments like hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have tried to analyze how rigorous people are about handwashing in hospitals and other settings, but they’ve been limited. Some have relied on asking people to self-report their hygiene habits, for instance, which &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136445"&gt;might incentivize&lt;/a&gt; more than a few to fudge the truth. The researchers decided to take a different approach. They connected sensors to toilet and sink pipes that could objectively and non-intrusively detect if and when they were being used. The sensors work by measuring the temperature in the pipes and nearby air; when either cold or hot water passes through the pipes, the temperature sharply changes relative to its surroundings, indicating use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers teamed up with the Bispebjerg Hospital in Denmark to conduct their study (aptly named the “FLUSH. WASH. PROTECT.” study). For 19 weeks, they tracked people’s handwashing behaviors at two public restrooms in the hospital, ultimately recording more than 2,600 flushes. Nearly 44% of the time after flushing, people steered clear of handwashing. At times, non-adherence was even worse, with over 60% of people not handwashing during certain weeks. Non-handwashing was also more common at the start and end of the day and during typical meal times. The team &lt;a href="https://osf.io/befvt"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its findings last week on the Open Source Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“People may assume handwashing is second nature by now—especially in hospitals and post-covid-19—but our data paints a different picture,” said lead author Pablo Pereira-Doel, co-leader of the Human Insight Lab at the University of Surrey’s Business School, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1091556"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low rates of handwashing can, of course, make it easier for doctors, patients, and visitors to inadvertently spread dangerous infections to already vulnerable people, including &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/superbugs-will-kill-nearly-40-million-people-over-the-next-25-years-scientists-warn-2000499745"&gt;drug-resistant superbugs.&lt;/a&gt; Some studies have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6483670/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that certain interventions, like clear signs, can modestly boost handwashing at hospitals, at least temporarily. But given the results here, it’s likely we’ll need to do a lot more to consistently improve people’s hand hygiene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings are worrying but not surprising. Even simple behaviors like handwashing can lapse without reinforcement. In hospitals, lapses like these can have serious consequences—for patients and for the wider healthcare system. It’s time we moved beyond posters and hand gel stations to more effective behavioral strategies,” said study author Carrie Newlands, Lead for Clinical Skills at the University of Surrey’s School of Medicine, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I wouldn’t blame you (or myself) for avoiding the standard handshake more often. And just in case anyone needs it, here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html"&gt;proper technique&lt;/a&gt; for handwashing, courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
