While lifestyle changes, cutting back on salt, and exercise might be the key to keeping blood pressure in check, but some daily nutrients also play a major role in controlling high blood pressure. Certain nutrients have been shown to support healthy blood pressure naturally, and research published in NIH, PubMed Central, all highlight five particular vitamins that are essential for our heart health and overall wellbeing. And these are...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium helps the blood vessels relax, which is great for the heart. and blood flow. Studies published in the National Institute of Health highlight the role of magnesium for hypertension management, and suggest that magnesium intake of 500 mg/gl to 1000 mg/f may reduce blood pressure and as much as 5.6/2.8 mm Hg. Infact, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.125.25129" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Heart Association Journals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;also recommend that magnesium is beneficial in reducing BP among people with hypertension and hypomagnesemia. Magnesium works by helping the body release nitric oxide, which opens up the blood vessels and reduces resistance, making the heart muscles to function better, thereby pumping blood more efficiently&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Natural Ways to Control High Blood Pressure Effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3 Fatty Acids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long chain omega-3 fatty acids, known as EPA and DHA found in fish oil, might be a meaningful way to lower blood pressure. A 2014 study published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24610882/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; follows a randomised trial, which found that EPA+DHA led to an average reduction of about 1.5 mmHg in systolic and 1.0 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure levels across all participants. The reason? EPA and DHA are these healthy fats that helps to reduce inflammation, improve blood vessels and lower vascular resistance. High-quality recommended supplements and fish oil may be a smart part of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potassium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potassium plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy balance of sodium within the human body. It aids in relaxing the walls of blood vessels, which in turn facilitates the excretion of sodium through urine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), an increase in dietary potassium intake is shown to significantly lower blood pressure among adults. Foods rich in this essential element include bananas, spinach, and sweet potatoes, which are notably effective in promoting health. Additionally, a study published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) revealed that an average increase of 4.7 grams (or 120 mmol) of dietary potassium per day is correlated with a notable reduction in blood pressure, with averages of 8.0/4.1 mm Hg recorded, varying according to race and the relative intake of other minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcium consumption, however, exerts a rather modest effect on blood pressure compared to the other nutrients. Consistently, supplementation of calcium has been shown to decrease systolic blood pressure by about 1.4 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by about 1.5 mm Hg.One such meta-analysis is published in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.HYP.31.1.131" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Heart Association Journals,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; it suggests that calcium supplementation has a small effect (−1.7 mm) on systolic blood pressure in hypertensive but not normotensive patients. It is involved in the contraction and relaxation of the wall of the blood vessels, and its proper intake is essential to maintain the blood pressure within its normal range. Recommendation for enough intake of calcium from dairy or plant origin is necessary, especially for those people with low dietary calcium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between vitamin D and blood pressure often sparks controversy, especially when considering the cholecalciferol form of the vitamin. As research continues to develop in this area, some important findings are beginning to surface. A recent meta-analysis featured in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29776759/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;PubMed Central&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; indicates that vitamin D can lead to a modest reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, primarily in individuals who are vitamin D deficient or those living with diabetes. While the results remain mixed and somewhat ambiguous, one conclusion can be drawn: supplementation of vitamin D may provide some beneficial effects for people experiencing high blood pressure, though it is less likely to significantly influence those who already maintain adequate levels of vitamin D and have no underlying metabolic risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2025 02:42:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>常见的甜味剂可能会损坏关键的大脑屏障，危及中风- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/erythritol-sweetener-blood-brain-barrier-study</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Found in everything from protein bars to energy drinks, erythritol has long been considered a safe alternative to sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But research suggests this widely used sweetener may be quietly undermining one of the body's most crucial protective barriers – with potentially serious consequences for heart health and stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00276.2025"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Colorado suggests erythritol may damage cells in the blood-brain barrier, the brain's security system that keeps out harmful substances while letting in nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings add troubling new detail to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;previous observational studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked erythritol consumption to increased rates of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/21-year-study-links-gum-disease-and-cavities-to-higher-stroke-risk"&gt;21-Year Study Links Gum Disease And Cavities to Higher Stroke Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the recent study, researchers exposed blood-brain barrier cells to levels of erythritol typically found after drinking a soft drink sweetened with the compound. They saw a chain reaction of cell damage that could make the brain more vulnerable to blood clots – a leading cause of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol triggered what scientists call oxidative stress, flooding cells with harmful, highly reactive molecules known as free radicals, while simultaneously reducing the body's natural antioxidant defences. This double assault damaged the cells' ability to function properly, and in some cases killed them outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But perhaps more concerning was erythritol's effect on the blood vessels' ability to regulate blood flow. Healthy blood vessels act like traffic controllers, widening when organs need more blood – during exercise, for instance – and tightening when less is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They achieve this delicate balance through two key molecules: nitric oxide, which relaxes blood vessels, and endothelin-1, which constricts them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that erythritol disrupted this critical system, reducing nitric oxide production while ramping up endothelin-1. The result would be blood vessels that remain dangerously constricted, potentially starving the brain of oxygen and nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This imbalance is a known warning sign of &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-016-0211-9"&gt;ischaemic stroke&lt;/a&gt; – the type caused by blood clots blocking vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more alarming, erythritol appeared to sabotage the body's natural defence against blood clots. Normally, when clots form in blood vessels, cells release a "clot buster" called &lt;a href="https://bmjopenrespres.bmj.com/content/6/1/e000440"&gt;tissue plasminogen activator&lt;/a&gt; that dissolves the blockage before it can cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sweetener blocked this protective mechanism, potentially leaving clots free to wreak havoc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laboratory findings align with troubling evidence from human studies. Several large-scale observational studies have found that people who regularly consume erythritol face significantly higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9"&gt;One major study&lt;/a&gt; tracking thousands of participants found that those with the highest blood levels of erythritol were roughly twice as likely to experience a major cardiac event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the research does have limitations. The experiments were conducted on isolated cells in laboratory dishes rather than complete blood vessels, which means the cells may not behave exactly as they would in the human body. Scientists acknowledge that more sophisticated testing – using advanced "blood vessel on a chip" systems that better mimic real physiology – will be needed to confirm these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are particularly significant because erythritol occupies a unique position in the sweetener landscape. Unlike artificial sweeteners such as aspartame or sucralose, erythritol is technically a sugar alcohol – a naturally occurring compound that the body produces in small amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classification helped it avoid inclusion in recent &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/15-05-2023-who-advises-not-to-use-non-sugar-sweeteners-for-weight-control-in-newly-released-guideline"&gt;World Health Organization guidelines&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged the use of artificial sweeteners for weight control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erythritol has also gained popularity among food manufacturers because it behaves more like sugar than other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sucralose is 320 times sweeter than sugar, erythritol provides only about 80% of sugar's sweetness, making it easier to use in recipes without creating an overpowering taste. It's now found in thousands of products, especially in many "sugar-free" and "keto-friendly" foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180493" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Eating-a-protein-bar-close-up-.jpg" alt="Woman eats a chocolate protein bar " class="size-full wp-image-180493" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Eating-a-protein-bar-close-up-.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Eating-a-protein-bar-close-up--600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180493" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Erythritol can be found in many keto-friendly products, such as protein bars. (Valeriia Sviridova/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trade-off&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulatory agencies, including the European Food Standards Agency and the US Food and Drug Administration, have approved erythritol as safe for consumption. But the new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even "natural" sugar alternatives may carry unexpected health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-how-this-artificial-sweetener-may-cause-heart-damage?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Study Reveals How This Artificial Sweetener May Cause Heart Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For consumers, the findings raise difficult questions about the trade-offs involved in sugar substitution. Sweeteners like erythritol can be valuable tools for weight management and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="180489" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; prevention, helping people reduce calories and control blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if regular consumption potentially weakens the brain's protective barriers and increases cardiovascular risk, the benefits may come at a significant cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research underscores a broader challenge in nutritional science: understanding the long-term effects of relatively new food additives that have become ubiquitous in the modern diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While erythritol may help people avoid the immediate harms of excess sugar consumption, its effect on the blood-brain barrier suggests that frequent use could be quietly compromising brain protection over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As scientists continue to investigate these concerning links, consumers may want to reconsider their relationship with this seemingly innocent sweetener – and perhaps question whether any sugar substitute additive is truly without risk.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261500/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — Don’t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can’t prove that melatonin use plays any role — instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,” said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our bodies naturally produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycles. Levels normally increase as it gets darker in the evening, triggering drowsiness. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn’t undergone peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

    &lt;div class="Infobox-items RichTextBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is part of AP’s Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/be-well"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Read more Be Well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It’s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn’t involved in the study. The study also did not show dosages.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Also, U.S. supplements don’t require government approval, meaning brands can vary in their ingredients. The researchers, from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, characterized the findings as a call for more research.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, patients wondering about melatonin should talk it over with their doctors, said Emory’s Sandesara. Generally doctors recommend it for short-term use, like for jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yancy noted that while the study doesn’t prove there’s a danger from long term melatonin use, there’s also no evidence that people should use melatonin indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one key to better shut-eye is to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/sleep-stress-anxiety-caffeine-alcohol-35dfa5725a0fdefae0b18d5442e55cb3"&gt;practice better sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, like making sure your room is dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we expose ourselves to blue light in particular at night, we are diminishing our melatonin levels. That’s science,” he said.

Researchers compared local burials, city life, and population patterns to what real epidemic-hit places look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scale is not small. Four city cemeteries hold roughly 11,350 to 12,950 people, and hundreds of graves were examined in detail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those &lt;a href="https://www.amarnaproject.com/our-work/excavation-and-survey/south-tombs-cemetery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cemeteries&lt;/a&gt; were excavated between 2005 and 2022, giving a close look at how ordinary people were buried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-studying-the-akhetaten-plague"&gt;Studying the Akhetaten plague&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead bioarchaeologist Gretchen R. Dabbs of Southern Illinois University Carbondale (&lt;a href="https://siu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SIU&lt;/a&gt;) co-authored the analysis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project pulls together burial data, settlement evidence, and population modeling from Akhetaten, better known today as Amarna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We conclude that when the evidence is considered as a whole, there is little to currently suggest Akhetaten was affected by a mortal epidemic,” wrote Dabbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team looked for classic crisis signs and did not find them. They saw ordinary burials, careful wrapping, and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/etruscan-tomb-sealed-for-2600-years-reveals-more-than-100-intact-artifacts/"&gt;grave goods&lt;/a&gt; placed with care rather than rushed disposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texts from the wider region mention disease, including the Hittite “plague prayers” and several letters in the Amarna archive. Yet none point to a lethal plague outbreak inside Akhetaten itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new assessment weighs those writings against local ground truth. It keeps the texts in view but checks them against what the city’s archaeology actually shows on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-cemeteries-reveal"&gt;What the cemeteries reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most graves are single pit burials with textile shrouds and mat “coffins.” Bodies were not tossed in at random, and burial positions are typically orderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple burials do appear, especially in one northern cemetery, but who is buried with whom matters. Adult women are often interred with children, a pattern that looks intentional rather than emergency triage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that northern cemetery, a very high share of the dead are between about 5 and 25 years old. That is unusual for a normal town cemetery and suggests a restricted group rather than a cross-section of the whole city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A field photograph shows a triple burial from the North Tombs Cemetery, but context is key. The same area also records signs of heavy labor on the skeletons, pointing to a young workforce under strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-searching-for-akhetaten-plague"&gt;Searching for Akhetaten plague&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study leans on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-egypts-oldest-genome-reveals-surprising-ancestry-mix/"&gt;bioarchaeology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;the study of human remains from archaeological sites, to separate hard evidence from rumor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It checks for changes in how people were buried, and for cemetery clusters that would mark a sudden spike in deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also consider paleopathology&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;the study of disease in ancient bones, which rarely captures fast-moving infections. Many lethal microbes leave little or no trace on skeletons, especially if death follows quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/07130427/Akhetaten-plague_graveyard-excavation_skeleton_UChicago_1m.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/11/07130433/Akhetaten-plague_graveyard-excavation_skeleton_UChicago_1s.webp" alt="An undisturbed burial at the North Tombs Cemetery containing three individuals (Inds. 1167, 1168, and 1169), who were wrapped together in a single burial mat before interment.

Where several people share one grave, the combinations are patterned, often linking women and children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That pairing, repeated across sites, implies caregiving bonds at death. It reads like culture, not chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the cemeteries, people carry linear enamel hypoplasia, grooves in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tooth-enamel-analysis-suggests-early-eurasians-were-multiple-species-paranthropus-robustus/"&gt;tooth enamel&lt;/a&gt; from childhood stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also show spinal trauma and degenerative joint disease, long-term wear in joints from heavy use. These signals point to hard lives. They do not point to a runaway contagion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used paleodemography&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;estimating past population structures from burials, to check how many people should have died in a city this size over about two decades. The expected number and the observed number line up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That match matters. A true mass-mortality year would create a sharp bulge in the count, and the cemeteries do not show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aftermath-of-an-epidemic"&gt;Aftermath of an epidemic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When epidemics really hammer a city, normal systems often crack. Burials get rushed, pits get bigger, buildings stall, and people leave without their things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akhetaten’s traces tell a different story. Burials were methodical, and city life shows remodeling and ongoing activity during the years the city was used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital did not vanish overnight. It shrank as royal policy shifted after the Akhenaten plague, and some people stayed on for years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That slow fade fits the archaeological record. It does not fit the picture of a city collapsing under a sudden fatal wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-closer-look-at-the-northern-cemetery"&gt;Closer look at the northern cemetery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One northern burial ground stands out for youth-heavy deaths and many shared graves. It likely served a workforce rather than the whole city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its skeletons show high workloads. Add stress and poor diet, and you get a dangerous mix without needing a single killer pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hittite prayers and diplomatic letters describe disease in the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bronze-age-people-abandoned-meat-for-millet-3500-years-ago/"&gt;Late Bronze Age&lt;/a&gt; world. They still matter, and they set the regional background. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, local context is king. At Akhetaten, the ground evidence does not confirm a lethal outbreak in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-lessons-from-the-akhetaten-plague"&gt;Lessons from the Akhetaten plague&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeologists track taphonomy&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the changes to remains after death, because disorder caused by decay can mimic careless burial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also think in terms of syndemic&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; linked health problems that worsen each other, which fits the city’s mix of work stress and undernutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those concepts help explain why hard lives can raise mortality without a single catastrophic disease event. They also explain why rumors of plague can linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal deaths cluster in the historical record, and fearsome &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ancient-egyptians-may-have-seen-their-goddess-in-the-milky-way/"&gt;deities of disease&lt;/a&gt; are prominent in art. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those threads are easy to knot into a single tidy tale. Repetition then hardens the guess into “fact.” The new work puts that story back on evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence from graves, bones, and city layers agrees. Akhetaten reads like a stressed but functioning city, not a community cut down by a lethal epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is a reminder to test big stories against local data. It shows how science rewrites old narratives without drama or hype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/736705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Journal of Archaeology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 21:34:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOWjgya1FWNm4wc0NGeEVzR1RqNFRzQWdTWXJJcjZSWlB4UlcxUkdZVHJZS0tWOVZ1S0FVSE5KemtkX3VrZlZUWFZVVXZZY1dHODRjemFnODE0dFFidzFfem9lQk0ybWxxeFhzUjdzbXVnY3Z0ZDdOdnpJWVo0VVcyUHRyZUpUXzdfRS16SXJ2VGd4Sm9kUk1jaXVLdk1SN1gteHpxblpMWV9sVmZG</guid></item><item><title>两种肾功能测试之间的分歧预示着严重的健康问题- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-11-disagreement-kidney-function-health-problems.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mismatch between two common tests for kidney function may indicate a higher risk for kidney failure, heart disease, and death, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Health care providers for decades have measured blood levels of the molecule creatinine to track the rate at which kidneys filter waste from muscle breakdown in the bloodstream. According to more recent guidelines, levels of cystatin C, a small protein made by all cells in the body, can also be used to measure kidney function. Since these two tests are influenced by different factors—including some related to disease or aging—using both markers together can provide a better measure of kidney function and risk of organ failure than either one alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Led by NYU Langone Health researchers, the new work reveals that many people, especially those who are sick, often have a large gap between the two readings, which may be a signal of future disease. Specifically, the global study shows that more than a third of hospitalized participants had a cystatin C-based readout of kidney function that was at least 30% lower than one based on their creatinine levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings highlight the importance of measuring both creatinine and cystatin C to gain a true understanding of how well the kidneys are working, particularly among older and sicker adults," said study co-corresponding author Morgan Grams, MD, Ph.D. "Evaluating both biomarkers may identify far more people with poor kidney function, and earlier in the disease process, by covering the blind spots that go with either test."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is publishing online Nov. 7 in the &lt;i&gt;JAMA&lt;/i&gt; and is simultaneously being presented at the American Society of Nephrology's annual Kidney Week conference.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Beyond detecting signs of disease, assessing patients' kidney function is important for calculating the appropriate dosage for cancer medicines, antibiotics, and many other drugs, says Grams, the Susan and Morris Mark Professor of Medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During another investigation, the results of which were published the same day, the same research team found that a record number of people worldwide have &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+kidney+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;, which is now the ninth leading cause of death globally. Having new ways to spot the condition early can help ensure that patients receive swift treatment and avoid more dramatic interventions such as dialysis and organ transplantation, says Grams, who is also a professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the recent investigation, the research team analyzed health care records, blood tests, and demographic data collected from 860,966 men and women of a half-dozen nationalities. All participants had their creatinine and cystatin C levels measured on the same day and received follow-ups 11 years later on average. The team considered factors unrelated to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney function&lt;/a&gt; that influence the biomarkers' readings, such as smoking, obesity, and history of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performed as part of the international Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium, the study is the largest to date to explore differences between the two tests and whether they may signal potential health problems, the authors say. Established to better understand and treat the condition, the consortium provides evidence for global definitions of chronic kidney disease and related health risks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;According to the new findings, those whose cystatin C-based measures of kidney filtration were at least 30% lower than their creatinine-based measures were at higher risk for death, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and heart failure than those who had a smaller difference between the two metrics. The former group was also more likely to be diagnosed with severe chronic kidney disease that required dialysis or an organ transplant. The same was found for 11% of outpatients and seemingly healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grams notes that while cystatin C testing was first recommended in 2012 by the international organization Kidney Disease—Improving Global Outcomes, a 2019 survey revealed that less than 10% of clinical laboratories in the United States performed it in-house. The two largest laboratories, Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, now offer the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results underscore the need for physicians to take advantage of the fact that more hospitals and health care providers are starting to offer cystatin C testing," said study co-corresponding author Josef Coresh, MD, Ph.D., director of NYU Langone's Optimal Aging Institute. "Physicians might otherwise miss out on valuable information about their patients' well-being and future medical concerns."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coresh, who is also the Terry and Mel Karmazin Professor of Population Health at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, cautions that among the hospitalized Americans in the study, less than 1% were tested for cystatin C.&lt;/p&gt;

What does this mean for schools and households as we head into peak respiratory virus season, with relatives of all ages hugging and spreading those germs around? There must be something we can do now to help prevent illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Sharing toys are among the habits children have that make it easier for viruses to spread. - Manu Vega/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help answer these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner. She also has two kids in elementary school, so she’s dealt with her share of germs outside of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What did the study find about how we spread viruses? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This study is one of the most detailed analyses of how respiratory viruses circulate in schools. Researchers followed more than 800 students and staff members from a large public school district in Kansas City, Missouri, from November 2022 through May 2023. Participants were asked to collect weekly nasal swabs and to complete short surveys about any symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough, sore throat, congestion or fever. The goal was to track both the presence of viruses and the frequency of symptomatic illness over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that respiratory viruses and the illnesses they cause were very common. More than 85% of all participants had at least one virus detected during the study, and over 80% experienced at least one episode of acute respiratory illness. That means their symptoms were significant enough to interfere with normal activities, keeping them home, rather than just dealing with a mild runny nose or a brief cough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Younger children in prekindergarten and elementary school had the highest rates of both infection and illness on average. By contrast, older students and staff tested positive and fell ill less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many children tested positive even when they felt well, which suggests that schools may serve as a steady reservoir of respiratory viruses, with young students acting as carriers in school to infect one another and taking those viruses home to their household members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What kinds of viruses were most common in the study? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, were detected most often and were found in 65% of participants at some point during the school year. Coronaviruses that often cause seasonal colds were found in about 30%. The virus that causes Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, was found in about 15%. This led researchers to emphasize that even when Covid-19 or flu receive more attention, these “everyday” respiratory viruses remain widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also learned infections occurred even outside of the timelines of major outbreaks, meaning that virus circulation in schools can be steady throughout the season, not just during surges of flu and Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are younger children more likely to catch and spread viruses?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Young children’s immune systems are still developing, and many haven’t yet encountered the wide range of respiratory viruses that circulate each fall and winter. That means their immune defenses are less experienced, making them more likely to get sick when exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children also have habits that make it easier for viruses to spread: They touch their faces often, they share toys and supplies, and they may not cover coughs or wash hands as consistently as older kids and adults. In classrooms and child care settings, they are in close quarters with other children for hours at a time. And because some viruses can spread even when a child has only mild symptoms or none, they can pass infections to others without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Handwashing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is a simple way to reduce the risk of infection. - Guido Mieth/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What do these findings mean for families?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen&lt;/strong&gt;: Kids may have as many as &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stanfordchildrens.org%2Fen%2Ftopic%2Fdefault%253Fid%253Dcommon-cold-in-children-90-P02966&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7C55484842bbad47b3f63b08de1c11f8c4%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638979060698018953%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=5kvqkQWFY4uzLlLzbPrF%2BM%2FRfXYxBpkfSSjNeiKL3fI%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eight colds a year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eight colds a year&lt;/a&gt;, and it may often feel as if the family is just getting over one round of illness when the next one strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most healthy children, respiratory virus infections are mild, but illness can still cause considerable disruption, like missed school days, missed work for parents and strained family routines. Recognizing that pattern can help parents anticipate and take practical steps early, such as helping kids improve hygiene habits and planning for backup child care before illness strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can parents do to reduce the risk of infection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; The most effective approach is simple but consistent prevention.

If soap and water aren’t available, an alcohol-based hand sanitizer is the next best option, though these are not effective against all viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children should be taught to cover coughs and sneezes with their elbow or a tissue, and to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth. Families should also clean and disinfect commonly touched items and surfaces such as toys, doorknobs, light switches and countertops daily, particularly when someone in the household is sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding close contact, such as kissing or sharing drinks, with anyone who has respiratory symptoms also can limit spread. And staying home from school or work when sick remains one of the most effective ways to stop viruses from moving through communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Kids should be taught to cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or their elbow. - Natalia Lebedinskaia/Moment RF/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNN: Do ventilation and masks help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Opening windows when weather allows; using portable air purifiers with high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filters; and running HVAC systems with high-quality filters can help reduce the concentration of airborne viruses indoors.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in January, UnitedHealthcare will no longer pay physicians to remotely monitor the data that patients collect at home about chronic conditions like hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The updated medical &lt;a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/policies/index/mamp/remote-physiologic-monitoring-mamp-01012026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt; for both Medicare and commercial health plans from the country’s largest insurer were posted in September and apply to most of the remote physiologic monitoring (RPM) of patient conditions using devices like blood pressure cuffs and scales. The policy states that RPM “is not reasonable and necessary due to insufficient evidence of efficacy” for a wide swath of conditions including high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, diabetes, and more. By exception, UnitedHealthcare said it will pay physicians to monitor heart failure as well as hypertensive disorders during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UnitedHealthcare’s decision to scale back coverage of remote monitoring services will affect millions of its members and comes after the insurer faced intense criticism for &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/denied-by-ai-unitedhealth-investigative-series/"&gt;allegedly denying to pay for medically necessary care&lt;/a&gt; for its Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. UnitedHealth Group, the insurer’s parent company, is also in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/07/29/unitedhealth-insurance-profit-stephen-hemsley-health-care/"&gt;a financial turnaround&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — Several lots of a prescription ADHD medication have been recalled due to some failed lab tests, &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Product=216857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;according to FDA Enforcement Reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nationwide recall covers several batches of the commonly used medication Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate, a generic version of the ADHD medication Vyvanse. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recall was issued on Oct. 28, and the FDA classified it as a Class II recall on Oct. 30, meaning use "may cause temporary health consequences, but the probability of a serious health issue is remote." &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These recalls are generally conducted at the retail level, and patients and consumers can continue using the medicine unless otherwise directed by the recalling company or FDA," according to the classification description. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

It’s continuous physical activity that increases your heart rate and breathing rate so your heart and blood vessels can work more efficiently. “Regular aerobic activity helps mitigate risks like cardiovascular disease, &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a38595773/what-is-insulin-resistance-syndrome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:insulin resistance;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and bone density loss by improving heart health, managing body composition, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and reducing systemic inflammation,” &lt;a href="https://kovacsinstitute.com/drmarkkovacs.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a human performance scientist and longevity expert, previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kovacsinstitute.com/drmarkkovacs.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Kovacs, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a human performance scientist and longevity expert; and &lt;a href="https://drbrookebussard.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brooke Bussard, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brooke Bussard, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a certified personal trainer and owner of Brooke’s Balanced Blueprint, a lifestyle medicine health coaching practice in Baltimore, MD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The numbers speak for themselves. According to a 2023 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37036905/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Circulation, adults at 50 with ideal cardiovascular health are expected to live an additional 36.2 years, on average, while adults with poor cardiovascular health were only expected to live an additional 27.3 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for how much heart-pumping exercise to get, the CDC &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2712935" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week. But “this is a minimum recommendation,” Kovacs said: People who worked out two to four times above the moderate physical activity recommendations (about 300 to 599 minutes each week) saw the most benefit in a 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.058162" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in Circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, something is better than doing nothing. “The best plan is the one you can stick with,” says &lt;a href="https://drbrookebussard.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brooke Bussard, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brooke Bussard, M.D.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a doctor, certified personal trainer, and owner of Brooke’s Balanced Blueprint, a lifestyle medicine health coaching practice in Baltimore, MD., who recommends walking for about 30 minutes five times a week. If three 10-minute dance breaks a day works better for you, that works too. The bottom line is movement adds up; workouts of less than 10 minutes still count toward recommended weekly activity goals, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When starting a new fitness routine, make sure to check with your doctor, especially if you have high blood pressure or any heart problems, and always be sure to listen to how your body feels when exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:42:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9zVTV4eWZOOTh2em5ucmdKaGNQYXc5VFJIMDBDdVdVbVJxakhKeHhvMmFLWkhpMWhSX2pGaF8tcEt0Q0NjbjlWZXJxV20yb2sxMnVUcVo1XzJyTDRGT1pzeF81RDVQREt4amx1Rl90dHV4d2J6X2RJYmVTUQ</guid></item><item><title>白发保护我们免受癌症的侵害？ - StudyFinds</title><link>https://studyfinds.org/gray-hair-protects-from-cancer/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Every single silver strand of hair represents the successful elimination of DNA-damaged cells. (Credit: Halfpoint on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In A Nutshell&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gray hair in mice signals successful cancer defense&lt;/strong&gt;: When stem cells that produce hair pigment get DNA damage, the body forces them to mature and exit, leaving gray hair behind as evidence that potentially dangerous cells were eliminated.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carcinogens hijack the system&lt;/strong&gt;: Cancer-causing chemicals like UV radiation override this protective response by flooding stem cells with survival signals, allowing damaged cells to persist and potentially form melanoma instead of causing gray hair.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your hair follicle niche makes life-or-death decisions&lt;/strong&gt;: Surrounding support cells produce a protein called KIT ligand that determines whether damaged stem cells get eliminated (causing gray hair) or allowed to survive and multiply (risking cancer).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mouse findings show support in human tissue&lt;/strong&gt;: While the protective mechanism was demonstrated in mice, researchers found elevated KIT ligand in several human melanoma samples, suggesting similar processes may occur in people, though more research is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those silver strands sprouting on your head might be doing more than announcing your age. Research from the University of Tokyo shows that gray hair in mice reflects a built-in cleanup program in which the body hunts down and eliminates damaged cells capable of becoming cancer. Importantly, there are supporting signs this same mechanism is present in human skin tissue samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists tracked what happens to the stem cells responsible for hair color when they get damaged. This led to a surprising discovery in mice. Their bodies force these damaged cells to mature and then kick them out, leaving behind gray hair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a biological trade-off that may be happening in humans too. In other words, accept some &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/no-gray-hairs-preserve-hair-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gray hairs&lt;/a&gt;, or allow damaged cells to persist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gray-hair-101-how-follicles-clear-cells-tied-to-skin-cancer"&gt;Gray Hair 101: How Follicles Clear Cells Tied To Skin Cancer&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stem cells in your hair follicles act as tiny factories that produce pigment. When everything works correctly, these cells wake up during each hair growth cycle, make copies of themselves, and send some of their offspring down the hair shaft to add color. Then they go back to sleep until the next cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what happens when radiation, sun damage, or other environmental stressors break the DNA in these &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/male-infertility-stem-cells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stem cells?&lt;/a&gt; Researchers Yasuaki Mohri and Emi K. Nishimura discovered something unexpected. The damaged cells don’t just die quietly. Instead, they get forced into an unusual double state: they stop dividing forever (that’s the safety brake) while simultaneously maturing into regular pigment cells (that’s the exit strategy).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cells essentially get a one-way ticket out of the follicle. They complete one last job making pigment, then leave the protected stem cell area and get cleared away naturally. The hair follicle loses its color-making factory, and you get a gray hair. Each silver strand represents a successful elimination of cells carrying &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/dna-damage-not-main-culprit-in-sunburns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DNA damage.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41556-025-01769-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, confirmed this in mice by studying animals lacking p53, a protein that acts as the body’s chief DNA damage detector. These mice kept their dark fur even after radiation exposure that would normally cause graying. Sounds great, right? Not exactly. Those damaged cells stayed put, raising the risk that they could eventually transform into cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-carcinogens-hijack-the-system"&gt;When Carcinogens Hijack the System&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the researchers exposed mice to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/do-hot-drinks-really-give-you-cancer-gut-expert-explains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer-causing&lt;/a&gt; chemicals like DMBA (a lab carcinogen used in skin-cancer models) or strong UV radiation, those substances didn’t trigger gray hair at all. Even when the cells had the same DNA breaks that radiation causes, the carcinogens somehow convinced them to keep dividing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trick involves a protein called KIT ligand, or KITL. Normally, cells surrounding the stem cells produce small amounts of KITL to support the stem cell population. But carcinogens cranked up KITL production dramatically, essentially shouting “keep growing!” to cells that should be getting eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the carcinogens turned on arachidonic acid pathways inside the damaged stem cells. When researchers gave mice a prostaglandin E2-like signal (a product of this pathway), it reproduced the effect, blocking the graying response. It’s a two-pronged attack: external survival signals from the environment combined with internal changes that favor growth over elimination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mice treated with just a carcinogen didn’t go gray—their damaged stem cells survived and spread into the surrounding skin, forming the pigmented spots that can progress to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/melanoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;melanoma&lt;/a&gt;. When researchers gave mice both radiation and a carcinogen together, the carcinogen won, blocking the protective gray hair response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-skin-stem-cell-niche"&gt;The Skin Stem Cell Niche&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether KITL really controls this life-or-death decision, the team created mice with reduced KITL in the cells surrounding stem cells. These mice went gray faster, even without any radiation exposure. Their stem cells couldn’t maintain themselves without enough KITL support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More tellingly, when these low-KITL mice received both radiation and carcinogens, the carcinogens couldn’t override the protective response anymore. The mice still went gray because their environment lacked enough KITL to keep damaged stem cells alive. The experiment proved that the surrounding niche makes the critical decision about whether damaged stem cells get eliminated or allowed to persist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers also examined human melanoma samples, specifically the type caused by cumulative sun exposure over many years. In several samples, KITL was elevated not just around&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/hair-follicle-transplants-wounds-scars/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; hair follicles&lt;/a&gt; but throughout the skin surrounding tumors. The cancer had essentially expanded its own support system, creating an environment where damaged cells could thrive and spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-mystery-of-recovering-gray-hair"&gt;The Mystery of Recovering Gray Hair&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rare case reports describe a puzzling phenomenon. Patients whose gray hair appears to “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/frankenstein-could-an-assembled-body-ever-breathe-bleed-or-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;come back to life&lt;/a&gt;” and regain color in certain scalp areas, only to receive a melanoma diagnosis in those exact spots months later. This research offers a possible explanation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The gray hair wasn’t actually recovering. Instead, early melanoma cells spreading through the epidermis were producing their own KITL and other growth factors, supporting any remaining stem cells and their pigment-producing offspring. The darkening hair was actually a warning sign that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; precursor cells were colonizing that area of scalp.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This reframes what looks like rejuvenation as an early danger signal—a cancerous field spreading beneath the skin surface, creating conditions that support cell growth rather than elimination.&lt;/p&gt;

(Photo by Pixel-Shot on Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-skin-and-gray-hair-signals-that-shift-skin-cancer-defenses"&gt;Aging Skin and Gray Hair: Signals That Shift Skin Cancer Defenses&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the team compared young and old mice, they found that aging naturally reduces KITL and other growth factors produced by the stem cell niche. In older mice, these support signals fall and graying speeds up. Aged skin simply doesn’t support stem cell maintenance as well as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/baby-carrots-beautiful-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;young skin&lt;/a&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But this decline might not be entirely bad. By reducing the signals that promote stem cell survival and growth in mice, aging skin may be tilting the balance toward elimination rather than preservation of cells that have accumulated DNA damage over time. It’s a biological guardrail that becomes more conservative with age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Single-cell analysis of over 60,000 skin cells from young and old mice revealed that the proportion of both stem cells and melanocyte clusters dropped significantly in aged animals. The stem cell niche itself shrinks with age in mice, not just the stem cells it supports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-when-skin-cancer-mutations-take-control"&gt;When Skin Cancer Mutations Take Control&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test whether cancer-driving mutations could bypass the protective response like carcinogens do, researchers created mice carrying activated versions of NRAS or BRAF — two of the most common genetic changes in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/skin-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;human melanoma&lt;/a&gt; — specifically in their hair color stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These mutant mice kept their dark fur even after doses of radiation that would normally eliminate all stem cells and cause complete graying. The mutations made cells independent of external KITL signals, allowing them to survive and multiply despite DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team then flipped the question. Could eliminating stem cells through the protective response prevent melanoma? They irradiated cancer-prone mice before triggering the melanoma mutations. Melanoma development dropped dramatically compared to non-irradiated controls. By depleting the stem cell population first, there were simply fewer cells available to transform into cancer when the mutations hit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-real-people"&gt;What This Means for Real People&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings don’t suggest that radiation &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/stop-cancer-cells-invisible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prevents cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Kt clearly doesn’t, and the doses used in research mice don’t match human exposures. But the research does reveal something important about visible aging: those gray hairs represent successful quality control, not just breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People who gray early or extensively, especially in sun-exposed areas like the temples and crown, may have particularly active protective mechanisms. Each gray hair is a follicle where the body identified damage and chose elimination over risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether anti-aging treatments aimed at preventing or reversing gray hair could affect melanoma risk remains an open question for future studies. If such treatments work by keeping damaged stem cells alive and functional longer, it’s unclear what that might mean for cancer development in people with significant sun exposure or other DNA damage sources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team calls the protective process “seno-differentiation,” combining cellular aging’s permanent growth arrest with the maturation and migration that clears damaged cells from stem cell homes. It’s natural quality control that doesn’t require drugs or interventions, just the body’s built-in wisdom about when to eliminate rather than repair.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paradox is clear. Fewer stem cells (and more gray hair) can protect against cancer by limiting the pool of cells available for transformation. Visible &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/growing-old-life-gets-better-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; in this case reflects invisible protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-bigger-picture"&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, should we rethink the relationship between aging and cancer? They’re often portrayed as related processes driven by accumulated DNA damage, but this work shows the body’s response to damage matters more than the damage itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stem cells studied here face a fundamental choice when they acquire DNA breaks. Either undergo the protective elimination program that causes gray hair, or bypass it through carcinogen exposure or cancer mutations and risk melanoma. Individual cells make this decision based on signals from their surrounding environment, but the cumulative effects of millions of these decisions determine whether a person develops gray hair or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The surrounding niche acts as the critical decision-maker, integrating information about growth factor levels, damage signals, and metabolic status to instruct each stem cell about its fate. When carcinogens reprogram the niche to produce high KITL levels, they’re essentially rigging the decision &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/mammograms-after-80-longer-breast-cancer-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in favor of survival&lt;/a&gt; over elimination.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding this antagonism between gray hair and melanoma at the single-cell level opens new ways of thinking about cancer prevention that don’t focus on eliminating all damaged cells but rather on ensuring the right cells get eliminated at the right time through natural pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team used genetically modified mice that express fluorescent markers in melanocyte stem cells, allowing them to track individual cells through microscopy over weeks and months. They synchronized hair growth cycles through depilation and exposed mice to three types of stress at specific times: X-ray radiation (4-5 Gy), topical carcinogen application (DMBA, 100 μg weekly), or UVB radiation (20-200 mJ/cm² three times weekly). Additional mice had specific genes deleted only in stem cells or in the surrounding support cells to test which molecular pathways were required for gray hair versus melanoma development.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team isolated pure populations of stem cells and surrounding niche cells using flow cytometry and analyzed their gene activity through RNA sequencing. They also examined over 60,000 individual skin cells from young and old mice to understand aging effects. Human melanoma samples from 15 patients were analyzed for KITL expression patterns and compared to normal skin from 3 control subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stem cells exposed to radiation entered a state where they stopped dividing permanently while simultaneously maturing into pigment cells—a process the researchers termed “seno-differentiation.” These cells migrated out of their protective niche and were naturally cleared away, depleting the stem cell reserve and causing gray hair. This protective elimination depended on the p53 protein, and mice lacking p53 in stem cells kept their dark fur after radiation but retained damaged cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carcinogens like DMBA and UVB radiation prevented gray hair by dramatically increasing KITL production in surrounding niche cells while activating protective fat metabolism inside damaged stem cells. This combination allowed damaged stem cells to survive and spread into the skin rather than being eliminated. When mice were given both radiation and carcinogens together, the carcinogen blocked the protective response and prevented graying. Prostaglandin E2 treatment mimicked this effect, confirming that fat metabolism products help damaged cells evade elimination. Mice engineered to produce less KITL in their niche went gray faster and couldn’t be rescued by carcinogens, proving the niche makes the critical survival-versus-elimination decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gene activity analysis revealed that radiation turned on p53 damage response pathways and immune signaling related to detecting broken DNA, while carcinogens activated drug metabolism and fat processing pathways instead. Aged mice showed reduced KITL and other growth factor production in their niches, contributing to faster stem cell loss and graying. Mice carrying common melanoma mutations (activated NRAS or BRAF) maintained their stem cells despite radiation, and depleting stem cells through radiation before inducing these mutations significantly reduced melanoma development. Human melanoma samples showed elevated KITL in 8 of 15 cases, particularly in skin surrounding tumors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study used mice rather than humans, and while melanocyte stem cell biology is similar between species, important differences exist in how melanocytes are distributed (mostly in hair follicles in mice versus throughout skin in humans) and how UV radiation affects them. The radiation doses and carcinogen exposures were higher than typical environmental or medical exposures to create clear effects within experimental timeframes, so the findings may not perfectly predict responses to chronic low-level exposures humans experience.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research examined relatively short timeframes of weeks to months, while human melanoma typically develops over decades. The human melanoma analysis included only 15 cases of one subtype (sun-damage-associated lentigo maligna), so whether other melanoma types show similar KITL patterns remains unclear. The study also didn’t address how genetic variations in DNA repair, KITL production, or other pathways might affect the relationship between hair graying and melanoma risk in human populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In a typical year, several thousand samples from flu patients around the world arrive at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They're crucial for understanding the virus's evolution and help form the bedrock of the World Health Organization's effort to design the next annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this year, the flow of that data has come "pretty much to a grinding halt," says Demetre Daskalakis, who led the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at CDC until he &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5522036/cdc-rfk-hhs-monarez-jim-oneill-leadership" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;resigned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From February through July, he says CDC received only 427 samples, 60% fewer than the same time period last year. Only 12 countries had sent CDC samples by then, down 65% compared with 2024. CDC did not respond to NPR's request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When those viruses are not coming in, we don't know what to put in the vaccine, and you're going to have less effective vaccines," says Daniel Jernigan, former director of the CDC's National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic infectious diseases in Atlanta, who also resigned in August.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A possibly patchier picture&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Seven labs around the globe — CDC included — form a network of "WHO collaborating centers" that together make sense of all the virus samples sent in from National Influenza Centers in over 150 countries. But shipments to that whole network are also down so far this year, says Maria Van Kerkhove, interim director of the department of epidemic and pandemic threat management at WHO.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO typically foots the bill for the shipment of many of these samples around the globe. But on January 20, President Trump pulled out of the organization, accusing it of being "owned and controlled by China." The move blew a roughly billion-dollar hole in the organization's budget, and the fund to pay for shipments shrank. WHO is working to find other funding for the shipments, says Van Kerkhove. "We are committed to ensure that our ability to monitor and assess [flu] is not dependent on one member state."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But if this trend continues, scientists could have a patchier picture of influenza's evolution, says Kanta Subbarao, a flu researcher at Laval University who used to run one of those collaborating centers in Melbourne, Australia. "A reduction in the ability of national influenza centers to share samples will be a huge blow to influenza surveillance."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less data could mean a less effective flu shot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In February and September each year, scientists from these WHO collaborating centers meet to decide what influenza strains next year's flu shot should target for the northern and southern hemisphere flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Because we can't predict exactly which virus will dominate in the next season, the vaccine contains multiple strains to try to protect the population against what will come," says Subbarao.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Picking those strains is a bit of a gamble, but one made less risky by the work of more sophisticated labs, like CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we do is work up those viruses. We sequence them. We do tests in ferrets," says Daskalakis. "We do all this stuff to be able to sort of say this virus has a higher pandemic potential, this is a virus that is going to totally circulate next season for flu."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fewer samples will make those analyses harder, says Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. "It reduces the amount of data that the decision can be made on."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;WHO officials declined to share precisely how much less data is getting shared with collaborating centers. And there's still time before February's meeting for countries to send in more samples. But Daskalakis worries that the slowdown at CDC could be harder to reverse, as countries may be wary of sharing data with the U.S. after its withdrawal from WHO.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic preparedness slipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If CDC becomes increasingly out of the loop, Daskalakis says it'll make the U.S. less prepared for a possible flu pandemic. In addition to getting thousands of influenza virus samples from around the world, CDC typically receives about a dozen "candidate vaccine viruses" from the WHO network that serve as the raw material for mass producing flu vaccines in eggs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"By the time I left CDC at the end of August, we had received two, not a dozen," says Daskalakis, which could make it harder to scale up a response to a potential pandemic flu outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;CDC's view of other dangerous pathogens, from COVID-19 to polio, is becoming dimmer too, Daskalakis says. That makes it harder for the agency to find concerning variants of any virus that might spark the next big outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The system is designed to be able to find needles in the haystack if it gets fed enough, if it gets enough data," says Daskalakis. "If it doesn't get fed enough, it's going to take longer to find the needle in the haystack."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And as Daskalakis learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, that time can cost lives.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Every day that we delayed, every day we had less coordination, was a day that tens, hundreds, thousands of people were going to die," he says.

"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health/stop-smoking" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:smoking status;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;smoking status&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?" he said. "And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at things like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/respiratory-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cardiorespiratory fitness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cardiorespiratory fitness&lt;/a&gt;, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure," the doctor said.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia also is a proponent of full-body MRI scans, which can &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:detect cancers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;detect cancers&lt;/a&gt; and other conditions earlier for better outcomes, although he warns of the potential for false positives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/nutrition" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Boosting protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Boosting protein&lt;/a&gt; intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be 55 grams for a 150-pound person or 73 grams for a 200-pound person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional and mental health are just as important as physical health, according to Attia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s as much a practice as what I put into exercise, blood work and cancer screening," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline," Attia went on. "But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline," Attia said.

"I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/relationships" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:great relationships;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;great relationships&lt;/a&gt; to living a longer life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/lifestyle/quizzes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Test Yourself With Our Latest Lifestyle Quiz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaughan echoed that the common denominator in "super agers" involves a supportive community, a healthy social environment and regular contact with people who care for one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Attia (not pictured) said he logs about 10 hours per week of exercise — a mix of fat-burning cardio, high-intensity intervals (to boost VO₂ max), and strength training to maintain muscle.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While decline is inevitable, Attia said his goal is to make what he calls the "marginal decade" as enjoyable as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The marginal decade's not going anywhere.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Green tea isn’t the only antioxidant powerhouse. While green tea is well-known for its catechins and flavonoids, several other teas—including black and matcha—offer equal or even higher antioxidant levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Matcha leads the pack for antioxidant content. Because it uses the whole powdered tea leaf, matcha can contain up to &lt;em&gt;945 mg&lt;/em&gt; of antioxidants per cup—far surpassing traditionally brewed teas and offering strong anti-inflammatory and heart-protective benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each tea offers unique health perks. From black tea’s heart and gut support to white tea’s skin-protective effects and rooibos’s caffeine-free calm, these teas deliver diverse antioxidants that benefit everything from cardiovascular and cognitive health to inflammation and digestion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-with-more-antioxidants-than-blueberries-11773725" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most talked-about nutrients these days, as they can positively impact several aspects of overall health. This is primarily thanks to their ability to target unwanted compounds in the body—namely free radicals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Free radicals can damage cells and cause oxidative stress, while antioxidants neutralize them,” explains Jamie Baham, MS, RDN, LD, registered dietitian and owner of Ladybug Nutrition. Free radicals&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and oxidative stress are often at the root of many of the most common acute and chronic illnesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When looking to boost &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/fruits-with-more-antioxidants-than-green-tea-11739371" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;antioxidant consumption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/green-tea-vs-black-tea-11822262" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;green tea&lt;/a&gt; is a popular option as an accessible, tasty, and rich source of these nutrients. “Outside of it being delicious, green tea is full of antioxidant powerhouses called catechins&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (especially epigallocatechin gallate, or EGCG)—a type of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/flavonoid-rich-foods-8787107" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;flavonoid&lt;/a&gt;. These mighty &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/anti-inflammatory-lifestyle-habits-11769931" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;inflammation fighters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; may protect your cells from damage and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses like heart disease and cancer,” Baham adds. You’ll also find other flavonoids&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; like quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, and rutin in green tea.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These compounds are shown to support cognitive function in older adults&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; as well as promote heart health by lowering LDL cholesterol&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” shares Amy Woodman, RD, dietitian and owner of Farmington Valley Nutrition and Wellness in Simsbury, CT. Better blood sugar management&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-healthier-skin-11784271" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;skin health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/blue-zone-longevity-tips-11832359" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are also tied to the antioxidants in green tea. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on how it’s grown, picked, processed, and brewed, green tea can contain anywhere from 50 and 100 milligrams (mg) of antioxidants per cup&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. However, it’s not the only tea that offers these beneficial nutrients. Read on to discover five teas that contain as much—or more—antioxidants per cup compared to green tea.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As one of the most popular teas stateside, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/black-tea-health-benefits-11752102" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;black tea&lt;/a&gt; is not only delicious, versatile, and nostalgic, but also full of antioxidants. In turn, this tea is associated with plenty of health benefits. “Regular consumption of black tea may offer cardioprotective benefits&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and help lower blood pressure,” shares Woodman. Its high antioxidant content also helps keep our &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;immune health&lt;/a&gt; in tip-top shape&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and may support a healthy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-11833113" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which bodes well for digestive health.

In fact, you’re likely to find it at most coffee shops nowadays. Not only is it incredibly tasty, but this powdered green tea also surpasses regularly brewed green tea in antioxidant content. “Matcha contains a higher concentration of antioxidants because, unlike traditional teas that are steeped and then discarded, matcha is made by whisking the powdered tea leaf directly into water, allowing for the entire leaf to be consumed,” explains Woodman. This results in some very notable health benefits. “Matcha is a powerhouse of antioxidants and can help lower inflammation&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, support healthy cholesterol, and even give you a little &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/habits-that-improve-focus-11797344" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;focus boost&lt;/a&gt;,” shares Villavir. Aside from making for social media-worthy lattes and lemonades, matcha can also be added to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-fruit-smoothie-recipes-7375286" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;smoothies&lt;/a&gt; and baked goods for an antioxidant boost.

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, a simple kitchen ritual has gained quiet traction across homes and wellness circles: &lt;strong&gt;boiling orange peels with cinnamon&lt;/strong&gt;. Advocates praise the blend for its warming aroma and nostalgic comfort—but underneath the scent lies a more provocative question. Is this domestic tradition just olfactory charm, or does it mark the return of overlooked biochemical intelligence?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Emerging scientific reviews and clinical research suggest the answer may be far from trivial. As interest grows in &lt;strong&gt;natural antimicrobial agents&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;air purifiers&lt;/strong&gt;, attention is shifting to the overlooked properties of food waste and spice rack staples. What was once dismissed as kitchen folklore is now under peer-reviewed scrutiny—and the findings are drawing serious attention from biochemists, neurologists, and public health researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The growing convergence between anecdotal practice and empirical validation has put &lt;strong&gt;orange peels and cinnamon&lt;/strong&gt; at the center of a broader discussion: Can common household ingredients serve as functional health tools without crossing into pseudoscience? And if so, how far can their use extend beyond scent into measurable health impacts?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Pot on the Stove or a Low-Tech Purification System?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The core of the practice is straightforward: simmering two or three &lt;strong&gt;orange peels&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;cinnamon sticks&lt;/strong&gt; in water for &lt;strong&gt;10–15 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. The resulting vapor releases a sweet, tangy scent often described as “cleaner than synthetic air fresheners” and “distinctly uplifting.” But it also disperses active compounds into the air—compounds with known &lt;strong&gt;antibacterial and antifungal properties&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2023 peer-reviewed review in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Food Chemistry &amp;amp; Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://foodchemistryjournal.com/2023/11/15/antioxidant-properties-of-orange-peel-and-their-implications-for-health-a-comprehensive-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;orange peels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, long treated as waste, contain &lt;strong&gt;high levels of flavonoids&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;phenolic acids&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;carotenoids&lt;/strong&gt;—molecules shown to reduce oxidative damage at the cellular level. These compounds are especially concentrated in the citrus &lt;strong&gt;albedo&lt;/strong&gt; (white inner peel), which is often discarded in food preparation but becomes bioactive when heated and aerosolized.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the cinnamon side, evidence is equally compelling. A landmark review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20924865/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that &lt;strong&gt;Cinnamomum zeylanicum&lt;/strong&gt;, known as &lt;strong&gt;Ceylon cinnamon&lt;/strong&gt;, demonstrates potent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/04/longevity-to-live-117-years-eating-only-three-yogurts-a-day-research-confirms/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="86084" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antimicrobial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo. While most findings stem from laboratory settings, the molecular activity—especially against airborne bacteria—raises questions about cinnamon’s role in&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/living-near-an-airport-doing-to-your-heart/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75802" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;indoor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/living-near-an-airport-doing-to-your-heart/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="75802" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; air quality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Crucially, both ingredients have documented activity against pathogens that thrive in humid or poorly ventilated spaces, such as &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, and various molds. Experts emphasize this isn’t equivalent to sterilization, but it does represent a measurable contribution to air purification—one supported by evolving &lt;strong&gt;bioactive research&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-quote"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#icon-quote"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s remarkable is how much therapeutic potential is hiding in food by-products like citrus peels,” said Dr. Y. Guo, a co-author of a 2022 NIH-supported study on &lt;strong&gt;nobiletin&lt;/strong&gt;, a key citrus flavonoid. “The compounds we isolate in lab settings are already present in these materials, often in high concentrations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Scent to Synapses: A Cognitive Link Emerges&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond the sensory and antimicrobial appeal lies a more surprising development: &lt;strong&gt;neurological research&lt;/strong&gt;. A 2022 review in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9103913/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; analyzed dozens of studies exploring the effect of &lt;strong&gt;citrus flavonoids&lt;/strong&gt;—especially &lt;strong&gt;nobiletin&lt;/strong&gt;—on memory, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In human clinical trials, citrus peel extracts taken over several weeks improved &lt;strong&gt;memory scores&lt;/strong&gt; and increased &lt;strong&gt;brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)&lt;/strong&gt; levels—an important protein linked to cognitive resilience and synaptic plasticity. These effects were observed not only in elderly subjects but also in patients with &lt;strong&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;early-stage Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cinnamon also contributes to this equation. Preliminary studies suggest its compounds may act as &lt;strong&gt;insulin sensitizers&lt;/strong&gt;, improving glucose uptake in the brain—an important function, given that impaired glucose metabolism is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/a-surprising-sleeping-pill-could-hold-the-key-to-fighting-alzheimers-new-study-suggests/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="74549" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurodegenerative disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the boiling method delivers lower concentrations than clinical doses, vapor exposure and ingestion from repurposed decoctions (e.g., used as tea or cleaning agent) may still provide a low-grade delivery of bioactives, especially in consistent daily use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Household Utility and Public Health Implications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a functional standpoint, the decoction left after boiling orange peels and cinnamon holds further value. Users report it works effectively as a &lt;strong&gt;natural surface cleaner&lt;/strong&gt;, a floor rinse, and a room spray—each reapplication extending the ingredient’s lifecycle while reducing dependence on &lt;strong&gt;chemical-laden products&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More importantly, the antimicrobial profile of these compounds opens the door for &lt;strong&gt;low-cost health interventions&lt;/strong&gt; in under-resourced settings. In regions where air purification or access to over-the-counter disinfectants is limited, heat-activated citrus and spice compounds may offer a scalable, sustainable alternative with minimal environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, researchers caution against overextension. “The evidence is promising but not conclusive,” said Dr. Akira Nakajima, a metabolic health researcher at the University of Tokyo. “We’re seeing enough positive trends to warrant clinical trials, but not enough for public health policy shifts—yet.”&lt;/p&gt;

Beneath our skin lies one of the most complex and mysterious systems in the universe, and experts are struggling to piece together how and why it all functions the way it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;Someone recently asked doctors, "&lt;strong&gt;What’s a mystery about the human body that science still hasn’t fully explained?&lt;/strong&gt;" and the answers came pouring in faster than you can say, "I really don't know." It wasn't only medical experts giving their two cents, but also ordinary people who've been met with blank stares after asking a doctor about something seemingly simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ql-align-justify"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/strong&gt; has put together a list of the best answers for you to scroll through while you wonder why you get goosebumps, talk in your sleep, or why yawning is contagious.

Why do we do it?

As with other mysteries, scientists are divided about what purpose dreaming actually serves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9616248"&gt;  &lt;p id="9616248" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/human-body-mysteries-15-690c65cd571e5__700.jpg" alt="Person lying on a pillow with hand covering face, illustrating mysteries about the human body and its unexplained science." title="Person lying on a pillow with hand covering face, illustrating mysteries about the human body and its unexplained science."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Autoimmune anything. I used to think it was pretty straightforward then I was diagnosed with a disorder. Everything is so hit and miss and open to interpretation, even bloodwork. I went from seropositive to seronegative at one point, how??? Do antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and ana just disappear? Or fluctuate? Depends on the rheumotologist you ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Symptoms all overlap for so many similar things and the treatments all work differently for different people until sometimes they randomly don't or do for awhile then quit. Maybe you have Lupus maybe you have Arthritis? Can't be sure so take this malaria medicine about it and let me know if you get mouth sores, your liver swells up, or it does nothing for no reason. Could be the meds, could be a flair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either way it's going to affect parts of your body you never knew interacted. How is your relationship with gluten and dairy because it's about to get weird. Which came first, the depression or the inflamation? No idea, but here's another four pills about it. You're hypermobile ever heard of Elors Danlos or pots?

We can observe the functioning of the hardware through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. We can even identify which parts of the brain are active when we feel happiness, sadness, or recognize a face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But we have no idea how this electrical and chemical activity results in the creation of the subjective, first-person perception of seeing the color red, feeling heat, or possessing a sense of self. This is what philosophers call the hard problem of consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are becoming extremely good at imitating the functions of the brain with artificial intelligence, but we haven't even begun to try to imitate the experience itself. It is the greatest mystery that exists.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1oo8hbr/doctors_of_reddit_whats_a_mystery_about_the_human/nn5pvtj/" target="_blank"&gt; ZestycloseHawk5743 &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/young-man-making-presentation-virtual-classroom_20861007.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=3&amp;amp;uuid=e8ce7e69-9b83-46dd-b550-c55ff41b9705&amp;amp;query=person+room" target="_blank"&gt; Freepik (not the actual photo) &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-10970-15/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A popular theory suggests that dreaming is how your brain sorts through the memories of the day, deciding which ones are valuable and which are irrelevant," reports the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other scientists, though, believe that dreaming actually serves no real function and that it’s just what our unconscious mind does when untethered by our awake selves," it adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="9616257"&gt;  &lt;p id="9616257" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/human-body-mysteries-16-690c660f9530d__700.jpg" alt="Doctor in white coat reviewing an X-ray while a patient with IV drip sits in a chair, highlighting mysteries about the human body." title="Doctor in white coat reviewing an X-ray while a patient with IV drip sits in a chair, highlighting mysteries about the human body."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Not a doctor, but recently went through cancer treatment.

Most of it is partially explained. A lot of engineering-types of people come into the hospital expecting the body to be explained- if there’s a problem you simply need to find the bug and fix it let me see the data I can do it myself - and then they get wildly disappointed when symptoms and lab values and imaging don’t correlate one to one, that medications have side effects that sometimes are worse than the problem they are meant to solve, and that replacement of one organ doesn’t fix the rest of the organs that are failing, even if the damage was all related to the first organ. The idea that humans and their body parts have a life span is both innate understood and yet impossible for many people to comprehend. Anyway- there’s more that we don’t know than that we know about how it all works.

At-risk people who walked 3,000 to 5,000 steps a day saw cognitive decline that was delayed by three years. Those who logged 5,000 to 7,500 steps a day had cognitive decline delayed by seven years. On the flip side, people who were sedentary had a faster buildup of tau proteins in the brain and faster declines in cognition and daily functioning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;What’s behind this? Doctors explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-might-3000-steps-a-day-lower-your-risk-of-alzheimers-disease" data-node-id="11" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Why might 3,000+ steps a day lower your risk of Alzheimer’s disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;There are likely a few things driving this, according to doctors. The biggest reason that people showed signs of cognitive decline in the study seemed to be linked to the buildup of tau plaques in the brain, says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/23351/wai-ying-yau" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/23351/wai-ying-yau" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, M.D" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Wai-Ying Wendy Yau, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., study co-author and a cognitive neurologist in the Mass General Brigham Department of Neurology. But exercise seems to help combat the buildup of those plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“Exercise tends to bring down inflammation, and inflammation is an important part of Alzheimer’s disease progress and process,” Dr. Yau says. “By decreasing inflammation, it could have an impact on how tau chemically changes and then tends to aggregate and clump together to form these deposits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Exercise is also good for cardiovascular health, points out &lt;a href="https://medsites.vumc.org/person/evan-brittain-md-msci" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://medsites.vumc.org/person/evan-brittain-md-msci" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Evan Brittain, M.D." data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Evan Brittain, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of medicine in the division of cardiovascular medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “Regular walking improves blood flow, reduces inflammation, and enhances metabolic health, all of which support brain function,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Being physically active may also promote neuroplasticity, which is the brain’s ability to change and adapt. “That could slow the buildup of harmful proteins central to Alzheimer’s pathology,” Dr. Brittain says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While the idea that exercise is good for the brain isn’t new, the concept of walking 3,000+ steps to reduce or slowing brain tau build-up is, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clifford Segil, D.O" data-node-id="16.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Clifford Segil, D.O&lt;/a&gt;., a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“This is a novel idea,” he says. “How walking can [impact] an aging brain protein needs to be evaluated.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-other-forms-of-exercise-help-too" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Can other forms of exercise help, too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;While this particular study just looked at step count, Dr. Yau says it’s likely that other types of exercise could be beneficial, too. “The beauty of using a pedometer is that it’s easy to understand and accessible,” she says. “The limitation is that we’re not capturing some of these other non-step forms of exercise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Brittain agrees. “The key factor is sustained movement that raises heart rate and engages large muscle groups,” he says. “Biking, swimming, or even brisk household activity could all confer similar benefits."&lt;br data-node-id="20.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="more-movement-is-better" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;More movement is better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Yau points out that her research found that the benefits of exercise on tau buildup plateaued after 7,500 steps a day. But she also says that more work needs to be done to tease out why that might be the case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Still, “more exercise is likely better,” Dr. Brittain says. Exercising as you age is also good for your heart and brain, Dr. Segil says. “Weight bearing exercises maintain bone density, lubricate our joints, and maintain muscle mass as we age,” he says. “Cardiovascular exercises maintain our hearts and increase blood flow to our brains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;But Dr. Brittain says it’s “encouraging” that walking lower amounts, like 3,000 to 5,000 steps seems to matter for brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="other-ways-to-lower-your-alzheimers-disease-risk" data-node-id="25" class="body-h2 css-ne8qws emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="25.0"&gt;Other ways to lower your Alzheimer’s disease risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Again, researchers are still exploring why some people develop Alzheimer’s disease and others don’t. But there are some general recommendations for what you can to do try to lower your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“There has been enough evidence so far that exercise is beneficial for health in general, including brain health and cognitive health,” Dr. Yau says. “We’re highlighting that exercise can affect tau [accumulation]. We hope this provides extra motivation to some people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Consistency is key, according to Dr. Brittain. “Daily movement, even light walking, can improve both heart and brain health,” he says. “You don’t need a perfect routine. What matters is making physical activity a regular part of your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Doing your best to prevent and manage diabetes, manage your blood pressure, prevent or correct hearing loss, and limit or avoid alcohol and smoking may also help, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alzheimers-dementia/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cdc.gov/alzheimers-dementia/prevention/index.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention" data-node-id="29.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; (CDC). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Yau stresses that you don’t need to suddenly become a marathoner to lower your risk of Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline. “We’re seeing a difference in our participants with even slightly more activity a day,” she says. “Even a little bit helps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOXzlWRXFpM1pqUl9FUGxjbjNhTWdfU0ZzOW5RbTVnYXhLMTJhUUdHSElHSXBsc2dpZUptQ0Vud1AzRkpROTdKUHlGbHJuMHktbjdna0lGQmFUQ29CWUVlZFlIcWpNVTdvd1FMZDdmaGFyR2lLM2lYZVkybVhUZ3dnREQ4SXBqWVlTUGZNS1ZrOGJZR3Ex</guid></item><item><title>克菲尔和益生元纤维组合可能比Omega-3补充剂更能减少炎症- Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/kefir-fiber-synbiotic-supplement-inflammation-11839875</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway_1-0" class="comp health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway health-sc-block-callout-base mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-key-takeaway theme-key-takeaway" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study found that kefir combined with prebiotic fiber, known as a synbiotic, reduced inflammation more effectively than omega-3 or prebiotic supplements alone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The kefir-based synbiotic may boost production of butyrate, a compound that supports gut immunity and helps lower inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts say synbiotics can be done through food pairings like yogurt with fruit or kimchi with rice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people take omega-3 supplements to reduce inflammation, but a new study suggests that combining prebiotic fiber and kefir may offer greater anti-inflammatory benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the study, researchers compared three supplements: a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-you-take-prebiotics-and-probiotics-together-11749148" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;synbiotic supplement&lt;/a&gt; (a mix of prebiotics and probiotics), an omega-3 supplement, and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/prebiotics-and-ibs-1944748" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotic plant fiber&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All three supplements were linked to reduced inflammation, but the kefir-based synbiotic had the strongest impact. This is likely because the supplement delivers both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/probiotics-7488911" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;good microbes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/probiotics-plus-fiber-gut-health-8776590" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fibers that feed them&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dramrita-vijay/?originalSubdomain=uk" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Amrita Vijay, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, lead author of the study and a senior researcher at the University of Nottingham.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This combination boosts production of butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid that supports gut immunity and helps lower inflammation, Vijay said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to lowering inflammation, previous studies have linked synbiotics with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-to-improve-gut-health-11712148" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;improved gut health&lt;/a&gt;, immunity, and weight loss in some people.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Synbiotics might be an easy way to get both healthy gut microbes and the food they need to survive, but there are plenty of unknowns about these combination supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "We’re still learning a lot about synbiotics, including which types, doses, and timing are most effective and for whom," &lt;a href="https://www.henryford.com/blog/tags/ashlee-carnahan" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ashlee Carnahan, MS, RDN, CLC,&lt;/a&gt; manager of nutrition and education services and dietetic internship director at Henry Ford Health in Detroit, told Verywell in an email.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It's a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider before trying a synbiotic, especially if you have a chronic condition or a weakened immune system, Carnahan added.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are synbiotic food pairings that don't involve pills or powders.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Some combinations would be yogurt, which is your probiotic, with bananas or berries, which give you prebiotics. Or kimchi, which is your probiotic, with stir-fried vegetables and rice for your prebiotic," &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/vanessa-king" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vanessa King, MS, RDN, CNSC&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics based in Los Angeles, California, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, you don't need to stress too much about making the perfect synbiotic food pairing. You will likely hit the targets you need if you eat a wide variety of flavorful foods, King added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-synbiotics-really-better-than-omega-3s"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Are Synbiotics Really Better Than Omega-3s? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to add synbiotics to your diet, don't cut out omega-3s. The new study linked synbiotics with a stronger anti-inflammatory effect, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/benefits-of-omega-3-11772277" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; still had an anti-inflammatory effect and offer other benefits for brain and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "Even though the study shows that it wasn't as effective for this particular activity in the body, omega-3s are critical to our health. They're an essential nutrient that we need to get from our food, because our body can't make it," King said.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study focused on supplements, but evidence has shown that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-high-in-omega-3-11686761" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3s food sources&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fatty-fish-11837132" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fatty fish&lt;/a&gt;, provide more health benefits than supplements.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For maximum benefits, find ways to add probiotics, prebiotics, and omega-3s into your diet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "One of my favorite breakfast combos is omega-3 eggs mixed with avocados, your prebiotic, and sauerkraut as your probiotic. And that is just divine, and really will deliver that anti-inflammatory power," King said.&lt;br&gt;

Unlike in big cities, resources for homelessness, addiction, and harm prevention in these communities are scarce. Over the past decade, rural parts of &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/77493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/77493"&gt;Kentucky, Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2025/01/08/west-virginia-hiv-syringe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://undark.org/2025/01/08/west-virginia-hiv-syringe/"&gt;West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; have reported surges in HIV infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In 2023, Penobscot County had the second-highest number of overdoses, both fatal and nonfatal, among all Maine counties, &lt;a href="https://mainedrugdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-12-ME_OD_Report-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://mainedrugdata.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2023-12-ME_OD_Report-Final.pdf"&gt;state data showed&lt;/a&gt;, which only hints at the extent of the region’s addiction troubles, said Gunderman. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A now-defunct homeless encampment facilitated the spread of the virus, but closing it in February made it harder to contact and treat the people at risk, health experts said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The outbreak is sustained and exacerbated by the privations of homelessness. For people with nothing, sex becomes an asset to trade for drugs or shelter, Gunderman said, and the virus is exchanged along with it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Also contributing to the outbreak: the closure earlier this year of the region’s primary HIV case management provider and source of sterile syringes. Among other services, the Health Equity Alliance, or HEAL, coordinated transportation to appointments, connected people with food and housing, and helped them enroll in programs that make medications more affordable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Jessica Emery, who last week huddled in the doorway of a vacant Bangor storefront, said she visits a needle exchange every three days. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I had a life, I’m trying to get back to that,” said Emery, 43, who worked as a certified residential medication aide before becoming homeless about a year ago. “I don’t want to catch anything while I’m out here.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;On a recent Friday, Cronk walked the desolate railroad tracks toward his tent. The nearby river reflected the orange and auburn foliage of late autumn. He acknowledged a small piece of good news: his girlfriend, who is pregnant, recently tested negative for HIV. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The roughly beautiful surroundings belie a precarious existence, he said. He and his girlfriend found their tent slashed and their food stolen a few nights earlier. They slept that night in a corner of the tent that gave a little shelter against heavy rain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He’s not using drugs, he said, but over the past month hasn’t been able to afford the medications he needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Every day I feel like I’m dying,” he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 railless margin_horizontal_10 width_max_1080"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

            Doctor after doctor misdiagnosed or shrugged off Ruth Wilson’s rashes, swelling, fevers and severe pain for six years. She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00063b6qvjxs9znr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman’s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/autoimmune-lupus-women-rheumatoid-arthritis-aff0e28dece3ef4168f301bd84331ea5" target="_blank"&gt;immune system had been attacking her own body&lt;/a&gt; all that time and nobody caught it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00073b6qixgq0dc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00083b6q8fch1q06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms — and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues’ gallery of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nobel-prize-medicine-a68cf8a3b930570630168a949d277cde" target="_blank"&gt;autoimmune diseases&lt;/a&gt; that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide – hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine’s biggest mysteries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv00093b6q2fcngnva@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They’re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones – in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000a3b6qj4dnhvho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a daunting task. That friendly fire ravages nerves in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-epstein-barr-study-b325dceb5612e4ec7f22c8f25901e5eb" target="_blank"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, inflames joints in rheumatoid arthritis, dries out the eyes and mouth in Sjögren’s disease, destroys insulin production in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/barbie-introduces-type-1-diabetes-doll-b60ab201a42604aeec03ba06346e1197" target="_blank"&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, weakens muscles in myositis and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/tennis-monica-seles-health-myasthenia-gravis-b36b3d132edc3e7eecde19ca759e36ff" target="_blank"&gt;myasthenia gravis&lt;/a&gt; — and in &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/wnba-liberty-isabelle-harrison-brother-lupus-6f5a30c2610f57fe64923e8c80093144" target="_blank"&gt;lupus&lt;/a&gt;, it can cause body-wide havoc.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000b3b6qll4n17v5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that’s often invisible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000c3b6qbrqj4t7l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You look normal. People see you and they don’t think you have this horrible disease,” said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000d3b6qxy6d7uuh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While there’s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000e3b6qhh87x2c2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients’ own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It’s called CAR-T therapy and early results with these “living drugs” are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000f3b6q5vu17ss0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they’ll need insulin. Citing that “tantalizing evidence,” the NIH’s new five-year plan for autoimmune research — if it gets funded — urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000g3b6q9ugqkylg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is probably the most exciting time that we’ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,” said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000h3b6q2ndmphgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers – T cells and antibody-producing B cells — how to distinguish what’s foreign from what’s “you.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000i3b6qz2jrr96q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000j3b6qvvx6nhy1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/multiple-sclerosis-ancient-dna-c8fbfe4ba7d4e2447eec52c6000878dc" target="_blank"&gt;once protected our ancestors&lt;/a&gt; from long-ago threats including the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/oddities-science-health-plague-bubonic-04349f994460d01c56fe5a57960b6ce8" target="_blank"&gt;Black Death&lt;/a&gt; but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdv000k3b6qs5pv4o57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “genes are not everything,” said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH’s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000l3b6qf3fkrs5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn’t guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000m3b6q1vhkb5ke@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, ‘That’s it, I can’t handle any more of these insults,’” said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000n3b6qw2jcejyi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That’s especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000o3b6q19h9o01m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000p3b6qckj30y1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog — difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking — wax and wane.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000r3b6q01gp6srt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000s3b6qrc1zksu1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not a bad life, it’s just a bad day,” she tells herself to get through.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000t3b6qci0f86b1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000u3b6qenyu69yt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are my babies,” said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan’s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000v3b6qvymza1cs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kwong is performing something so tricky it’s not done in many laboratories: He’s growing batches of neutrophils, the body’s most common white blood cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000w3b6q4pocl0dk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they’re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000x3b6quy3po3wg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000y3b6qhjecmdjg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw000z3b6qloq1gust@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We think that’s a fundamental initial process,” Kaplan said. “We’re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00103b6qavbaxovb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan’s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key — by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00113b6qiv9stoqd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But neutrophils don’t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients’ blood won’t show how they went awry — something Kwong’s baby neutrophils may aid.
    &lt;/p&gt;







  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00123b6qams46bm8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00133b6qeyietzkd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That suggests “lupus is not a single disease,” Kaplan said. “What we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00143b6q0j1luyef@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            How to subtype lupus isn’t clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00153b6qy25ts1d9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients’ joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00163b6qxth1jrox@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It “changed how we think about the disease,” said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00173b6qst7q6z7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs — and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00183b6qlbu9vhxr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she’d answer some medical students’ questions. Wilson remembers many knew “what lupus looks like in a textbook” but not the patient perspective.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw00193b6qagpmpfk1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001a3b6q72nhsw6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments — and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can’t conquer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001b3b6qkb1h30ac@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001c3b6q186ao40e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are “only capturing half the story,” she said. “If a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001d3b6qmtpit49k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While her doctor isn’t recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhnudwdw001e3b6q6v0um3dh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,” Wilson said. For a long time, “I never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For decades, babies have been wincing, squirming and crying their way through a series of vaccinations that start as soon as they're born. The shots protect against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and mumps, which once plagued children and their parents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When I was a kid, my parents were terrified about my catching polio or measles or whatever. And friends of mine died," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p1554" target="_blank"&gt;Stanley Plotkin&lt;/a&gt;, a veteran vaccine scientist who is now 93 and a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"A parent today very likely does not worry about his or her child dying of an infectious disease," he adds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's because routine childhood vaccinations have largely vanquished many diseases, making vaccines one of medicine's greatest triumphs.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned the safety and effectiveness of many vaccines. And President Trump recently called for big changes in how children get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies it's a disgrace. I don't see it. I think it's very bad," Trump said recently at a White House event. "It looks like they're pumping into a horse."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So a powerful Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee hand-picked by Kennedy is now &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/child-adolescent-age.html" target="_blank"&gt;scrutinizing the childhood vaccine schedule&lt;/a&gt;. The schedule is the finely calibrated timetable pediatricians use to administer the sequence of more than 30 doses to protect against more than a dozen diseases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The move is being welcomed by some advocates, physicians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it is true that any vaccine schedule should periodically be assessed," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.childrenshospital.org/directory/ofer-levy" target="_blank"&gt;Ofer Levy,&lt;/a&gt; a vaccine scientist at Harvard. "As we like to say, 'Moses did not come down from Mount Sinai saying: 'This will be the only way that you immunize.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But others worry the review is part of Kennedy's campaign against vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has for 20 years been an anti-vaccine activist and science-denialist. You would have hoped that when he was confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services he would have taken on his job, which is to protect the health of children in this country. But he didn't," says Dr.&lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a" target="_blank"&gt; Paul Offit&lt;/a&gt;, who runs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "All he cares about is making vaccines less available, less affordable and more feared."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Federal officials did not respond to NPR's questions about a possible overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The scrutiny is especially troubling to many public health authorities, coming amid &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of diseases like measles and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/28/nx-s1-5576494/louisiana-whooping-cough-pertussis-infant-deaths" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;whooping cough&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These are on the rise because of falling immunization rates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Offit and others say every vaccine is meticulously evaluated before being added to the schedule. And researchers and regulators continually monitor all vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"All the data and evidence suggest that our vaccine schedule is incredibly safe and incredibly effective," Dr. &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/yvonne-maldonado" target="_blank"&gt;Yvonne Maldonado&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Stanford University. "In fact, it is probably the most effective vaccine schedule in the world."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Kids get this roster of shots at a young age to make sure they don't catch dangerous diseases when they're most vulnerable, Maldonado and others say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people who are worried about vaccines argue the number of different antigens and other ingredients could overwhelm a child's immune system. But babies' immune systems can handle it, says Maldonado and other scientists. Children are exposed to far more stimulation naturally from microbes than from vaccines. And vaccines have been refined over the decades to minimize the number of ingredients they contain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are about 170 different components in the various shots in today's vaccine schedule, Offit says, which is "actually less than the vaccines that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I got as children of the early 1950s," Offit says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Experts are especially alarmed that the CDC is investigating splitting up the MMR vaccine, which protects kids against measles, mumps and rubella in one shot. Giving kids three separate shots would mean more trips to the doctor and more needles, vaccine proponents like Offit say. They worry that, inevitably, more kids would end up missing vaccines. And it would take years to develop new individual shots, according to the proponents.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;a href="https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014TNITAA4/jesse-l-goodman" target="_blank"&gt;Jesse Goodman&lt;/a&gt;, a vaccine expert at Georgetown University who used to regulate vaccines at the Food and Drug Administration, says: "It's as if you had this really winning football team and you said, 'Well, gee, we're winning. We win every season. We win every game. Let's change everything we're doing."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;You won't find &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-warns-why-you-should-never-become-your-own-dentist="&gt;visits to the dentist&lt;/a&gt; at the top of most people's lists of fun activities, but check-ups could be made easier by a gel that repairs and replaces damaged tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the work of an international team led by researchers at the University of Nottingham in the UK, and it has the potential to fill a gap in our extremely limited &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/axolotl-discovery-brings-us-closer-than-ever-to-regrowing-human-limbs"&gt;regenerative capabilities&lt;/a&gt;: We can't naturally regrow tooth enamel once it has decayed away, but replacing this protective covering on damaged teeth could help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/there-could-be-a-link-between-tooth-decay-and-our-immune-system"&gt;tooth decay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like some previous attempts to regrow enamel, this new gel mimics how tooth enamel gets laid down in the first place&lt;/span&gt;. The new solution can fill in cracks in teeth, and be applied on top of bare, exposed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentin"&gt;dentine&lt;/a&gt; (the bone-like bulk of a tooth, below the enamel).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toothpick-grooves-in-neanderthal-teeth-arent-what-we-thought"&gt;'Toothpick Grooves' in Neanderthal Teeth Aren't What We Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When our material is applied to demineralized or eroded enamel, or exposed dentine, the material promotes the growth of crystals in an integrated and organized manner, recovering the architecture of our natural healthy enamel," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/new-gel-restores-dental-enamel-and-could-revolutionise-tooth-repair"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmaceutical scientist Abshar Hasan of the University of Nottingham in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When enamel grows for the first time, it does so via a scaffold made by natural proteins called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelogenin"&gt;amelogenin&lt;/a&gt;. Here, the researchers attempted to replicate that scaffolding using proteins called elastin-like recombinamers or ELRs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180267" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GrowingEnamel.jpg" alt="Growing enamel image" class="wp-image-180267 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GrowingEnamel.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/GrowingEnamel-600x350.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180267" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Electron microscope images showing the protective coating on teeth with demineralized enamel (left) can be restored after two weeks with the new treatment (right)&lt;/span&gt;. (Hasan et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Commun.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This synthetic scaffolding then works like the natural equivalent, encouraging the growth of new enamel through a process known as epitaxial mineralization. New enamel crystals form from calcium and phosphate in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-smart-dental-floss-can-detect-your-stress-from-saliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt;, or, in the case of these lab experiments, in a solution added to extracted teeth after the scaffold has been built up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the new crystals are seamlessly aligned with the crystals in whatever part of the natural dentine or enamel remains. Furthermore, the resulting enamel shows signs of being just as strong as the material it's replacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have tested the mechanical properties of these regenerated tissues under conditions simulating real-life situations – such as tooth brushing, chewing, and exposure to acidic foods – and found that the regenerated enamel behaves just like healthy enamel," &lt;a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/new-gel-restores-dental-enamel-and-could-revolutionise-tooth-repair"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tooth decay is such a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/affluent-children-are-more-likely-to-have-a-common-dental-problem-here-s-why"&gt;big health problem&lt;/a&gt; that for years scientists have been testing and developing ways to replace worn enamel, including the use of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-develop-world-first-liquid-that-regenerates-damaged-tooth-enamel"&gt;liquids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/peptide-based-technology-could-heal-dental-cavities-amelogenins"&gt;peptides&lt;/a&gt;. One day we might even be able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/lab-grown-teeth-are-another-step-closer-to-reality-scientists-reveal"&gt;grow entire teeth&lt;/a&gt; in laboratory settings, ready for transplanting into mouths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stands out as one of the most promising developments so far though. It's easy and quick to apply – ultimately, a dentist could do it – and it outperforms the other options currently available for this kind of process, according to the researchers, who have founded a start-up to further their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this still needs to be carefully tested in actual human mouths rather than just the lab so the researchers can determine whether it's safe. That's something they want to address in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These results suggest that our technology could potentially provide a one-pot solution for the regeneration of dental enamel independently of the level of tooth erosion," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64982-y"&gt;the researchers conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-64982-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials showed the twice-a-year injectable, called &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/18/fda-approves-gilead-hiv-prevention-drug-lenacapavir-yeztugo-next-best-thing-to-vaccine/"&gt;Yeztugo, was highly effective in preventing the infectious disease&lt;/a&gt;, prompting enthusiasm about combating HIV globally. But the pharmacy benefits manager has argued that the $28,000 price tag — before any rebates or discounts — in the U.S. is too high.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just the same, other large insurers have started to cover the drug, and Gilead has told Wall Street analysts that about 90% of the targeted patient population should have access by June 2026. However, some critics argue the price will make it difficult to contain the disease in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

The fruit of &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii Kom&lt;/em&gt;, long used in traditional medicine, showed strong potential to fight insulin resistance and restore healthy metabolism in diabetic mice. The plant extract not only helped stabilize blood sugar but also corrected several related issues, including abnormal fat metabolism and oxidative stress. These results were linked to the activation of a key cellular signaling system that regulates how the body processes glucose and energy. The discovery points to the possibility of safer, naturally derived treatments for one of the world's most widespread chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people living with diabetes is expected to climb to 750 million by 2045. While modern drugs can control symptoms, many come with side effects and do not address the underlying causes of metabolic imbalance. This has led scientists to revisit nature's medicine cabinet in search of new therapeutic options. Among these is &lt;em&gt;Nitraria roborowskii Kom&lt;/em&gt;, a tough shrub that thrives in the harsh deserts of western China. Its bright red fruits, sometimes known as "desert cherries," have nourished and healed local communities for centuries. Only recently have researchers begun to uncover the biological mechanisms behind its traditional use, prompting systematic scientific investigations into its potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakthrough Study Confirms Potent Diabetes-Fighting Properties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collaborative study between Qinghai University and the Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, published in the &lt;em&gt;Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy&lt;/em&gt;, provided strong experimental evidence of the fruit's effects. Using well-controlled trials, scientists tested a concentrated form of the extract (NRK-C) on diabetic mice over seven weeks. The results were striking: the compound not only lowered blood sugar and improved insulin responsiveness but also addressed broader metabolic dysfunctions through a previously underexplored biological route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Desert Berry Restores Metabolic Balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detailed analysis revealed the extract's impressive range of benefits. Over the course of seven weeks, NRK-C reduced fasting blood glucose levels by 30-40% in diabetic mice, with stronger results at higher doses. It also improved insulin sensitivity by roughly 50% compared with untreated animals. In addition to these improvements, the extract balanced cholesterol and lowered oxidative stress markers by as much as 60%, a rare feat for any single therapeutic compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further investigation showed that NRK-C works by reactivating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway -- a critical metabolic circuit that often breaks down in diabetes. This reactivation appears to "reboot" the body's ability to regulate glucose and fat metabolism. Microscopic examination supported these findings, revealing healthier liver and pancreatic tissue structures in treated mice compared with untreated ones. Taken together, these findings suggest the compound helps the body reset its metabolic function rather than just masking symptoms. Its naturally broad effects contrast sharply with the narrowly targeted mechanisms of many pharmaceutical drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert Insight: A Holistic Approach to Diabetes Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results are exciting because they suggest we might be able to treat diabetes more holistically," said Dr. Yue Huilan, a senior researcher on the project. "Instead of just lowering blood sugar like most medications, this plant extract appears to help the body regain its natural metabolic balance. The implications could extend beyond diabetes to other conditions involving insulin resistance." While the team emphasized that human trials are still needed, the findings represent an encouraging move toward more natural and comprehensive approaches to diabetes care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery opens up several promising research directions. Pharmaceutical developers may pursue standardized NRK-C extracts as supplements or adjunct therapies, while nutrition experts could explore adding the fruit to functional foods aimed at metabolic health. The results also lend modern scientific support to traditional medicinal knowledge, helping bridge ancient practice and contemporary medicine. Researchers are particularly eager to determine whether NRK-C could help prevent diabetes in high-risk individuals or reduce complications in those already affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly, the findings underscore the value of preserving and studying traditional medicinal plants, many of which may hold untapped potential for addressing modern health challenges. Nature, it seems, still has many healing secrets waiting to be rediscovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
