Mosquito-borne illnesses such as dengue fever are good examples, because they only proliferate in areas where the temperature and rainfall are beneficial for the mosquito population to grow, as well as for the disease itself to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, as the Earth heats up due to air pollution, more and more of the world fits those conditions — and dengue fever is already becoming a more widespread problem, as a new study covered by the Stanford Report &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:revealed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study was conducted by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, Arizona State University, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. It was published in September in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers examined how much the Earth's rising temperature will increase cases of dengue fever in the future — and how much it already has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The effects of temperature were much larger than I expected," said lead author Marissa Childs, an assistant professor of environmental health at the University of Washington, per the &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stanford Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stanford Report&lt;/a&gt;. "Even small shifts in temperature can have a big impact for dengue transmission, and we're already seeing the fingerprint of climate warming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So exactly how large was that fingerprint? After examining 1.4 million cases of the disease across 21 countries, researchers determined that climate change is responsible for an additional 4.6 million infections each year, representing an 18% increase in the disease's incidence. By 2050, the rate could climb another 49% to 76%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this result important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dengue fever, also called "breakbone fever," is a painful and potentially serious illness. In severe cases, it can cause debilitating pain and can lead to death. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, those who contract it more than once are at greater risk of experiencing a severe case. And as the world heats up, more and more people who have never been exposed to this illness before are now at risk — a fact which has already had a death toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This is not just hypothetical future change but a large amount of human suffering that has already happened because of warming-driven dengue transmission," &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2025/09/dengue-fever-rates-climate-change-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; senior author Erin Mordecai, a professor of biology from the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences, per the Stanford Report. "Climate change is not just affecting the weather — it has cascading consequences for human health, including fueling disease transmission by mosquitoes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about dengue fever transmission?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Recent research into vaccinations has yielded results that promise to reduce the spread of dengue fever worldwide. Some local governments are also working on directly controlling the mosquito population to thereby stop the spread of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the only long-term solution for the broader problem of diseases that spread more rapidly in warmer temperatures is to reduce the Earth's temperature by reducing air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?rec9bh39sND8fgERx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 00:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQUndCb3VRRFRaSl9UTW5OTWtwTndjRHN6RWVEbFpwbnlPcUF0ZGNiTjJLbnhLcTNGdnlJOVpCMy1CVGlKZzdGVFBmT201d3RLaTNkODNLaGpTcF9BSEY2NUJaSEU5ZmhvcnY2UjdJRGxrRzA4clhwWGUzQnA4d2FCM0k2QjFzNG5IdUJHeWJDZDdXdw</guid></item><item><title>我播出的“脑雾”时刻如何引发了一场大辩论- BBC</title><link>https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpkenx9dzo</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 idLnWK"&gt;How my on-air 'brain fog' moment sparked a big debate&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-0 fYJjWP"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-11 ljQVMv"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-5 xGeVU"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="sc-7bfdb3c2-7 djOqvY"&gt;Zoe Kleinman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-new-contributors-contributor-0-role-location" class="sc-7bfdb3c2-8 gvcwmG"&gt;Technology editor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gtLOOD"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b951/live/f3930a20-c136-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman holding notes as she speaks on the BBC News at Ten" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Due to "brain fog" BBC technology editor Zoe Kleinman had to hold notes during a recent live TV report&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When I rather nervously shared a personal post about dealing with brain fog at work on the social network LinkedIn last week, I had no idea that it would have such an enormous impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's been &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7393223331946332160/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;viewed&lt;/a&gt; hundreds of thousands of times. Women have stopped me on the street to talk to me about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I've been overwhelmed by hundreds of messages from people sharing support and their own experiences of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Usually I cover technology news.

There can of course be other neurological conditions for which brain fog can be a symptom too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If you're in a job where public speaking is part of what you do, it can be particularly terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've spent 30 years being professionally articulate," wrote Janet Edgecombe, an internal communications expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"All of a sudden I'm forgetting the words for basic things.

But of course it can also hit mid-conversation, in a more intimate but no less frustrating way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;My post was about my decision to hold a page of notes on the BBC News at Ten. A story had broken late in the afternoon, following an already busy day, and by the time we reached 10pm, I knew I was getting tired and I could feel the brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I was going to talk about an outage that was affecting dozens of websites and apps, and I planned to use the technical jargon for it, as given by the company affected, and then explain what it actually meant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But I just couldn't get the phrase to stick in my head and I knew that without it, I wouldn't manage the rest of what I needed to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I was reporting live from Glasgow. Like many of my professional peers, I do not have, and I've never had, autocue. And so, for the first time, I decided at the last minute to hold a page of notes with the offending phrase on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It felt to me at the time like an admission of failure. I have been trained never to use notes – unless there's a specific legal reason why the wording of a statement, for example, has to be precise, or there are a lot of figures to remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even then, I have prided myself on having a good enough short-term memory to get me through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Using notes is discouraged in the world of public speaking. They are not permitted to anyone giving a 12-minute TED talk. The speaker is expected to memorise their speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Looking down the barrel of the camera and clutching that paper, live on TV, felt tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But around 10% of women report &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.fawcettsociety.org.uk/menopauseandtheworkplace" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;leaving their jobs&lt;/a&gt; due to menopause symptoms, according to the Fawcett Society. And research by insurance firm Royal London found that half of women going through it have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.royallondon.com/about-us/media/Media-Centre/press-releases/press-releases-2023/october/Menopause-talent-drain-half-of-women-going-through-menopause-are-considering-leaving-work/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;considered giving up work.&lt;/a&gt; I don't want to do that – and so I stuck with my solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;To my intense relief, some people said they thought my paper looked authoritative, that they just assumed it was a breaking story and the page contained fresh information. Others asked why I hadn't used a device instead – I suppose I thought the potential of having to fumble with a screen would feel even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Let's start a movement: Hold your notes," wrote Elisheva Marcus, vice president of communications at the venture capitalist firm Earlybird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And so, the hashtag holdthenotes was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Have you ever checked your testosterone levels?" menopause expert Dr Louise Newson asked me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She says testosterone – despite its reputation for being a male hormone, and its association with sex drive and libido, is actually an essential brain chemical for both men and women, and levels fall in both genders. One of the results is brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's like you've been drugged," she says.

Dr. Love points out that alcohol alters how the brain communicates, altering learning, memory, and decision-making. Chronic heavy drinking can even shrink the brain tissue itself and distort neurotransmitter balance, impeding neurons from communicating as they should.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alcohol also disrupts sleep quality, even though it may get you to sleep quicker, and disrupted sleep amplifies the toxic effect on the brain. Chronic alcohol consumption raises the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and, in severe cases, can result in permanent cognitive impairment. According to Dr. Love, if you can cut down or practice mindful drinking, you can spare your brain from further damage. For people who struggle with alcohol addiction, professional intervention can be life-changing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 23:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>由营养师创建的7天抗炎高纤维膳食计划- EatingWell</title><link>https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-anti-inflammatory-high-fiber-meal-plan-11847833</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-table__table-wrapper"&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;​​Is it OK to mix and match meals if there is one I do not like?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-to-make-first-8770807" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory recipes. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 390 to 452 calories while the lunches span 429 to 673 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;What is an anti-inflammatory diet?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_4-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-inflammatory diet focuses on eating foods high in antioxidants like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and beans, as well as healthy fats such as extra virgin olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, walnuts and flaxseeds. It limits consuming foods that may promote inflammation, such as ultra-processed foods and added sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

However, chronic inflammation is a low-grade, more long-term type of inflammation that is harder to notice and can lead to some negative health implications like higher chronic disease risk. Fortunately, eating an anti-inflammatory diet can help remedy some of the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7669105/sneaky-signs-you-could-have-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; that go with chronic inflammation, like joint pain, brain fog and low energy levels.

It helps keep you regular and also supports a healthy gut microbiome, which has been linked with improved immune function, better heart health, reduced risk of cognitive decline and more. Eating enough fiber not only benefits your gut, but additionally can help reduce inflammation. Research shows that higher fiber intake may lower inflammation markers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;I used to think happiness after 50 was about having things figured out. Like there was some magical wisdom download that happened when you hit middle age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, it's less about having answers and more about having practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people I know who seem genuinely content in their fifties and beyond aren't necessarily the ones who made all the right choices or avoided hardship. They're the ones who showed up for themselves in small, consistent ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I want to walk through seven daily rituals that these folks tend to share. Nothing groundbreaking. Nothing that requires a complete life overhaul. Just simple practices that compound over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1) They move their bodies without obsessing over it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what I've noticed about the happiest people over 50: they've stopped treating exercise like punishment for existing in a body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My grandmother is 72 and walks to the food bank every Saturday morning where she volunteers. Not because she's trying to hit 10,000 steps or burn calories, but because she likes the ritual of it. The movement is just part of the activity she loves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the pattern I keep seeing. Movement becomes something you do because it feels good, not because you're trying to fix something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it's a morning stretch routine. Maybe it's gardening. Maybe it's dancing in the kitchen while cooking dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is that it's integrated into life rather than being this separate thing you have to force yourself to do. There's no guilt when you skip a day, and no medal-chasing when you don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body at 50 is different than it was at 30, and the people who stay happy seem to have made peace with that reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2) They've learned to say no without explaining themselves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one took me way too long to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, I said yes to everything. Every social obligation, every work project, every favor asked of me. And then I'd resent the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happy 50-somethings I know have mastered the art of the simple no. No elaborate justification. No fake excuses. Just "that doesn't work for me" or "I'm not available."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds easy, but it requires you to get comfortable with other people being disappointed in you. Which, as Rudá Iandê writes in "Laughing in the Face of Chaos," "Being human means inevitably disappointing and hurting others, and the sooner you accept this reality, the easier it becomes to navigate life's challenges."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned this book before, but his insights about letting go of people-pleasing really shifted something for me. The book inspired me to start viewing my time as actually finite rather than just theoretically finite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you're in your twenties, you can kind of pretend you have unlimited energy and time. By 50, that illusion is harder to maintain. The people who stay happy seem to have accepted this and adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3) They maintain friendships that feel effortless&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of them. Not even most of them. But a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The genuinely happy older folks I know have stopped trying to maintain friendships that feel like work. They've let some relationships fade, and they've stopped feeling guilty about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they've kept are the connections that feel easy. The friend you can not talk to for six months and then pick up right where you left off. The person who doesn't need you to perform or pretend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner is 43, and watching him navigate friendships has taught me something important. He has maybe three or four people he actually stays in close contact with. But those relationships are deep. There's no small talk, no catching up for the sake of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality over quantity becomes less of a cliché and more of a necessity as you age. You just don't have the bandwidth to maintain surface-level connections anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And honestly? That's a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4) They cook for themselves regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound boring, but hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happiest people over 50 I know tend to cook. Not elaborate Instagram-worthy meals necessarily, but real food that they actually enjoy eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something grounding about feeding yourself well. It's a small act of self-respect that happens multiple times a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I make a big batch of lentil soup or spend Sunday afternoon prepping vegetables from the farmers market, I'm not just making food. I'm creating conditions for my future self to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who stay happy after 50 seem to have internalized this. They're not grabbing takeout every night or eating sad desk lunches. They're actually sitting down, even if just for 15 minutes, to eat something they prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't have to be fancy. My grandmother's favorite meal is toast with mashed avocado and tomatoes. But she makes it herself, plates it nicely, and sits at her table to eat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That small ritual matters more than you'd think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5) They've developed a practice that isn't about productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photography for me. Vinyl collecting. Reading fiction that has nothing to do with work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy people over 50 have something they do purely because it brings them joy, not because it's building toward anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is harder than it sounds in a culture that monetizes everything. We're trained to turn hobbies into side hustles, to optimize our leisure time, to make everything count toward some larger goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the people who maintain genuine happiness have protected at least one activity from that impulse. They have something they do just because.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My partner brews kombucha on weekends. It's not for Instagram. He's not selling it. He just likes the process of experimenting with flavors and watching the fermentation happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked him why he does it, he just shrugged and said "because it's interesting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. That's the whole reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find your version of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6) They've stopped arguing with reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably the biggest difference I've noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who stay happy after 50 have largely given up on the "should" game. Things should be different. People should behave better. Life should be fair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They've accepted that reality just is what it is, and arguing with it only creates suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my early thirties trying to convince people to go vegan through sheer force of moral argument. I had statistics, footage, all the ammunition I needed to prove I was right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was miserable. More importantly, I wasn't actually helping anyone change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until I stopped fighting reality, stopped insisting the world should already be the way I wanted it to be, that I actually became effective. And much, much happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happy older folks I know have all arrived at some version of this acceptance. They're not passive or resigned. They still work toward things. But they've stopped exhausting themselves by arguing with what already is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7) They get outside almost every day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if it's just for ten minutes. Even if it's just to their balcony or front porch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pattern is consistent: people who maintain happiness after 50 have some form of daily contact with the outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's research backing this up, of course. Nature exposure reduces stress, improves mood, all the things you'd expect. But I think it's more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting outside breaks the loop of your own thoughts. It reminds you that you're part of something larger than your immediate concerns and anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I live in Venice Beach, and my favorite time of day is early morning when I walk down to the water with my coffee. Not to exercise. Not to be productive. Just to remember that the ocean was here before me and will be here after me, and that puts my deadline stress into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who stay genuinely happy seem to have found their version of this. Maybe it's tending a garden. Maybe it's sitting on a park bench. Maybe it's walking their dog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The specific activity matters less than the regularity of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these rituals are revolutionary. You've probably heard versions of all of them before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what I've learned from watching people who actually stay happy after 50: it's not about knowing what to do. It's about actually doing it, consistently, without making it into a big dramatic thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't New Year's resolutions. They're just small choices, repeated daily, that compound into a life that feels good to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don't need to implement all seven tomorrow. Pick one. See how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who stay happy after 50 didn't get there by overhauling their entire lives at once. They got there by showing up for themselves in small ways, over and over, until those ways became who they are.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington — &lt;/em&gt;Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he's "very concerned" about a potential change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants, with a key advisory panel set to meet in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease," &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-cassidy-louisiana-senator-face-the-nation-transcript-11-16-2025/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Cassidy told "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;." "I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassidy, a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, noted that because of the recommended hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth, "we have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The vaccine is safe. It has been established," Cassidy said. "This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel of experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations, is set to meet next month. The draft &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-11-14-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt; for the Dec. 4-5 meeting includes discussions of the hepatitis B vaccine, and the meeting could entail votes on recommendations. In September, the panel &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-covid-19-hepatitis-b-vaccines/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;voted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to table a vote on whether to change the pediatric vaccine schedule for hepatitis B to a later date. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassidy has previously weighed in on the panel. In June, the Louisiana Republican called for a postponement of the vaccine meeting after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was "retiring" all 17 members of the panel, before replacing the committee members with his own picks. And in August, Cassidy likewise called for the panel to postpone its September vaccine advisory committee meeting amid a slew of departures from the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves represented breaks with Kennedy, who was confirmed as the nation's top health official only after winning support from Cassidy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee after he had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he had raised about vaccines. But Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing "serious commitments" he said he'd received from the administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by Brennan whether he regrets his vote to confirm Kennedy, Cassidy said "every reporter asks me that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You live life forward," Cassidy added. "Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question."&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The race to develop the next generation of weight loss drugs has taken an interesting new turn. In recent research, Eli Lilly’s experimental treatment eloralintide helped people lose a substantial amount of weight—without needing to use the same approach as existing popular medications like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month in The Lancet, Eli Lilly researchers and others &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)02155-5/abstract"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; the latest phase II trial results of eloralintide. Over a 48-week span, people taking eloralintide lost up to 20% of their baseline body weight, well above the average weight loss experienced by those on placebo. Eloralintide’s early success so far is all the more notable because it isn’t a GLP-1 drug.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A different mechanism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eloralintide mimics the hormone amylin. Our pancreas naturally releases amylin alongside insulin into the bloodstream in response to eating food. Once released, amylin helps tell our body that it’s full, tamps down our appetite, and slows the passage of food through our digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most effective weight loss drugs today, such as semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy), are long-acting mimics of the hormone GLP-1. Like GLP-1, amylin plays a part in regulating our hunger and blood sugar control. The two hormones even share some overlap in how they affect the body to carry out these functions. But they also have some key distinctions, and that’s made amylin a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8735818/"&gt;promising new target&lt;/a&gt; for obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There is an existing amylin-based drug, pramlintide, which was first &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/history/symlin.html"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; two decades ago as a treatment for diabetes. But it’s the newest amylin analogues in development, like eloralintide, that have really excited scientists. These experimental drugs are designed to last much longer in the body than natural amylin, ideally boosting the hormone’s effects to help people lose weight and control their blood sugar. Much like semaglutide, eloralintide is intended to be taken once a week via subcutaneous injection.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Early promise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eli Lilly’s phase II trial involved 263 participants without type 2 diabetes who had obesity (a body mass index over 30) or who were overweight (a BMI over 27) with weight-related health conditions. They were randomly assigned to either receive a placebo or varying doses of eloralintide. Some were given the same dosage of the drug throughout the study, while others were given gradually escalating dosages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People on eloralintide, no matter the dosing strategy, saw greater improvements in weight loss over 48 weeks on average compared to the placebo group, the study showed. People taking the highest weekly dose, nine milligrams, saw the best results, an average 20% weight loss during the study, as did people who steadily increased their dose from six to nine milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It also appeared to be safe and generally well-tolerated. The adverse events typically associated with the drug were gastrointestinal, similar to the known side effects of GLP-1 therapy. The most common adverse event was nausea, with about a third of people on the highest dose reporting the symptom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eloralintide produced clinically meaningful, dose-dependent reductions in bodyweight over 48 weeks and was generally well tolerated, supporting eloralintide’s potential use for obesity treatment,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does this mean for the future of weight loss?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;GLP-1s have greatly changed the field of obesity medicine in recent years. And though these drugs aren’t &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-simple-strategy-could-curb-one-of-semaglutides-worst-side-effects-2000631330"&gt;risk-free&lt;/a&gt; and can be highly expensive, they’ve already started to turn back the clock on obesity. For the first time in years, America’s obesity rate has &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx"&gt;noticeably declined&lt;/a&gt; as the use of these drugs has steadily climbed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are now &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-obesity-drugs-arent-even-here-yet-2000547636"&gt;plenty of obesity drugs&lt;/a&gt; in development, many of which are iterations of GLP-1. Other drugs are combining GLP-1 with other hunger-related hormones, including &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisks-experimental-obesity-drug-cagrisema-shows-blood-pressure-benefits-2025-11-06/"&gt;amylin&lt;/a&gt;. Eloralintide’s results are especially tantalizing, though, since the drug is only relying on amylin. That’s important because it may mean that eloralintide can eventually become an appealing alternative for people who haven’t responded to GLP-1 therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s far too early to be sure, especially without a study directly comparing these medications in a trial. But it’s worth noting that semaglutide only helped people lose about 15% of their body weight on average in clinical trials. Eli Lilly’s existing obesity drug tirzepatide, which pairs GLP-1 and the hormone GIP, has shown weight loss rates hovering around 20%.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These early findings will have to be verified by data from larger trials, of course. But if this research continues to show promise, eloralintide could open up a whole new area of obesity treatment.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Medically referred to as Takotsubo syndrome or broken heart syndrome, this condition involves a sudden, reversible weakening of the heart’s left or right ventricle and often closely mimics the symptoms of a heart attack. Although initially considered rare and largely benign, recent research shows that broken heart syndrome can lead to serious cardiovascular complications if it is not recognised and appropriately managed. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9821117/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; highlights how stress hormones, hormone levels, and the brain-heart connection create measurable effects on cardiac function and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why does stress affect the heart so strongly?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research indicates that Takotsubo syndrome is frequently triggered by a sudden surge of stress hormones, which temporarily stun the heart muscle and impair its ability to pump efficiently. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the release of catecholamines are central features of this response. Other contributing factors include reduced oestrogen levels, particularly in post-menopausal women, altered brain-heart communication, and inflammatory processes involving cardiac immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This intricate interaction between neurological, hormonal, and cardiovascular systems explains why both emotional and physical stressors can precipitate sudden ventricular dysfunction. Takotsubo syndrome demonstrates that the heart is sensitive not only to physical exertion but also to intense psychological stress, making emotional well-being a crucial factor in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Silent Heart Attack Symptoms Women Often Miss | Spot the Warning Before It’s Too Late | Dr Rajeev Agrawal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surges of stress hormones can temporarily weaken heart muscle.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catecholamine release and sympathetic activation are central triggers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced oestrogen and inflammatory responses increase vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emotional and physical stressors can both precipitate the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How do doctors diagnose broken heart syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms of Takotsubo syndrome are often indistinguishable from those of a heart attack, including severe chest pain, shortness of breath, and changes in the electrocardiogram or elevated cardiac enzymes. However, patients typically do not have blocked coronary arteries on coronary angiography. Imaging techniques such as echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance can reveal the characteristic “apical ballooning” of the left ventricle, giving the condition its informal name of apical ballooning syndrome, highlighting how subtle clinical differences can significantly influence patient care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differentiating Takotsubo syndrome from acute coronary syndrome is essential because treatment approaches differ substantially. A recent illness, surgery, or intense emotional stress can raise suspicion for Takotsubo syndrome, guiding clinicians toward accurate diagnosis and appropriate management while avoiding unnecessary interventions, ultimately supporting safer outcomes for individuals experiencing severe stress-related cardiac events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Symptoms often mimic a heart attack, including chest pain and shortness of breath.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coronary arteries generally remain unobstructed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apical ballooning of the left ventricle is a hallmark feature on imaging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Accurate diagnosis ensures correct and effective management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the hidden risks of broken heart syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many patients recover fully, Takotsubo syndrome is not entirely harmless. Complications can include heart failure, cardiogenic shock, irregular heart rhythms, and, in rare cases, left ventricular rupture. Early complications occur in approximately twenty per cent of patients, and mortality rates can approach those seen in acute coronary syndrome. Women, especially those who are post-menopausal, are disproportionately affected, while physical stressors such as surgery or severe illness are nearly as common as emotional triggers. The wide spectrum of potential complications underscores the importance of recognising Takotsubo syndrome as a serious cardiovascular condition rather than a symbolic or purely emotional response. These serious complications highlight the need for early diagnosis, cardiac monitoring, and awareness of risk factors such as stress triggers, hormonal changes, underlying heart disease, and immune responses, which can influence prognosis, recovery time, and long-term cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Takotsubo syndrome can lead to heart failure, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, and rare ventricular rupture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early complications occur in about twenty per cent of patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women, particularly post-menopausal, are most at risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical stress can trigger the condition as frequently as emotional events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is broken heart syndrome managed and treated?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Management of Takotsubo syndrome primarily involves acute monitoring of cardiac function and treatment of any heart failure symptoms. Physicians may prescribe beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers based on the patient’s cardiac status and existing comorbidities. Because overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system is a central mechanism, treatment aims to support recovery while limiting additional stress on the heart. Long-term strategies often include stress-reduction techniques, lifestyle adjustments, and follow-up imaging to ensure that ventricular function returns to normal. Continued research into molecular mechanisms may allow for more targeted and precise therapies in the future, improving both recovery and prognosis for affected patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acute care includes careful monitoring and symptom management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can support heart recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress-reduction strategies and lifestyle modifications are important for long-term health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow-up imaging confirms full recovery of ventricular function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What remains unknown about broken heart syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite advances, many questions about Takotsubo syndrome remain unanswered. The precise interactions of the brain-heart axis, individual genetic susceptibility, and the reasons for recurrence are still under investigation. Some patients continue to experience persistent cardiac symptoms even after apparent recovery. Interestingly, Takotsubo syndrome can occasionally occur after intensely positive emotional events, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “happy heart syndrome.” Ongoing research into inflammation, microvascular function, and molecular biomarkers may ultimately allow clinicians to predict susceptibility, anticipate complications, and develop interventions that are tailored to the unique pathways involved in this complex condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice.

			&lt;p&gt;A study presented at the American Heart Association's scientific meetings has raised concerns about melatonin, one of Britain's most commonly prescribed sleep  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hiv" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73049" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;aids&lt;/a&gt;. The findings suggest that long-term users face a higher risk of heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the preliminary data demands careful scrutiny before the alarm is sounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/melatonin-15404"&gt;Melatonin&lt;/a&gt; has been prescribed in the UK for nearly two decades, with 2.5 million prescriptions issued in England &lt;a href="https://openprescribing.net/chemical/0401010AD/"&gt;last year alone&lt;/a&gt;. The drug is a synthetic version of the hormone naturally produced in the brain – the so-called "hormone of darkness" that regulates our sleep–wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-used-to-sleep-twice-every-night-heres-why-it-vanished"&gt;Humans Used to Sleep Twice Every Night. Here's Why It Vanished.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, it's been &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/melatonin/who-can-and-cannot-take-melatonin/"&gt;considered safe&lt;/a&gt; for treating short-term sleep problems in adults and, under specialist supervision, for children with learning disabilities or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published only as a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circ.152.suppl_3.4371606"&gt;brief summary&lt;/a&gt;, analyzed electronic health records of roughly 130,000 adults with sleep difficulties over five years – half of whom took melatonin and half of whom didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who took melatonin for at least a year were roughly three times more likely to be hospitalized with heart failure than non-users (19 percent of people who took melatonin versus 6.6 percent of people who did not).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term users also faced higher rates of heart failure diagnosis and death from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers attempted to balance their comparison by matching melatonin users with non-users across 40 factors, including age, health conditions and medications. Yet the study found only an association, not causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction matters. Correlation doesn't prove that melatonin caused heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devil, as ever, lives in the missing details. Only a 300-word summary of the study exists so far, meaning crucial information – melatonin dosage, insomnia severity, lifestyle factors – remains unreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's methodology raises questions. It relied on electronic medical records rather than direct patient follow-up or interviews, which can leave gaps in the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research drew from TriNetX Global Research Network, a large international database. But healthcare practices and record-keeping vary wildly between hospitals and nations, potentially skewing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, melatonin requires a prescription for specific conditions. But in the US, it's sold over the counter – purchases that are often not documented in medical records. This means some people categorized as non-users may actually have been taking melatonin, muddying the comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The missing piece of the puzzle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even assuming both groups were correctly identified and matched, a key question lingers: why did one group receive melatonin while the other didn't?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps those prescribed the drug suffered more severe or disruptive sleep problems – symptoms that might reflect underlying health issues, including heart problems. If so, melatonin might simply be a marker of existing risk rather than the cause of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.70107"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; in heart failure patients suggested melatonin may actually protect heart health by improving psychological wellbeing and heart function. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ehf2.12829"&gt;Other research indicated&lt;/a&gt; it could ease symptoms in people with heart failure and serve as a safe complementary therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the study exists only as an abstract, it hasn't undergone  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/science-peer-review" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73086" data-postid="180949" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;peer review&lt;/a&gt;. And information on the study's methods and results remains limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings are noteworthy and raise legitimate questions about the long-term risks of using this supplement, they're far from conclusive. Further studies are needed to determine whether prolonged melatonin use affects heart health, and if so, how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors face a familiar balancing act: weighing treatment benefits against potential risks. Poor sleep doesn't just affect the heart; it's linked to &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/sleep-disorders/sleep-and-heart-health#:%7E:text=Sleep%20disorders%20such%20as%20insomnia%2C%20apnea%2C%20narcolepsy%20and,linked%20to%20a%20higher%20risk%20of%20cardiovascular%20diseases."&gt;problems&lt;/a&gt; with metabolism, mental health and the immune system, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors typically start with &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-wellbeing-tips/how-to-fall-asleep-faster-and-sleep-better/"&gt;lifestyle changes, better sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; and talk therapy. But when these fail to improve sleep quality, short-term medication may be necessary to restore healthy patterns and prevent further health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The melatonin story isn't over. It's just beginning. Until fuller evidence emerges, panic seems premature.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/269131/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Penn-led team has revealed how hydralazine, one of the world's oldest blood pressure drugs and a mainstay treatment for preeclampsia, works at the molecular level. In doing so, they made a surprising discovery—it can also halt the growth of aggressive brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         
										    


                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Over the last 70 years, hydralazine has been an indispensable tool in medicine—a front-line defense against life-threatening &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/high+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, especially during pregnancy. But despite its essential role, a fundamental mystery has persisted: No one knows its "mechanism of action"—essentially how it works at a molecular level, which allows for improved efficacy, safety, and what it can treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hydralazine is one of the earliest vasodilators ever developed, and it's still a first-line treatment for preeclampsia—a hypertensive disorder that accounts for 5%–15% of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/maternal+deaths/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;maternal deaths&lt;/a&gt; worldwide," says Kyosuke Shishikura, a physician-scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. "It came from a 'pre-target' era of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug+discovery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug discovery&lt;/a&gt;, when researchers relied on what they saw in patients first and only later tried to explain the biology behind it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Shishikura, his postdoctoral adviser at Penn Megan Matthews, and collaborators have solved this long-standing puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their paper &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx7687" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;, the team uncovered the method of action of hydralazine, and in doing so, revealed an unexpected biological link between hypertensive disorders and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The findings highlight how long-established treatments can reveal new therapeutic potential and could help in the design of safer, more effective drugs for both maternal health and brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Preeclampsia has affected generations of women in my own family and continues to disproportionately impact Black mothers in the United States," Matthews says. "Understanding how hydralazine works at the molecular level offers a path toward safer, more selective treatments for pregnancy-related hypertension—potentially improving outcomes for patients who are at greatest risk."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Hydralazine blocks an oxygen-sensing enzyme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that hydralazine blocks an oxygen-sensing enzyme called 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (ADO)—a molecular switch that tells blood vessels when to tighten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"ADO is like an alarm bell that rings the moment oxygen starts to fall," Matthews says. "Most systems in the body take time; they have to copy DNA, make RNA, and build new proteins. ADO skips all that. It flips a biochemical switch in seconds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydralazine acts by binding to and blocking ADO, which means it effectively "mutes" that oxygen alarm. Once the enzyme was silenced, the signaling proteins it normally degrades—called regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS)—remained stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buildup of RGS proteins, says Shishikura, tells the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; to stop constricting, effectively overriding the "squeeze" signal. This reduces intracellular calcium levels, which he calls the "master regulator of vascular tension." As calcium levels fall, the smooth muscles in blood vessel walls relax, causing vasodilation and a drop in blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From preeclampsia to brain cancer: A common target&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this study, cancer researchers and clinicians had begun to suspect that ADO was important in glioblastoma, where tumors often have to survive in pockets of very low oxygen, Shishikura explains. Elevated levels of ADO and its metabolic products had been linked with more aggressive disease, suggesting that shutting this enzyme down could be a powerful strategy, but no one had a good inhibitor to test that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see if hydralazine was a contender, Shishikura worked closely with structural biochemists at the University of Texas, who used X-ray crystallography, a high-resolution imaging technique, to visualize hydralazine bound to ADO's metal center, and with neuroscientists at the University of Florida, who tested the drug's effects in brain cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that the ADO pathway that regulates vascular contraction also helps &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor cells&lt;/a&gt; survive in low-oxygen environments. Unlike chemotherapy, which aims to kill all cells outright, hydralazine disrupted that oxygen-sensing loop, triggering cellular "senescence," or a dormant, non-dividing state in glioblastoma cells, effectively pausing growth without triggering further inflammation or resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unlocking the potential for other lifesaving treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the next step is to push the chemistry further by building new ADO inhibitors that are more tissue specific and better at crossing, or exploiting weak points in, the blood-brain barrier so they hit tumor tissue hard while sparing the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthews is also working to continue engineering the next generation of medical solutions by revealing the mechanics of clinically tested, long-known treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's rare that an old cardiovascular drug ends up teaching us something new about the brain," Matthews says, "but that's exactly what we're hoping to find more of—unusual links that could spell new solutions."&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Having a cat as a pet could potentially double a person's risk of schizophrenia-related conditions, according to an analysis of 17 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrist John McGrath and colleagues at the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research in Australia looked at papers published over the last 44 years in 11 countries, including the US and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their 2023 study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbad168"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; "a significant positive association between broadly defined cat ownership and an increased risk of schizophrenia-related disorders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a need for more high-quality studies in this field," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbad168"&gt;emphasize&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adorable-cat-helps-scientists-discover-new-virus-for-second-time"&gt;Adorable Cat Helps Scientists Discover New Virus (For Second Time)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea that cat ownership could be linked to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/schizophrenia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73022" data-postid="181568" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt; risk was proposed in a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/21.2.167"&gt;1995 study&lt;/a&gt;, with exposure to a parasite called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested as a cause. But the research so far has put forth mixed conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/128008-association-between-childhood-exposure-to-pet-cats-and-later-diagnosis-of-schizophrenia-a-case-control-study-in-saudi-arabia#!/"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that being around cats during childhood might make a person more likely to develop schizophrenia; however, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225320"&gt;not all research&lt;/a&gt; has found an association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149648" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC.gif" alt="Diagram of toxoplasmosis lifecycle" class="wp-image-149648 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC.gif 700w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC-642x519.gif 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC-513x415.gif 513w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/09/DiagramOfToxoplasmaLifeCycleFromCDC-600x485.gif 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149648" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Toxoplasmosis is only known to reproduce in cats (1), but can be spread to humans through intermediate hosts (2, 5, 7) as well.

Meanwhile, researchers keep finding more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mind-altering-parasite-may-make-infected-people-more-attractive-study-suggests"&gt;strange effects that infections may have&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside our bodies, &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; can infiltrate the central nervous system and influence neurotransmitters. The parasite has been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-parasite-has-been-linked-to-an-increased-risk-of-rage-disorder"&gt;linked to personality changes&lt;/a&gt;, the emergence of psychotic symptoms, and some neurological disorders, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/50-year-old-theory-on-schizophrenias-voices-confirmed-by-recent-study"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a link doesn't prove &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; causes these changes or that the parasite was passed on to a human from a cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147484" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture.jpg" alt="Cat lying in kitty litter box" class="wp-image-147484 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture-514x415.jpg 514w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/FuzzyGreyKittenLyingInKittyLitterBoxNextToHouseFurniture-600x484.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147484" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cat feces could be the source of toxoplasmosis. &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-cat-laying-in-a-bowl-on-the-floor-4ZelmqpEcOg"&gt;frosted_vulpes_ferrilata/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After adjusting for covariates, we found that individuals exposed to cats had approximately twice the odds of developing schizophrenia," the Australian team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/schbul/sbad168"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some important things to keep in mind here, like the fact that 15 of the 17 studies were case-control studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of research can't show cause and effect, and it often doesn't account for factors that may have affected both the exposure and the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also highlight the low quality of a number of the examined studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results were inconsistent across studies, but those of higher quality suggested that associations in unadjusted models might have been due to factors that could have influenced the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0225320"&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt; no significant association between owning a cat before age 13 and later developing schizophrenia, but it did identify a significant link when narrowing down cat ownership to a specific period (ages 9 to 12). This inconsistency suggests that the critical window for cat exposure is not well defined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996413001436?via=ihub"&gt;study in the US&lt;/a&gt;, which involved 354 psychology students, didn't find a connection between owning a cat and schizotypy scores.

For example, in Agwu’s state of Maryland, cases are at “four to five times what they saw this time last year,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/88750" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Matthew Thomas" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://directory.hsc.wvu.edu/Profile/88750" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;Dr. Matthew Thomas&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at WVU Medicine Golisano Children’s in West Virginia, said spikes typically happen in cycles. “Some years you’ll see a lot of cases, like we’re seeing this year, and then it kind of fades away, where you don’t hear about it for a while,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cases higher than normal, it’s important to know the signs of the virus and what to do if you (or your kids) get sick. Here’s what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the name suggests, symptoms include blisters on the hands, feet and mouth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth is a virus within the family of enteroviruses, explained &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jennifer-duchon" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Jennifer Duchon" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jennifer-duchon" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Duchon&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor in the divisions of pediatric infectious disease and newborn medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enteroviruses can present with a range of symptoms. In the case of hand, foot and mouth, “people can have symptoms like a common cold,” according to Thomas. This includes a fever, Agwu added, in addition to respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But then a common feature is that they will have a rash, typically on the hands and feet, as well as ulcers or blisters within the mouth,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blisters in the mouth are generally at the back of the throat and are often really painful, according to Duchon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the hands and feet, the rash may appear as little red bumps. “Those show up a couple days after the fever,” Agwu noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people’s hands will start to peel when the rash starts to go away, their feet will start to peel after the rash goes away,” Duchon said. “In really dramatic cases, sometimes your fingernails can fall off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jill Lehmann Photography via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jill Lehmann Photography via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease can cause blister-like bumps.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The disease spreads through respiratory droplets and fecal matter and can live on surfaces.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hand, foot and mouth disease is “super contagious,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It spreads through respiratory droplets that go out in the air when someone coughs or sneezes, according to Thomas. It can also spread via the fluid from the blisters or via infected surfaces. So if a child who has the virus drools on toys at daycare, other kids could get sick from those toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also spread in stool, so particularly for our infants who are not yet potty trained, someone who’s changing diapers is often putting themselves at risk,” Thomas said. For parents or caretakers changing dirty diapers, good hand hygiene is particularly important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most children and adults recover easily at home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the virus certainly can be gruesome, and often painful, most people do recover at home with the help of symptomatic care such as fever-reducing medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no specific medications for hand, foot and mouth, and since it’s a viral illness, “no antibiotics are going to get rid of it,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your children do get sick, you should “try to avoid spreading it to anyone else,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who is sick with hand, foot and mouth should isolate from others so they don’t pass on the virus, while also hydrating and eating enough nutrients. The virus tends to last for about a week in most people, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having more severe symptoms, like if you’re having a lot of ulcers in your mouth, it may take up to 10 to 14 days to resolve fully,” Thomas added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people require additional care, though. If you aren’t able to hydrate, or keep your sick child hydrated, you should seek medical care, Thomas noted. The same is true if whoever is sick isn’t able to eat enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duchon added, “If you’ve had hand, foot and mouth and afterwards, or towards the end of the illness, you’re feeling really, really tired or having trouble breathing, those are things that are really serious to look for that can mean that the heart has been affected. That’s a very rare but serious complication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand-washing is a good way to protect yourself from catching this virus.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of things you can do to keep yourself from getting sick with hand, foot and mouth and other viruses that are currently circulating such as the common cold and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/coronavirus" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="COVID-19" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69137e92e4b0c374cf511d14" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/news/topic/coronavirus" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way to prevent it is going to be always the same thing — washing hands ... if you’re touching something that’s problematic, like stool or what have you, making sure you’re doubling down on using good hand hygiene,” Agwu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re out and about, a “good alcohol-based hand sanitizer” is a fine option, too, but hand-washing with soap and water is ideal, Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also helpful to avoid touching your face as much as you can, Agwu noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden campaign-cta"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Power&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Truth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join HuffPost members who keep fearless, inclusive journalism alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

In 1855, James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA330&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA330&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false"}' href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MVIwAAAAIAAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA330&amp;amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Magazine&lt;/em&gt; that these wine “tears” or “legs” result from the difference in surface tension between alcohol and water. “This fact affords an explanation of several very curious motions,” Thomson wrote. Little did he realize that the same effect, later named the Marangoni effect, might also shape how embryos develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In March, a group of biophysicists in France &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-025-02802-2" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Marangoni effect is responsible for the pivotal moment when a homogeneous blob of cells elongates and develops a head-and-tail axis — the first defining features of the organism it will become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The finding is part of a trend that defies the norm in biology. Typically, biologists try to characterize growth, development, and other biological processes as the result of chemical cues triggered by genetic instructions. But that picture has often seemed incomplete. Researchers now increasingly appreciate the role of mechanical forces in biology: forces that push and pull tissues in response to their material properties, steering growth and development in ways that genes cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Modern imaging and measurement techniques have opened scientists’ eyes to these forces by flooding the field with data that invites mechanical interpretations. “What has changed over the past decades is really the possibility to watch what happens live, and to see the mechanics in terms of cell movement, cell rearrangement, tissue growth,” said &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/member/pierre-francois-lenne/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/member/pierre-francois-lenne/"}' href="https://www.ibdm.univ-amu.fr/member/pierre-francois-lenne/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pierre-François Lenne&lt;/a&gt; of Aix Marseille University, one of the researchers behind the recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The shift toward mechanical explanations has revived interest in pre-genetic models of biology. For example, in 1917 the Scottish biologist, mathematician, and classics scholar D’Arcy Thompson published &lt;em&gt;On Growth and Form&lt;/em&gt;, which highlighted similarities between the shapes found among living organisms and those that emerge in nonliving matter. Thompson wrote the book as an antidote to what he thought was an excessive tendency to explain everything in terms of Darwinian natural selection. His thesis—that physics, too, shapes us—is coming back into vogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-fkZDUs kHRAYC asset-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="CaptionWrapper-jYrTxZ byeLF caption AssetEmbedCaption-fyuOdR eXMqGf asset-embed__caption standard" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE CaptionText-brNLzD deqABF imSbFE fGraOh caption__text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time-lapse movie of a gastruloid developing a head-to-tail axis.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;There's fresh hope for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mysterious-form-of-vision-loss-may-brew-inside-the-gut-scientists-say"&gt;early detection&lt;/a&gt; and new treatments of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma"&gt;glaucoma&lt;/a&gt;, a group of eye diseases that have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-eye-test-can-detect-glaucoma-4-years-before-current-tests"&gt;devastating effects on vision&lt;/a&gt; – and for which there is currently no cure. A new study has identified two natural molecules that play an important role in these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agmatine"&gt;agmatine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiamine"&gt;thiamine&lt;/a&gt; (also known as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="181436" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B1), and their role in protecting against glaucoma was discovered by researchers led by a team from the University of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists suggest that agmatine and thiamine could be used as biomarkers for earlier detection of glaucoma, allowing doctors to put preventative measures in place at an earlier stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/space-can-hurt-your-vision-and-now-we-can-predict-the-damage"&gt;Space Can Hurt Your Vision, And Now We Can Predict The Damage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In several cases, people do not find out they have glaucoma until they are older and their eye pressure is elevated," &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/mizzou-researcher-discovers-natural-molecules-that-may-help-glaucoma-patients/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; ophthalmology researcher Pawan Singh, from the University of Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The molecules could also help with new treatments: boosting the levels of agmatine and thiamine in mice was shown to reduce inflammation in the retina, protect the retinal ganglion nerve cells (RGCs) that are typically damaged by glaucoma, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-eye-exercises-improve-your-vision-an-expert-reveals-the-truth"&gt;improve the vision&lt;/a&gt; of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined a fluid in the eye called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_humour"&gt;aqueous humor&lt;/a&gt; in 19 glaucoma patients and 10 healthy people, testing for 135 different &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite"&gt;metabolites&lt;/a&gt;. Of those, agmatine and thiamine were found to be especially reduced in people with glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Agmatine and thiamine could be potential immunomodulatory or neuroprotective drugs to treat or prevent neuroinflammatory damage to the retina during glaucoma," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.66.5.28"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_181439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181439" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels.jpg" alt="Chemical level chart" class="wp-image-181439 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/ChemicalLevels-600x462.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-181439" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked for chemical abnormalities in the eyes of people with glaucoma.

It's often, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glaucoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20372839"&gt;but not always&lt;/a&gt;, linked to elevated pressure in the eye – something that current treatments focus on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those treatments can only really slow down the disease though. Agmatine and thiamine show promise in stopping the progression of nerve cell &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-eyes-can-shed-light-on-underlying-health-problems"&gt;damage in the eye&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps reverse some of the damage that's already been done. However, a lot of further study is needed before this can be used to treat humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-181305" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-642x337.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final-600x315.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/health-newsletter-subscribe-promo-final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our long-term goal is to see if doctors could one day do a simple blood test to check for these biomarkers," &lt;a href="https://showme.missouri.edu/2025/mizzou-researcher-discovers-natural-molecules-that-may-help-glaucoma-patients/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can, hopefully they will be able to catch the disease much earlier, before vision loss occurs, so patients can receive treatment sooner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.66.5.28"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that ADHD involves differences in how emotional and cognitive brain circuits are physically wired during development. Although these differences are subtle, they could play a role in shaping the severity of symptoms across childhood and adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD has increasingly been conceptualized as a disorder that affects the brain’s connectivity. Many studies have focused on the brain’s outer cortical regions, such as the frontal lobes, which are involved in attention and executive function. However, less is known about how deeper brain structures, like those in the limbic system, develop in children with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limbic system helps regulate emotion and integrates emotional signals with cognitive processes. It is also implicated in behavioral regulation, impulse control, and mood—all areas where people with ADHD often experience difficulties. Emotional dysregulation is especially common in ADHD and can affect quality of life. Given the limbic system’s role in emotion and behavior, the researchers aimed to better understand how its white matter—bundles of nerve fibers that connect brain regions—develops in youth with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longitudinal brain imaging research allows scientists to examine how brain structures change over time. By focusing on the limbic system and using more advanced imaging techniques than in past research, the authors of this study hoped to uncover developmental patterns that may help explain why some symptoms of ADHD persist or worsen during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most research on ADHD brain development has focused on the outer regions of the brain, especially the frontal and striatal areas linked to attention and control,” said study author Michael Connaughton of the Department of Psychiatry at Trinity College Dublin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to look deeper – literally – into the limbic system, the brain’s emotional core that connects feeling, motivation, and focus. These regions have been difficult to study because of their complexity and location, but new MRI analysis techniques now let us see them with much finer detail. That opened the door to an important question: how do emotion-related brain pathways mature in ADHD as children move through adolescence?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed brain imaging data from 169 children and adolescents between the ages of 9 and 14. Among them, 72 had been diagnosed with ADHD, while 97 served as a comparison group without the disorder. Each participant underwent advanced diffusion MRI scans at three different time points spaced about 18 months apart. This approach allowed researchers to track changes in brain white matter over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A key strength of this study was that ADHD was confirmed at multiple time points, showing that participants met diagnostic criteria both early and later in development,” Connaughton noted. “This repeated confirmation is crucial for developmental research – it ensures we’re capturing stable features of ADHD rather than temporary fluctuations that can occur as children grow and symptoms change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used an advanced brain imaging technique called diffusion kurtosis imaging to examine the structure of white matter in the brain. This method tracks how water molecules move through brain tissue. In healthy white matter, which consists of tightly packed, insulated nerve fibers, water tends to move in a highly organized way. When the structure is less orderly, water movement becomes more random.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific measurement, called kurtosis anisotropy, captures this level of organization. Higher kurtosis anisotropy values indicate that the white matter fibers are well-organized and likely well-myelinated, meaning they are coated with a protective layer that helps electrical signals travel efficiently. Lower values suggest that the white matter may be less developed or less efficient at supporting fast communication between brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on five major white matter tracts in the limbic system, including the cingulum bundle, which connects regions involved in both cognition and emotion. They also constructed brain network models to assess how different parts of the limbic system were interconnected in each participant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to the control group, the children with ADHD showed lower kurtosis anisotropy in both the left and right cingulum bundles. These reductions were present across all three time points, suggesting that the white matter differences were not due to temporary fluctuations but instead reflected a stable, early-emerging feature of ADHD. The pattern of white matter development followed a typical trajectory over time, but those with ADHD started out at a lower baseline and did not catch up to their peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Individuals with ADHD showed stable reductions in limbic system white matter microstructural organisation, specifically lower kurtosis anisotropy in the bilateral cingulum bundle, across childhood and adolescence,” Connaughton told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the overall number and efficiency of connections within the limbic system did not significantly differ between the ADHD and control groups when considered as a whole. However, when the researchers looked at symptom severity within the ADHD group, a clearer picture emerged. Children and adolescents with more severe ADHD symptoms tended to have lower network density and reduced routing efficiency in their limbic system connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What stood out most was that connectivity within the limbic system network predicted symptom severity rather than diagnosis,” Connaughton said. “This reinforces the view of ADHD as a dimensional condition, existing along a continuum rather than as a categorical divide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between limbic system connectivity and symptom severity was not explained by differences in the cingulum bundle, suggesting that both local microstructure and broader network organization may contribute to ADHD symptoms in distinct ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences observed in the study were relatively small in size, but they were consistent. “They aren’t large enough for clinical prediction, but in neurodevelopment, small differences across interconnected systems can still influence symptom severity and presentation,” Connaughton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the findings indicate that ADHD involves early, stable disruptions in limbic white matter development, particularly within the cingulum, and that reductions in white matter interconnecting limbic regions become more pronounced in individuals with more severe ADHD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than pointing to a single brain abnormality, the results support the idea that ADHD involves distributed, small-scale differences across multiple systems. These differences may arise early in life and contribute to how symptoms unfold over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results don’t point to a single ‘ADHD biomarker,'” Connaughton said. “They reflect group- level trends, not diagnostic markers, and should be seen as part of a larger developmental picture that combines genetics, environment, and experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers important insights but also has some limitations. One issue is that the limbic system does not have a universally agreed-upon anatomical definition. Different studies may include or exclude certain regions, which can complicate comparisons across research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The age range studied was also relatively narrow, focusing on the transition from late childhood into early adolescence. Some individuals with ADHD may show delayed brain development that catches up later in adolescence or early adulthood. Extending the research to cover a wider age range could help clarify whether the differences observed here persist, worsen, or diminish over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We aim to track these developmental changes across the lifespan, extending our work into late adolescence and early adulthood when brain connectivity continues to evolve,” Connaughton explained. “By following individuals over longer periods and integrating imaging with genetic and behavioural data, we can begin to see how early brain differences unfold, stabilize, or adapt over time. The goal is to build a lifespan model of ADHD that helps both patients and clinicians understand why symptoms persist or remit across life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.09.022" target="_blank"&gt;Limbic System White Matter in Children and Adolescents with ADHD: A Longitudinal Diffusion MRI Analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Michael Connaughton, Alexander Leemans, Timothy J.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;While companies like Elon Musk’s Neuralink are hard at work on brain-computer interfaces that require surgery to cut open the skull and insert a complex array of wires into a person’s head, a team of researchers at MIT have been researching a wireless electronic brain implant that they say could provide a non-invasive alternative that makes the technology far easier to access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;They describe the system, called Circulatronics, as more of a treatment platform than a one-off brain chip. Working with researchers from Wellesley College and Harvard University, the MIT team recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-025-02809-3" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;released a paper&lt;/a&gt; on the new technology, which they describe as an autonomous bioelectronic implant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://newatlas.com/brain/mit-injectable-brain-chips-treat-disease/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Atlas&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, the Circulatronics platform starts with an injectable swarm of sub-cellular sized wireless electronic devices, or “SWEDs,” which can travel into inflamed regions of the patient’s brain after being injected into the bloodstream. They do so by fusing with living immune cells, called monocytes, forming a sort of cellular cyborg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;After they’ve been injected, the SWEDs then follow the “natural trafficking” of the immune cells to &lt;a href="https://www.americanbrainfoundation.org/what-is-neuroinflammation/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sites of inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the brain, which play a significant role in many neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Once at the target area, the SWEDs embed in the inflamed part of the brain, where they deliver “electrical modulation” — basically tiny electrical shocks — in an effort to deliver signals that otherwise wouldn’t get through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In their paper, the researchers claim Circulatronics could be used in the treatment of Alzheimer’s, multiple sclerosis, strokes, brain tumors, spinal injuries, and more. The team says they’ve successfully implanted the experimental SWEDs in a rodent brain, which they could then control wirelessly to provide electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;If it works out in human patients, the researchers hope Circulatronics could expand treatment of brain regions which are typically expensive, difficult, and dangerous to treat with traditional surgery. (&lt;em&gt;New Atlas&lt;/em&gt; reports that Circulatronics will probably take another &lt;a href="https://orbit.mit.edu/launchpad/ideas/cahira-technologies" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;three years&lt;/a&gt; to even enter clinical trials.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The cool part, the study’s lead author Deblina Sarkar explains in a video, is that “this technology is not just confined to the brain, but could also be extended to other parts of the body in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

At the time of writing, this figure was on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of physical activity puts adults at greater risk of &lt;a href="/topic/cardiovascular-disease"&gt;cardiovascular diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as heart attacks and strokes, type 2 diabetes, dementia and &lt;a href="/topic/cancer"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; such as breast and colon, the organisation writes. But &lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://redirect.viglink.com?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41467-025-63475-2&amp;amp;articleId=b2863711&amp;amp;key=5b1a6400a3c0d931ed2037885e1a27a3"&gt;new research from the University of Sydney&lt;/a&gt; suggests a certain type of &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; could be more powerful in preventing these conditions than previously thought: vigorous-intensity activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new data found vigorous-intensity activity to be six times more effective at lowering your risk of cardiovascular disease than moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking, lead author Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis tells me. In other words, for every one minute of vigorous-intensity activity you do, you would need to do six minutes of a moderate-intensity activity to have the same impact on heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For diabetes, it’s nine times more effective, and for all-cause mortality and cancer it’s a little bit lower,” Professor Stamatakis adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term “vigorous-intensity activity” is relative – depending on factors such as your age and fitness level, it could mean anything from a swim or cycle to a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout. The telltale signs are; your heart is beating fast; you are breathing hard to the point you can’t speak in full sentences; you can’t maintain this intensity for more than a few minutes at a time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can reach this intensity a few times per week, you can reduce your risk of chronic illness, the University of Sydney’s study suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vigorous-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The signs of vigorous intensity will be very clear. For a non-athlete aged 30 and up who doesn’t do much exercise, they shouldn’t be able to maintain this intensity for more than two to three minutes without a break. It will be a significant effort, you will be getting out of breath and your heart will be pounding. You should be able to talk, but only say a few words at a time.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderate-intensity physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘You will feel slightly out of breath – you can talk and hold a discussion, but you can’t sing comfortably because your respiratory system is quite engaged. There is a certain level of exertion, but you can sustain this for many minutes or even hours.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Light physical activity is any very low-intensity activity where you are moving but your heart rate is barely raised, such as a slow walk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the science says &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation recommends adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity like brisk walking, 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity like faster running or HIIT, or an equivalent of both. These physical activity guidelines have been widely adopted by the likes of the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/physical-activity-guidelines-for-adults-aged-19-to-64/"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this new research, published in the Nature journal, challenges the implicit 2:1 benefit ratio of the two intensities, suggesting you might need less vigorous-intensity activity or more moderate-intensity activity than previously thought to achieve the same health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We make a lot of fuss about the intensity of physical activity in our research because, firstly, different intensities have different health effects, and secondly, the higher the intensity, the higher the health value usually is,” says Professor Stamatakis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His latest study used wearable data from 73,485 UK participants to assess the health impacts of light, moderate and vigorous activity against a selection of specific health outcomes; cardiovascular mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, type 2 diabetes and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 kcbSyT"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health outcome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amount of vigorous-intensity activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median equivalence in minutes to see the same response from moderate-intensity activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median equivalence in minutes to see the same response from light activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 2 diabetes incidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;9.4 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;94 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.8 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;72.5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major adverse cardiovascular events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.4 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;86.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;All-cause mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;52.7 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity related cancer mortality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3.5 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;156.2 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity related cancer incidence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 minute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.6 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;5.1 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious conclusion here is that a time-efficient exercise routine should hinge on vigorous-intensity activity. If you prefer moderate-intensity activities like brisk walking, you can use these to obtain similar health benefits, but the time commitment required for the same gains will be considerably greater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, no amount of light activity, like a slow walk, can replicate “some of the core physiological responses from vigorous-intensity activity”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it comes to light activity, some movement is better than none,” Professor Stamatakis explains. “Moving around instead of sitting down is good for metabolic disease and energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when it comes to functional capacity, and cardiorespiratory fitness in particular, you need intensity to challenge your physiology. Vigorous-intensity activity will force the heart to strengthen its muscle, improving its capacity to pump blood. Very few of these things happen with light intensity activity, even in large amounts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/exercise-intensity-heart-health-b2856019.html"&gt;The thing most people get wrong when exercising – and why it’s costing them results&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 lnqVrP"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/03/8/07/iStock-1097320204.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking or running uphill, or up stairs, can be a way to increase the intensity of an activity" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-314624"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Walking or running uphill, or up stairs, can be a way to increase the intensity of an activity&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to exercise for maximum health benefits, based on this research &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Compared to people who don’t do any vigorous-intensity activity as part of their day-to-day routines, introducing anything – even four to five minutes per day – seems to have some effect long term,” says Professor Stamatakis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This relates to another paper he co-authored earlier this year. The research found that five to 10 short daily bursts of vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (or VILPA), such as climbing the stairs or carrying heavy shopping, can significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and premature death in less active populations. These bouts of VILPA can be accrued through 60-second bursts of physically challenging activities during the day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to achieving lifelong benefits is to make these active behaviours into a habit, Professor Stamatakis asserts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not talking about doing it once a week or whenever you remember, we’re talking about a daily behaviour,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those currently living a sedentary lifestyle are the most likely to see significant benefits from introducing short bouts of vigorous-intensity activities into each day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone does no vigorous-intensity activity, very little moderate-intensity activity – let’s say 15 minutes or less – and a few hours of light activity per day, that’s a very sedentary individual,” Professor Stamatakis says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typically, they will do under 5,000 or 6,000 steps per day. A very sedentary non-bedridden person – someone who does no planned physical activity, just essential movements like going to the car to drive to work, going to the supermarket for food or going to the bathroom – will accumulate about 4,000 steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For such an individual, if they aim to incorporate seven short bursts of vigorous activity per day, or if you go by this study the equivalent is 63 minutes of moderate activity, they will lower their risk of health outcomes like cardiovascular diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/negative-health-effects-of-sitting-down-b2842653.html"&gt;From back pain to heart health – Experts reveal how to counter the negative effects of too much sitting down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 bAxvyM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/02/17/55/iStock-1912105812.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The most important factor in securing long-term health benefits is finding a type of exercise you can stick with" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-314625"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;The most important factor in securing long-term health benefits is finding a type of exercise you can stick with&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dealer’s choice, and why vigorous-intensity activity is not for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study is not to impose vigorous-intensity activity across all populations. Rather, it aims to provide people with more strings to their bow when creating an effective and sustainable exercise routine for fending off chronic illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are short on time, vigorous-intensity physical activity can help you maximise exercise efficiency, particularly if you use short bursts of challenging lifestyle activities like climbing the stairs and carrying heavy shopping. These acts can also familiarise you with the feeling of a workout, paving the way for more formal exercise later down the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this approach won’t work for everyone. Pushing people into a type of exercise they don’t enjoy can leave a “bad taste in their mouth”, souring their relationship with movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The higher the intensity, the more discomfort comes with it,” says Professor Stamatakis. “We know this discomfort is a reason why some people quit exercise – because they don’t enjoy it. This is especially true in the population we’re interested in, which is physically inactive people.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this is the case, moderate-intensity activity is a good alternative. You will have to devote more time to it – even more than previously thought, this latest study suggests – but it could be a more sustainable and enjoyable approach for certain people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If someone cannot do vigorous activity, or they can’t integrate it into their day-to-day routine for whatever reason, what is the point of prescribing and advocating vigorous intensity?” Professor Stamatakis asks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be that a very sedentary 60- or 70-year-old gentleman may enjoy going to the park with their grandchildren or going for a slow walk with a friend and chatting – that’s absolutely fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to be considerate and respectful towards people’s preferences; you have to acknowledge their circumstances and, considering everything, support them in the best possible way to integrate activity into their days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The point here is to give people as many options as possible, hoping that one of them will be the option they can stick with. It’s all about establishing habits – not doing things once a week or once a month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/polyphenols-benefits-and-anti-ageing-effects-b2831125.html"&gt;Experts say including more of this in your diet can help you live a longer, healthier life - and it’s not protein or fibre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQTWtmbDBJX3NYcUFjLUdCbzZjZ0JnRkgxMy1kTHI4b0dPc29wYVYzS3FadEtjX2hwMGJHemJoU0FsNldaRl9RcmNvbTEzVGczYjhFY2R6VWNmaUVBeHRvRU5iaHNZSEJmZ3VkOFhqb2pNalp0Vkdoc0h6aE9GUlJ6Ym5DRmpDZ0w5aGkwa3pfaXlkay0zWTBjTHFnMC02OVg3TGJvenQxbHBmc0E</guid></item><item><title>饮食不健康和久坐不动的生活方式是导致心脏病发作的主要原因-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-things-other-that-eating-unhealthy-and-a-sedentary-lifestyle-which-contribute-majorly-to-heart-attacks-in-most-people/articleshow/125362611.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart attacks continue to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide, despite advances made in medical treatments and technologies. To help prevent such lethal heart conditions, such as stroke, attack or cardiac arrest, cardiologists usually pay much attention to maintaining blood pressure, cholesterol, and other conventional risk factors within normal limits. According to Dr. Dimitry Yaranov, a well-respected heart transplant cardiologist, the key to preventing heart attacks deserves much greater dedication to fundamental life and holistic health principles. Following are the first things he would never do when it comes to preventing heart attacks, with respect to the management of hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Never neglect the cornerstone of heart health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Yaranov insists that the building blocks of heart health include so much more than just numbers of blood pressure and cholesterol. Among the cardinal rules he lives by is never to disregard key components such as quality sleep, stress management, clean air, and gut health. These are closely related to cardiovascular health and blood pressure. Poor sleep, for example, disrupts the normal nocturnal blood pressure dip, increasing the risk for hypertension and heart disease. Emotional and chronic stress causes inflammation and raises blood pressure, silently hurting the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;What Your Cholesterol Report Is Hiding — The Truth That Could Save Your Heart | Dr Vinayak Agarwal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, ignoring these factors for the sake of medication or isolated lab results does more harm than good. A comprehensive approach to sleep hygiene, mental wellbeing, and environmental quality becomes crucial in the prevention of heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid extreme or restrictive diets&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While managing hypertension and heart disease, nutrition plays an important role. Dr. Yaranov cautions against extreme diets, such as very high-protein or carnivore diets, which some might assume are heart-healthy merely because they reduce carbohydrate intake. These diets can elevate LDL cholesterol and provoke systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of artery blockage and cardiovascular events, even in young and otherwise fit individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, his approach advocates for balanced diets rich in nutrients, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Such diets not only help to regulate blood pressure but also reduce oxidative stress and support the gut microbiome, a vital, often overlooked player in cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Never push through chronic stress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is understandable when people today try to "push through" heavy schedules and emotional loads. According to Dr. Yaranov, this attitude is not good for heart health. Stress raises blood pressure temporarily, but frequently enough to cause chronic hypertension and inflammation-major risk factors for heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mindfulness, meditation, physical activity, and adequate rest are some of the effective stress management techniques that he should not miss out on in his heart attack prevention strategy. It is also important to say “no” when overwhelmed and set boundaries to reduce emotional overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Effect of gut microbiome&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emerging research is showing that many aspects of cardiovascular health, including blood pressure, are influenced by gut microbiome. Dr. Yaranov would never neglect gut health in planning heart attack prevention strategies. A diet high in fiber, fermented foods, and prebiotics helps maintain an appropriate gut flora balance to help modulate blood pressure and lower systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conversely, poor gut health could contribute to hypertension and vascular disease by promoting inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. It is thus important that digestive well-being be prioritized in holistic heart care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid unmonitored medication use&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While moderate consumption of alcohol may have some cardiovascular benefits, binge drinking-even occasionally-can result in subtle vascular damage and sharply raise blood pressure, increasing the risk for heart attacks. Dr. Yaranov says to avoid such patterns at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, unmonitored intake of medications or supplements that raise blood pressure can undermine heart health efforts. The communication between patients with hypertension and their health care providers should be open regarding all drugs taken by them, since certain key medications such as NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and some stimulants may raise blood pressure or lead to fluid retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Embracing holistic care&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end of it, Dr. Yaranov's guiding principle is to treat the patients and not to get better numbers on a blood pressure machine. To offer a personalised approach that includes balanced nutrition, lifestyle interventions and promoting sleep and emotional health, judicious use of medication and regular follow-up, all of which are essential for vascular health and heart function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAJBVV95cUxQUEdMcjJqMkIzbUYxd3pyUVNnZWNweWhsY08yZlFwZ3UySER1dVJPLVVpNGZSOUJ4eXFVZUZQblZJRUk0UE1sWnJSMDkxNmx6eEJBUFRyNG5jbl92aVlzYTdRZmh6TnkwMWhFVHBXS0FHZ3ljOEJLQjRIUm9iY01aeVB3Q2IxLWVKRVcwRmxvc1dlWVpsVUdaVlB0OUFaMFJyeHZMc3hBN29vWkZTLWFsQWNCNGEwZzd1QmJ5WnI3N2dSY19iZU1zbDdlTUxub2tsM1AzcnV6dW4xdWw4LTVZQl93T2FBM0kyd0FIRlJEa2tiakEwanZxdUFGRlRyY1dzUU5PNWJyWWVmeVpjZ1pObjRlNmpOSGphZmk2eWg4RE5TZ1hRbERocGh5NjlJckNo</guid></item><item><title>阿波罗德里内分泌学家解释印度食物中隐藏的糖：即使是idli或poha也是一个问题...... |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/apollo-delhi-endocrinologist-explains-hidden-sugars-in-indian-foods-even-idli-poha-are-problem-when-paired-with-ketchup-101763286808328.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/apollo-delhi-endocrinologist-explains-hidden-sugars-in-indian-foods-even-idli-poha-are-problem-when-paired-with-ketchup-101763286808328.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ever wondered why you're feeling slaky or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/feeling-tired-all-day-doctor-warns-it-can-be-a-sign-of-iron-deficiency-suggests-ways-to-boost-iron-levels-101762345266782.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="tired all the time"&gt;tired all the time&lt;/a&gt;?

But sugar is not just in dessert — it quietly hides in many of our everyday Indian foods. From breakfast dishes to snacks and drinks, hidden sugars can easily push your daily intake beyond healthy limits, leading to sudden sugar spikes and long-term risks like diabetes, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/shark-tanks-namita-thapar-48-shares-how-she-copes-with-perimenopause-weight-gain-i-work-out-6-days-a-week-101756099137642.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="weight gain"&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, and fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bhattacharya, many common foods we eat every day contain more sugar than we realise:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Breakfast items: “Popular choices like &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kokilaben-hospital-gastroenterologist-explains-how-your-morning-milk-tea-could-silently-harm-your-gut-and-liver-101761880109103.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="chai with sugar"&gt;chai with sugar&lt;/a&gt;, flavoured cornflakes, or sweetened yoghurt can cause you to start your day with 3–5 teaspoons of sugar. Even idli or poha become a problem when paired with ketchup or packaged chutneys that contain added sugar,” Dr Bhattacharya said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Snacks: “Packaged namkeens, biscuits, instant noodles, and bakery items like pav or buns often contain refined sugar to enhance flavour and shelf life,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Indian gravies: “Many restaurant-style curries and sauces — like butter chicken, paneer butter masala, or korma — use tomato ketchup, cream, or sweetened pastes that add hidden sugar,” he shared&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;⦿ Drinks: Soft drinks, bottled fruit juices, milkshakes, energy drinks, and even 'healthy' packaged lassi or flavoured milk can contain 5-8 teaspoons or 20-30 gm of sugar per serving, as per Dr Bhattacharya.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Street food: “Chaats, samosa chole, and pani puri often use sweet chutneys and syrups. Over time, these sugars add up and cause chronic calorie surplus that results in fat deposition and obesity,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/16/original/Gemini_Generated_Image_jynkdvjynkdvjynk_1763286924347.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Eating too much hidden sugar can cause your blood sugar to spike, increasing the risk of diabetes, belly fat, heart disease, and inflammation.

(Made using Gemini AI)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What hidden sugars do to your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consuming high amounts of hidden sugars can lead to a rapid rise in blood glucose levels, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/doctor-reveals-6-signs-you-might-have-insulin-resistance-increased-belly-fat-cravings-for-carbs-sugar-thirst-101754709377512.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="insulin resistance"&gt;insulin resistance &lt;/a&gt;and type 2 diabetes, and belly fat, heart disease, and inflammation. “Hidden sugars cause a rapid rise in blood glucose levels, followed by a sudden drop that leaves you tired and craving more sugar. Over time, this cycle increases the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Even if you’re not diabetic, excess sugar contributes to belly fat, heart disease, and inflammation,” Dr Bhattacharya said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to cut down on hidden sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Bhattacharya, you don’t have to give up your favourite foods — just make small, mindful changes. Here is what he suggested:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Read labels carefully: Packaged foods often list sugar under names like sucrose, glucose syrup, maltose, or dextrose. The shorter the ingredient list, the better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Limit sweetened beverages: Replace bottled drinks with fresh nimbu pani (lemon water), unsweetened coconut water, or &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/delhi-dietician-reveals-why-herbal-tea-is-better-than-chai-during-pollution-season-suggests-which-ones-work-the-best-101763018962797.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="herbal teas"&gt;herbal teas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Cook at home: When you prepare your own gravies, you can skip the ketchup or cream and use fresh tomato puree, yoghurt, or nuts for texture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;⦿ Balance your meals: Combine carb-heavy dishes like rice, poha, or chapati with fibre and protein—like vegetables, lentils, or paneer — to slow sugar absorption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="highlight"&gt;⦿ Watch portion sizes: Even traditional sweets can be enjoyed occasionally—just limit to small portions and eat them after a balanced meal, not on an empty stomach.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Bhattacharya concluded: “The key isn’t to stop enjoying Indian food — it’s to make it smarter. Choose fresh ingredients, &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/signalling-health-in-packaged-food-space-101756738619194.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="reduce packaged and restaurant meals"&gt;reduce packaged and restaurant meals&lt;/a&gt;, and be conscious of how sugar sneaks into your plate. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;When you take control of what goes into your food, you protect your energy levels, your blood sugar, and your long-term health — one mindful bite at a time.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

              &lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Gabi McCord paces her kitchen. Crayon drawings are pinned to the fridge, shelves are cluttered with picture frames, and little shoes sit on a rack near the door. She stirs together pancake mix, heavy cream, and a heaping spoonful of cinnamon. Then she puts bite-sized pieces on her baby's high chair tray and drizzles maple syrup on the stacks for the older two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a scene so ordinary it's hard to imagine how fragile it is. And how quickly a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-31-diagnosed-colon-cancer-despite-being-fit-and-healthy-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;diagnosis would shift everything&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I call Gabi, it's often in moments like this, with her kids giggling on the other side of the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go watch 'Paw Patrol' with your brother. I'm making us something to eat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;em&gt;Shhhh,&lt;/em&gt; babe. Mommy's on the phone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I love you, too."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabi's last few years have been a whirlwind — a surprise pregnancy, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bi-today-newsletter-cancer-diagnosis-healthcare-ai-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cancer at 35&lt;/a&gt;, treatment, recovery, motherhood, marriage, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cancer-made-me-a-better-manager-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;work&lt;/a&gt;, and an uncertain path forward.

          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I missed out on bonding with my son after he was born. There was a moment recently that I remember looking at him and bursting out in tears, like, 'You're my baby, You're mine,'" Gabi, now 37, said. "Cancer meant that certain things didn't quite register, and life was happening around me. I was sitting down in a cinema watching myself. Now I'm pressing the pause button and looking at each scene."&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer cases are rising for people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, derailing finances and future plans at a pivotal stage of life. Dozens of patients have told us they're navigating relationships, fertility decisions, early parenthood, and career growth alongside treatment. They're paying medical bills and for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/james-van-der-beek-colon-cancer-symptom-diagnosis-screening-shield-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;all the unexpected costs&lt;/a&gt; along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But young cancer doesn't just affect patients.

              &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Gabi was at a routine check-up near her Houston home when the gynecologist first mentioned that something looked off. The results of her 2023 &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/at-home-pap-smear-wand-approved-fda-teal-health-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;Pap smear&lt;/a&gt;, along with weeks of pelvic pain and spotting between periods, had raised concern for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a follow-up that spring, the doctor noticed changes to her cervix and paused mid-exam. Before they could do further diagnostics, she needed to take a pregnancy test.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The morning blurred after that. Gabi remembers stepping into a Walgreens as rain poured across the parking lot. She stood in the family planning aisle, whispering a prayer, and reached for an electronic test — the ones that spell out PREGNANT in big, unmistakable letters. It was an extra $3, but it felt worth the splurge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nine months after that positive test, Gabi and her husband, Johnathon Shufford, lived in a kind of suspended reality. She has three teenagers from a prior relationship, and this would be her third baby with Johnathon.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The couple &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-you-should-wait-to-have-a-baby-economy-tariffs-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;prepared a nursery&lt;/a&gt; for their youngest child, picked a name, and held on to hope — counting down the weeks until doctors could safely perform a biopsy to find out if she had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2023, they welcomed a healthy baby boy. He was barely 2 months old when Gabi had a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/abnormal-pap-smear" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cervical cone&lt;/a&gt;, a procedure that confirmed her diagnosis of stage 3C1 cervical cancer. He had just hit 4 months when she returned to the hospital for a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-need-hysterectomy-struggling-emotionally-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;radical hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt; and lymph node dissection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when things became real for Johnathon. He remembers shifting from newborn pediatrician visits to the oncology ward. "It's very scary when you think about losing your wife," he said. The daily nerves he had during Gabi's pregnancy grew into a crushing devastation that he tried to hide. "I didn't want her to see me down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, the couple clung to routines — grocery runs, laundry, baby bottles. Gabi would wake up early to drop off their daughter and older son at day care on her way to the office, where she worked in insurance sales. Johnathon would pick them up each afternoon and get them settled at home before his &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shift-workers-struggle-find-childcare-9-to-5-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;evening shift as a truck driver&lt;/a&gt;. Her two rounds of chemotherapy and six rounds of radiation were tucked into the family schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1763149921965" data-styles="breakout-width" data-embed-type="custom" data-script="https://tbimedia.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/bistudios/_00/dev_edit/graphics/2025/10/2025-10-YoungCancer-Modules/index.js" class="insider-raw-embed breakout" data-type="embed"&gt;&lt;figure data-chart="yc10"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
          
          
          
          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it grew harder to relish the sweet moments of normalcy, and costs were piling up. Numbers came one by one, and were rarely dramatic on their own:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$48 for each can of formula because breastfeeding during chemo wasn't safe;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$30-plus copays&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for each visit to the oncologist, OBGYN, or neurologist; $13 for each bottle of Advil; and $2.80 for each gallon of gas burned driving back and forth to the doctor. Each expense felt small until it wasn't — until the sum began to look like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/24-year-old-diagnosed-stage-3-colon-cancer-subtle-symptom-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;a diagnosis they couldn't afford to treat&lt;/a&gt;. Even with insurance, the medical bills totaled thousands and thousands of dollars. Gabi winced when she paid $60 for the occasional manicure to feel like herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those receipts mirror what researchers are documenting nationwide. Medical debt is a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/credit-score/medical-bankruptcies" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;top cause of bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.goodrx.com/healthcare-access/research" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; analysis with Business Insider found that working-age cancer patients can spend about $45,000 out-of-pocket in the first year of diagnosis, between treatment, lost wages,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insurance-fertility-ivf-costs-hsa-millennial-couple-infertility-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt; fertility care&lt;/a&gt;, and unexpected costs. It's the hidden math of survival: how even insured people like Gabi watch cancer quietly drain their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Many newly diagnosed cervical cancer patients are balancing motherhood alongside work and treatment, said Dr. Andrea Tufano-Sugarman, a gynecologic oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Cases are rising for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2025/2025-cancer-facts-and-figures-acs.pdf" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;women in their 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt;, she said, and "I try to brainstorm with my patients what they might need in terms of getting childcare, dinner, and the logistics of all that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Gabi, treatment was extracting its own tax. Beyond fatigue and nausea, she was going through &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/going-through-early-menopause-feels-lonely-2023-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;early menopause&lt;/a&gt;, and feeling hot all the time made it harder to hold her kids. She struggled to fall asleep at night, prepare meals, drive to the office, and manage the rhythm of the household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she developed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/father-peripheral-neuropathy-nerve-damage-condition-navigating-fatherhood-work-health-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;peripheral neuropathy &lt;/a&gt;in late 2024, a side effect of radiation that caused numbness and nerve damage, she could barely celebrate that her cancer scans were clear. She could no longer feel her legs, and doctors couldn't predict if the paralysis would be permanent. Johnathon carried his wife up and down the stairs of their second-floor rental apartment each time they went outside. She resigned from her insurance job soon after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever he had a question, Johnathon watched YouTube. He asked the search bar how to cook easy dinner recipes, properly fold a wheelchair, and style his toddlers' hair in the morning. He had quickly become the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/being-sole-breadwinner-family-important-lessons-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sole earner and primary parent&lt;/a&gt;, and his own mental health started to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When your spouse gets cancer, it's almost like you have it too," he said. "You may not have it physically, but mentally, if you truly love your spouse, there's going to be a lot of times that you feel really bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kids — who are now 1, 4, and 6 — are too little to understand cancer and the gravity of it all. That brings Gabi some relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;When I visited Gabi in late August, she had just started walking again. She joked about her swollen feet and one of the few shoes that fit — a pair of chunky New Balance sneakers. She pointed to the compression device she uses for her legs and the glittery hot-pink wheelchair folded in the corner of her bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we drove to get lunch through Houston's heat, the conversation turned to paperwork. Getting a blue &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/labor-shortage-unemployment-hiring-workers-with-disabilities-cap-report-2022-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;disability permit&lt;/a&gt; for her car has taken months and a stack of forms thicker than her medical file. She said she constantly has to prove to the government, insurance company, and strangers that she still needs it.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;"I style my hair and wear makeup and stuff, and I do it to feel good. But the flip side of that is that people seeing me don't believe me," Gabi sighed. That's part of why she still keeps her wheelchair folded in the trunk because "it's really hard when people can't see your disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he needed help the most, Johnathon said Candice Julien and Chineva Smith — Gabi's sister and cousin — were "angels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient isn't the only person that goes through this traumatic experience," Chineva said. "Hope was literally the size of a mustard seed, just pulling us through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candice, a 34-year-old federal employee in Maryland, flew cross-country twice a month to hold Gabi's hand and sent care packages when she couldn't be there in person. Her two children are elementary age, so she traded off days of remote work, PTO, and childcare with her husband, often flying their kids back and forth to Texas. She's in thousands of dollars of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-credit-card-gen-z-high-levels-debt-spending-points-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;credit card debt&lt;/a&gt; from travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chineva is a professor in Houston. The 37-year-old, who has two teenagers, spent hundreds of dollars on groceries, baby supplies, pajamas, and car seats to make sure her young niece and nephews were comfortable. A stack of diapers still sits in the backseat of her car, "just in case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout her treatment, Gabi said she had no idea how scared her loved ones felt. They laughed with her, prayed with her, picked up snacks from Target when they all grew tired of hospital food, and promised her everything would turn out all right. They privately worried it wouldn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five percent of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lessons-learned-end-of-life-planning-when-mother-died-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cancer caregivers&lt;/a&gt; developed poor mental health during their loved one's treatment and a third felt significant grief, a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10950200/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=""&gt;2024 survey&lt;/a&gt; of a few hundred caregivers found. They're at a high risk for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder — especially women, who shoulder most of the care load in the US. Paola Zambrana of the Caregiver Action Network emphasized that caregivers also navigate a loved one's treatment around limited PTO, complex finances, and parenting responsibilities, which is "a part of mental health that isn't really spoken about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm still not OK, and honestly, I don't think I ever will be," Candice said, adding, "Sometimes you just have to show up."&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image  breakout " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="drop-cap"&gt;Cancer has shifted everyone's plans for the future. Gabi's scans have been clear for nearly a year, though she worries about what recurrence would mean for her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her marriage has become strained; she and Johnathon started couples therapy this fall. The financial impact of cancer means they &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennial-first-time-homebuyers-real-estate-disappearing-losing-baby-boomers-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;can't afford the down payment&lt;/a&gt; on the house they've dreamed of and will spend a few more years renting. Gabi said that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-get-medical-bills-reduced-negotiate-challenge-payment-plan-2024-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;medical debt&lt;/a&gt; has also tanked her credit score. "Now we're having a lot of conversations," she said.

The couple feels like they're constantly getting new bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Gabi returned to an insurance sales job. She worries that she won't have enough energy for a 9-to-5, but she said she needs her own income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the chaos came a kind of clarity. If she couldn't control her body or her bank account, she could control what came next — and how she used her story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabi is pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Public Health, with a focus on &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/americans-struggle-afford-healthcare-medicaid-low-income-black-hispanic-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;health inequities&lt;/a&gt; that affect communities of color.

                  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Her sanctuary has become a garden-level room adorned with fairy lights and flowers. In this "room of peace," Gabi prays like she does in a pew on Sundays. She wraps herself in the bubblegum pink blanket she brought to every chemo appointment and updates the family calendar with holidays, birthdays, and playdates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every day, I get to wake up and hold my kids," she said. "I try not to dwell on the shit that could have happened, but I look at my baby and my family and my husband, and I see what it would have been like if they had to walk behind my casket."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family has their own ideas about moving forward. Chineva plans to write children's books about grief and has become diligent about her own &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/easy-at-home-colon-cancer-screening-tests-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;preventive health screenings&lt;/a&gt;. Candice hopes to live closer to her sister someday and take her on a beach vacation. Johnathon looks forward to supporting his kids' hobbies as they grow. They still ask for cinnamon pancakes three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the morning I visited Gabi, we stopped by the hospital for her first visit since she had relearned how to walk. She hummed along to Britney Spears while we drove down US-290.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How are you feeling?" I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excited, mostly," she answered.&lt;/p&gt;

Having a certain amount of preparation in hand. What’s even better? The possibility of preventing the disease with efforts put in beforehand, or at least delaying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what if there’s a way to predict it way before the symptoms arise?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, scientists have made that possible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Researchers observe DNA methylation in Alzheimer's disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s happening&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a major scientific breakthrough, researchers at the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-scientists-create-tool-to-predict-alzheimers-risk-years-before-symptoms-begin/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; have developed a new tool that can estimate someone’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease years before any memory problems or symptoms surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on data from decades of brain-health tracking, this model draws on genetic information, age, sex, and advanced brain imaging to generate personalized risk scores. The goal? To give people a head start — time to plan, intervene, or adjust their lifestyle long before cognitive decline sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it is, how it works, and why it matters a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The groundbreaking tool&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the Mayo Clinic have introduced &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1105385" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a powerful predictive model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; that estimates an individual’s likelihood of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer’s-related dementia in the future — even when they currently show no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tool is built on rich, long-term data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, one of the most comprehensive population-based brain health studies in the world. By combining multiple risk factors — including age, sex, genetic risk (particularly the APOE ε4 gene), and brain amyloid burden measured by PET scans — the model provides estimates of risk both for the next 10 years and over one’s lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful predictors in the model is the amyloid levels in the brain, as measured by PET imaging. According to the researchers, higher amyloid levels strongly correlate with a greater risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the tool works: Key factors&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Age and sex:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Older age naturally raises the risk. The model also accounts for differences in risk between men and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Genetics (APOE ε4):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; People with the APOE ε4 variant have a markedly higher lifetime risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Amyloid PET scan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This imaging test shows how much amyloid plaque is in the brain — a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. The researchers found this to be the strongest single predictor in their model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong u" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Using these inputs, the tool calculates two key metrics:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;10-year risk of developing MCI or dementia,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lifetime risk, giving a broader perspective on long-term chances of cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is this innovation so important&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia, slowly robs people of memory, independence, identity, and even their personality. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 55 million people live with dementia globally, and Alzheimer’s makes up around 60–70% of those cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease has a long “silent” phase: changes in the brain — like amyloid plaque formation and tau tangles — often happen many years before any outward signs of memory loss. Until now, it has been difficult to identify who is most at risk during this pre-symptomatic stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new tool, clinicians could potentially stratify risk: identifying people who might benefit from closer monitoring, preventative interventions, or future therapies before they develop serious symptoms. As one of the study’s authors, Dr. Ronald Petersen, explains, the tool could guide decisions about when to start such strategies, similar to how doctors use cholesterol levels to assess heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the future holds&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the promising tool is a research instrument, not a standard clinical test. It relies on PET imaging, which can be expensive, and not everyone has easy access to PET scans — so that’s a challenge. Moreover, the model may not yet include other emerging markers, such as blood-based biomarkers, although those are planned for future versions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But because the tool can stratify risk so precisely, it may help doctors decide when to begin treatment or preventive strategies. In the future, versions of this tool could become more accessible: researchers hope to add blood-based biomarkers (such as those found in routine blood tests), which would make risk testing less invasive and more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model also supports precision medicine in Alzheimer’s — tailoring prevention and care based on a person’s individual biology and risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s important to remember that a risk estimate is not a diagnosis: a higher risk doesn’t guarantee someone will develop Alzheimer’s, and a lower risk doesn’t mean they’re safe forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 08:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>闻到这种香味可以立即提高注意力，增强大脑的能量，不，这不是咖啡-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/home-remedies/smelling-this-fragrance-can-instantly-improve-focus-and-supercharge-the-brain-and-no-its-not-coffee/photostory/125350607.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peppermint is incredibly easy to add to the daily routine, and even small doses can make a noticeable difference in mental clarity.

However, it is important to note that &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557876/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;too much vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; can also be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; looks at three recent studies to examine the possible role vitamin D may have in supporting health and boosting longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent literature review of 50 studies and more than 1 million participants suggest that vitamin D may help decrease the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/155598" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; and also improve survival for the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/8/1351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in April 2025, the review found that higher serum vitamin D levels were associated with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/vitamin-d-may-decrease-risk-colorectal-cancer-benefits-improve-survival" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;a reduced risk of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, among those with colorectal cancer, higher vitamin D levels were linked to improved survival and reduced mortality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the review suggested that vitamin D helps the immune system and may assist with decreasing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D may also possess specific anticancer properties, such as supporting programmed cell death and stopping uncontrolled cell growth. The authors added that vitamin D may be a useful adjunctive option alongside other cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite these promosing associations, the researchers noted that more research is still necessary, particularly large-scale, randomized clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some research noted that both dietary vitamin D and vitamin D supplements have beneficial effects on colorectal cancer, other studies did not find a significant relationship between vitamin D and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies highlighted that results may differ due to factors such as &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323586" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;body mass index (BMI)&lt;/a&gt;, sex, and nutritional status. It may be helpful for further research to explore components like how people’s genetics, lifestyle choices, and use of other treatments play a role in vitamin D’s effects on cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/wael-harb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Wael Harb&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified hematologist and medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, who was not involved in the study, commented to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For patients with [colorectal cancer], ensuring adequate vitamin D levels may help support immune surveillance and potentially improve outcomes when used alongside standard therapies.

Telomere length shortens with age, and telomere shortening is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8533433/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/common-elderly-health-issues" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;age-related diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomized, with half receiving 2,000 IU, or 50 mcg, of vitamin D daily, and the remaining receiving a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The findings indicated that in those receiving vitamin D3, telomere shortening in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Cancer Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/leukocyte" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;leukocytes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, a type of white blood cells, over the study period was significantly less compared with the placebo. The authors estimated this effect to be equivalent to about a 3-year reduction in &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/chronological-aging" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;biological aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that the effect of vitamin D was more evident in participants who did not have &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323551" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, those not taking &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cholesterol-medications" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cholesterol-lowering medications&lt;/a&gt;, and in participants of different ethnicities. Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation appeared to have no significant impact on telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalofficesofmanhattan.com/our-team/dr-yoshua-quinones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Yoshua Quinones&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to LabFinder, who was not involved in the study, explained that&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we know already, vitamin D supports bone, immune system and reduces inflammation, but this study is linked directly with telomere preservation which ties into aging and disease prevention. This [study] gives more of a general idea that vitamin D3 could do more than just helping your bones but actually slowing down the cellular age, impressive!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the researchers acknowledge that the analysis was a post-hoc examination of the VITAL trial, which was not originally designed to look at the effects of supplements on leukocyte telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, most participants were white and older adults, so it may not be possible to generalize the findings to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The TARGET-D trial involved 630 participants, most of which were males with an average age of 63, who enrolled within a month of having a &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/signs-of-a-heart-attack" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers randomly selected the control group and who would receive targeted vitamin D3 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At enrollment, 87% of participants had low vitamin D levels and the average vitamin D level was 27 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tailored vitamin D3 supplementation by measuring blood vitamin D levels and adjusting the dose so that individuals reached a target serum level of approximately 40 ng/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers monitored &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/normal-vitamin-d-levels" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;vitamin D3 levels&lt;/a&gt; throughout the trial and would adjust doses to maintain the target level. They also kept track of major &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/cardiovascular-system" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt; events throughout the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there was no significant difference between groups in overall cardiac events, the rate of follow-up heart attacks was 3.8% in the vitamin D3 treatment group compared to 7.9% in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, while the results suggest that targeted vitamin D3 supplementation may not reduce all major cardiac outcomes, it did cut the risk of repeat heart attacks by more than half.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/cheng-han-chen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Cheng-Han Chen&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center, who was not involved in this study, explained that while past research has linked higher blood levels of vitamin D with lower heart disease rates, “it mostly appears that the relationship between vitamin D3 and heart health is that of correlation rather than that of causation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that vitamin D3 may still offer some cardiovascular benefits, such as “decreasing inflammation and lowering blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he cautioned that the evidence remains mixed. He added that if larger studies confirm the recent finding that targeted vitamin D3 treatment could reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks, “it would be quite significant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 06:55:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQb2NseG9iU193alpqMi1ETld6eXpzYngteGVqNmJMNTJwb1hwOXlVQVZzRU54ZEN2ZDJjWW4zWFA1SGtUSEZ0WkFRSjVIOWZtSVhJYXI3VGRvcW9KTUt2U1RNcDFmdzdhelFhcVRpYkZTME9tRWp2SjRFTjdLUzFqalpfYWt6dGhqQkJnMXhGQkZaTEl3bFhZRllZd0owaEEzNVdhZDJWREJQRU0</guid></item><item><title>开创性的“未来奶牛场”为奶牛提供了选择的自由- SciTechDaily</title><link>https://scitechdaily.com/groundbreaking-dairy-farm-of-the-future-provides-cows-the-freedom-of-choice/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 05:12:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxOaHhJZ1padkM1bDlIUk9oTGlsc29feWxZUlV4aUJhOE9RUm1INWctMEVIWjFjT0lvMmVXQ2hNV0hONHlTZWRtbUtta0ZiZE9iZENOTVRWVEkxRGFFVWdLQW5hU1hGQmxNVDdWSmtBVExkWk5semp6UUo1ZjNTdllHMHh4aWdmYjZlT1VZSGVCbXlhWUpQV3hlVml5SVlTZG1NWGE4</guid></item><item><title>缓解气体和腹胀的自然方法：在11天内重置肠道的7个技巧-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/natural-ways-to-relieve-gas-and-bloating-7-tips-to-reset-your-gut-in-11-days/photostory/125321598.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gas and bloating have become common digestive issues, leaving the abdomen feeling heavy, swollen, and at times, painful.

&lt;p&gt;285 pounds. Forty-three years old. Summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Have you thought about GLPs?” my primary care physician asked as she listened to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I laughed nervously. “No, but I am now.” Humor has always been my shield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She didn’t flinch. “Your BMI is over 40. You’re at risk for all sorts of health conditions. Why don’t you look into our weight-loss program?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My labs were fine. But that didn’t matter. My body size alone was enough to warrant a prescription. I left feeling ashamed, reminded once again that medicine sees fatness as a disease in itself — regardless of actual health indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995, I was 14 years old and weighed 367 pounds when an endocrinologist bluntly told my mother that I would “likely be bedridden by 20.” He described my legs as “enormous” and referred me to bariatric surgery. Soon after, I underwent a stomach stapling procedure that left an eight-inch scar down my chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, pediatric weight loss surgery was &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10733812/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;quite rare&lt;/a&gt;. But to my doctors, my fat body made it acceptable — even necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure turned eating into a cycle of pain and vomiting. Food lodged in the tiny passage created by the staples left me doubled over until I threw it back up. I became, in effect, a medically induced bulimic — praised, nonetheless, for my weight-loss “success.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a year, I had lost nearly 100 pounds. Friends, family and even acquaintances congratulated me. No one saw the violence done to my body or the damage it did to my relationship with food. They didn’t know the surgery left me dependent on &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/rossyoder/best-ice-cream-brands"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt;, crackers and mashed potatoes because I could easily chew that stuff down to a pureed consistency to avoid the pain that followed whenever food got stuck in my staples. After the surgery, and even still today, I can’t tolerate most fruit — too acidic — nor many vegetables — too fibrous. Stomach stapling didn’t make me “healthier;” it only made me thinner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That surgery didn’t even “cure” me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two decades later, in 2017, weighing nearly 390 pounds, I went under the knife again, this time for a sleeve gastrectomy. By then, I had surrendered to the &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-states-weight-loss-market-084700368.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;diet industrial complex, a multibillion-dollar ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; built around the idea that fat bodies are inherently flawed. The pressure was relentless — to fix, shrink and manage a body that medicine had always treated as a problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the scrutiny wasn’t limited to exam rooms. In restaurants, on airplanes, at conferences, strangers felt entitled to comment on my body. I’ve been mocked for eating a donut, told loudly in a food court that I was “killing myself,” and subjected to humiliating requests to be reseated on flights. I’ve even overheard cruel remarks in a language people assumed I didn’t understand. Those moments left wounds far deeper than any heat rash or bruise from too-small chairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society’s obsession with fatness extends well beyond personal interactions. Fat people are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9125650/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;consistently portrayed in the media&lt;/a&gt; as lazy, undisciplined or morally flawed. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2001.108" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Research has documented&lt;/a&gt; how these stereotypes influence health care practices and workplace discrimination. This cultural narrative seeps into medicine, where clinicians — even those with good intentions — can unconsciously perpetuate stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, at 44, I’m on Wegovy. Reluctantly. When I started, I told my doctor my goal weight was 250 pounds — a number that, at 5’10”, felt right to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I weigh 235, down 50 pounds in eight months. My doctor tells me to stay on it. And I’m not sure why I’m listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially approved to treat Type 2 diabetes, GLP-1 medications like Wegovy are now viewed as a &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Wegovy-A-Breakthrough-in-Weight-Loss.aspx" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; for weight loss, but for me, they feel like another chapter in the same story: doctors offering interventions driven less by my actual health and more by the fear and stigma that surround fatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do I take it? Because sometimes it feels easier to live with the physical and emotional side effects of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780080970868640205" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7974834" data-affiliate="true"&gt;medicalization&lt;/a&gt; than with the relentless judgment of others — and, most troubling of all for me, with my own internalized fatphobia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the truth: Fat patients aren’t blank slates waiting for salvation. We know the statistics, the risks, the medical language. What we also know — often more than our doctors — is the crushing weight of fatphobia disguised as medical concern.&lt;/p&gt;

The results were worrying: The mice showed reduced sperm count and movement, and their testicular tissue displayed signs of stress and cell damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These effects were linked to a specific biological chain reaction that triggered cell "self-destruction" and tissue loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the study doesn't mean everyone who eats from plastic plates is in immediate danger, it adds to growing evidence that plastic pollution isn't just an environmental issue; it's a human one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If tiny plastic fragments can make their way into the body and potentially disrupt reproduction, that raises real concerns for communities already facing fertility challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This finding highlights how everyday choices, like reaching for a plastic fork or microwave-safe container, can have unseen health impacts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can we do about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The good news is that reducing exposure is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Choosing glass, metal, or ceramic tableware instead of single-use plastic is a &lt;a href="http://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:simple start;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;simple start&lt;/a&gt;. Supporting policies that limit microplastic release from packaging and promoting safer materials for food storage can also make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As more research sheds light on how plastics affect the human body, small shifts in how we eat and store food could help pave the way toward a cleaner, healthier future for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?recBqGTV3M4QX85E2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 03:15:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxPVG5mMjJQZTZtQWdGVGtnSkVHbGlSenhEZVRwWmJ5c2tYWU9ma2Z4M0VXU1V2NXcxM0g1ZFdJaE1EX2xqMVotcVphYmNLdGZNd3RsbkJYa2RwZUtMcGoxMlQxM1FpbXlVbUdYdjlxMXB6VXRtR0pmZFlaUUREYXVpT0haUS1pT2hwMXZZdnZ4Y2RRX2xG</guid></item><item><title>拥有30年经验的纽约心脏病专家分享“10个可以延长10年寿命的简单技巧” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/new-york-cardiologist-with-30-years-of-experience-shares-10-simple-tips-that-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-101763259612120.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/new-york-cardiologist-with-30-years-of-experience-shares-10-simple-tips-that-can-add-10-years-to-your-life-101763259612120.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Want to add a decade to your life?

Let's begin. I'm Dr Evan, board certified cardiologist. Number one, I would never smoke or be around anyone who smokes. Dozens of known carcinogens, plus increasing your risk of stroke, heart attacks, vascular disease, even aortic aneurysms, and high blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing a list of things to avoid, he added, “Number two, no alcohol, or at least stick to less than a few drinks a week. They're cancer-causing. They raise blood pressure. The alcohol industry and its surrogates lie to us. Number three, fast food. Don't open the door. Never walk inside. Toxic, dense calories that poisoned millions. Number four, all drugs and stimulants. I'm including marijuana here. And I'd also include limiting those ADHD meds to the lowest possible doses.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/16/original/AI_1763260454561.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Make these small changes that can add up to a healthier, happier you.

(Made using ChatGPT)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do any exercise, check your blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Levine also advised engaging in regular exercise, aiming for at least 7,000 steps daily, and monitoring key health metrics, such as blood pressure and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He went on to share what you should ideally be doing for a long life, and said, “Number five, do any exercise. That includes even walking. &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/is-walking-a-good-idea-what-walking-for-30-minutes-every-day-can-do-to-your-health-101728132003995.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Walking is great."&gt;Walking is great.&lt;/a&gt; At least 7,000 steps a day. Pretty easy stuff. Number six, check your blood pressure with a goal of 120 over 80 or less. Number seven, check your cholesterol and treat if that LDL is above 190 with a statin. &lt;span class="highlight"&gt;Otherwise, with diet and exercise, those coronary artery calcium scans in young patients with heart attacks are often normal, and these tests have limited benefit in this age group.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ditch stress and toxic people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardiologist also highlighted the importance of stress reduction by avoiding toxic individuals and establishing consistent, healthy sleep habits, which lay a foundation for longevity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He concluded: “Number eight, no sodas or toxic sugar drinks... number nine,&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/cardiologist-explains-if-exercise-can-help-remove-or-prevent-heart-blockage-reduce-stress-lower-blood-pressure-high-bp-101754387406907.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="reduce stress"&gt; reduce stress &lt;/a&gt;and people that cause stress. Build your foundation of friends. Avoid those narcissists, no matter how attractive they may be. And number 10, start a healthy sleeping habit. I hope that helps.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.
