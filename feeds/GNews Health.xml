Nearly 70% of doctors polled said they think &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2023/03/29/misinformation-bad-your-health-doctors-say-new-poll/11559933002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;patient trust declined&lt;/a&gt; from 2020 to 2022, but only 21% of Americans said the same, according to a &lt;a href="https://debeaumont.org/news/2023/physician-poll-medical-misinformation-is-harming-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2023 poll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Experts previously told USA TODAY it's all the more crucial people understand how to distinguish fact from fiction, especially when it comes to their health. More than ever, people should also make sure their health protocols and diets are not clouded by politics or ideology as doing so can help prevent worst-case-scenario outcomes like this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87697633007-getty-images-1327818236.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=349&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87697633007-getty-images-1327818236.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=698&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="A baby died.

"It's hurting physicians. It's hurting medical practice. And it's hurting the American public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The horrific Arizona tragedy and how we got here&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Police found Tremaure Stanley, 25, and Janiece Brooks, 26, living in a central Phoenix home where their youngest child was discovered dead in July 2023 after Brooks called 911 because their baby was unresponsive. Three surviving siblings, ages 2, 4 and 5 at the time, were subsequently hospitalized with rickets, osteopenia, vitamin D deficiency and significant developmental delays, court records show. The couple was charged with first-degree murder and four counts of child abuse. They met with prosecutors Dec. 1 to discuss a possible plea deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Prosecutors said the pattern of harm traces back to an extreme version of the "alkaline diet" the couple imposed on their children, combined with a growing distrust of medical care. Court records show the couple told investigators they relied on online videos and posts that warned against vaccines, &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/12/06/trump-rfk-jr-hep-b-vaccine-guidance/87640999007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;infant medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; and even common medicines such as &lt;a href="/story/news/politics/2025/11/06/rfk-jr-tylenol-pregnant-women-autism/87127637007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Tylenol&lt;/a&gt;. They also avoided taking the children to doctor visits, limiting outside contact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This level of insulation has become increasingly common − and it can have serious consequences, Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and executive director of the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://www.unbiasedscience.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Unbiased Science&lt;/a&gt;, told the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What is the 'alkaline diet'?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alkaline diet in particular has become a dangerous, yet widespread, piece of misinformation. The diet is based on the disproven belief that shifting the body’s acidity levels can cure diseases or "detoxify" the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For the children in Arizona, the diet entailed eating mostly vegetables, fruit and plant-based milks − with almost no protein, fats or fortified foods crucial for overall health. Court records show the couple interpreted the children’s rapid weight loss as evidence the diet was working and removing toxins, rather than a sign of medical crisis. "We chose this diet for good health," Stanley told the court at a Dec. 1 settlement conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The alkaline diet has made waves in the oncology community too, offering &lt;a href="/story/life/2019/01/08/dietary-advice-can-beneficial-when-comes-cancer-diagnosis/2485895002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;false hope to those with cancer&lt;/a&gt;.

The truth, however, is that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/afs:Content:8703572316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;diets don't change the pH levels&lt;/a&gt; of blood cells or tissues and that eating more alkaline foods is not a proven preventive measure or cure for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why do people fall for dangerous health claims?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Jonathan Stea, a clinical psychologist and adjunct assistant professor at the University of Calgary who wrote a book about pseudoscience and misinformation in the wellness industry, told USA TODAY that extreme diets often function less like trends and more like belief systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Arizona case in particular comes at a time when, experts say, public confidence in scientific institutions has deeply frayed. Steier told USA TODAY this distrust has created fertile ground for misinformation to spread, especially in nutrition and wellness spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"They feel out of control, and I think the pandemic really threw gasoline on that fire," she said. "People are looking for this feeling of control over their health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Recent studies from the University of Alberta have shown science becoming more politicized as well, Stea said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"If someone strongly identifies as a Democrat and then strongly identifies as a Republican, those people might read the same piece of information but interpret it in different ways because they're coming at it from different belief systems," he said. "Motivated reasoning kicks in … confirmation bias gets activated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By promoting fear or false hope, misinformation can also cause mental and physical fatigue, &lt;a href="https://www.edqm.eu/en/david-novillo-ortiz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;David Novillo Ortiz&lt;/a&gt;, unit head on data digital health literacy for the World Health Organization, previously told USA TODAY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While social media can provide insight into your own health, Dr. Franziska Haydanek, an OBGYN and online health educator, previously advised that new information should always be &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/10/31/women-pain-health-support/75913932007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;discussed with your own doctor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You might say, ‘Hey, I learned about this condition.’ I feel it might apply to me.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm6pd6001w26p9bsdv8x6h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many medical organizations and frontline health care providers are grappling with a challenge they haven’t had to face in many years: how to protect newborns against hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyvzykg00073b6q8igauipw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last week, a federal advisory panel reversed its longstanding recommendation for universal vaccination at birth. Instead, the panel decided to rely on a mother’s test results for hepatitis B during pregnancy. The babies of women who test positive should still be vaccinated shortly after birth, the vaccine advisers said, and if the test is negative, parents should make a decision with their health-care provider on whether or when to vaccinate the child. Vaccinations would still be available to families who want them and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/07/health/hepatitis-b-vaccine-insurance-coverage"&gt;insurance should still cover them&lt;/a&gt;, members of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiysmlqq00003b6nr5gn9q1e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But relying on testing recalls an approach the United States tried in the 1980s and early ’90s that still led to thousands of cases of hepatitis B among children every year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyvq8rc00033b6q48iqk6vx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even with universal vaccination for newborns as the standard, universal testing for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/clinical-testing-guidelines.html" target="_blank"&gt;hepatitis B during pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; remained an important part of prenatal care in the United States for decades. The ACIP decision puts even more emphasis on that practice, said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00073b6nih5sxgql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It places a spotlight on testing,” he said. “Testing for hepatitis B virus is currently a standard part of prenatal care. It’s recommended to be tested in the first trimester or at the earliest first prenatal visit to get that answer as soon as possible. If a woman doesn’t have any prenatal care, then it’s often tested at delivery.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00093b6nzcft3o3l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some critics of ACIP’s decision argue that vaccinations always have been a shared decision between parents and health-care providers, and they worry that the shift could sow confusion and ultimately discourage parents from vaccinating their children altogether.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyv5ale00053b6qr62j4d8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It could mean testing carries the burden of hepatitis B prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyw8xwc000h3b6qgmcukplu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Testing alone will not work as an approach for hepatitis B prevention, said Dr. James Campbell, a pediatrician at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases. History has shown that some women may not have access to testing or just don’t get any prenatal care. The test may be falsely negative, or mothers could become infected after they get tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiyw9gwb000k3b6qvvn5nduu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My worry is that more Americans will believe we no longer need to pay attention to hepatitis B in children, and we will return to the time when many babies and young children were infected every year,” Campbell wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000e3b6nvaiuwrb6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said he fears that the new ACIP recommendation could lead more parents to rely on testing alone and could dissuade them from getting their newborns the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, leaving the infant potentially vulnerable to an infection – even if they are determined to be at low risk of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000f3b6nwgsl53qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I worry a little bit that this is going to send a message that it’s really not a concern and if you have your hepatitis B testing early in pregnancy and you’re not high-risk, you don’t need to do this,” said Fleischman, an associate chief of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale New Haven Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000g3b6n856l1yw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But even though you’re low-risk, you’re not no risk,” he said. “Even if there’s a minute risk that this could impact your baby, why wouldn’t you get this vaccine, which has for years been shown to be very safe?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000k3b6n58v8gie3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Hepatitis B is a serious &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;bloodborne viral infection&lt;/a&gt; that primarily attacks the liver. Many adults &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=For%20some%20people%2C%20hepatitis%20B,Causes" target="_blank"&gt;may clear an acute infection&lt;/a&gt; on their own, but acute infection can persist to chronic hepatitis B, which is linked with an increased risk of liver cancer, organ failure and cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, and even death.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000j3b6nliqlrahy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9320049/" target="_blank"&gt;first vaccines against the hepatitis B&lt;/a&gt; virus were developed in the early 1980s. Around that time, ACIP recommended pre-exposure vaccination initially for people at high risk of infection, such as men who have sex with men, injection-drug users and heterosexual persons with multiple partners. Despite this recommendation, some people at high risk were still not vaccinated, and infections spread, including in children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixn1trx00033b6q16gmn6zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;risk of chronic infection&lt;/a&gt; is highest among young children, with about 90% of infected infants and 30% of children infected between ages 1 to 5 estimated to remain chronically infected with hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000l3b6nmhun0u67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 1988, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000036.htm" target="_blank"&gt;ACIP recommended&lt;/a&gt; that all pregnant women be screened routinely for hepatitis B.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000m3b6nin0igxat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A blood test is the only way to know if someone is infected, because many people with hepatitis B may not look or feel sick. They may spread the virus unknowingly, through blood or other body fluids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000n3b6n9wox9hw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But testing alone did not work as efficiently as vaccinations in preventing hepatitis B, especially in children, said pediatrician Dr. Michael Warren, March of Dimes’ chief medical and health officer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000o3b6n38dx1erf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Testing during pregnancy really focuses on one mode of transmission, and that’s the mother-to-baby transmission, typically around the time of birth. That testing essentially doesn’t account for those cases of exposures after birth, so those cases that may be caused by exposure from other caregivers,” Warren said.

            For example, hepatitis B can spread if an infected caregiver has an open cut or sore and handles a pacifier before putting it in the baby’s mouth.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The other thing is, we know that some women may fall through the cracks and not get tested, or the test may not be 100% accurate,” he said. “Some things may get missed, including making sure the testing is done or even making sure a baby is getting all the care that they need. So making sure that we get testing done is key for addressing transmission at birth, but that birth dose of vaccine gives us protection for those exposures that may come after. It really is the ultimate safety net.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            By 1991, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;United States’ hepatitis B vaccination strategy had evolved&lt;/a&gt;. ACIP recommended broader efforts to eliminate transmission in the United States, with a focus on universal childhood vaccination at birth or shortly after, the prevention of mother-to-baby transmission of the virus, vaccinating adolescents and adults in high-risk groups, and catch-up vaccinations for susceptible children in high-risk populations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000r3b6n0m8p6fh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the time, some pediatric-care providers were hesitant to accept the ACIP recommendation that all newborns be vaccinated. However, by 1996, efforts to educate providers and parents about hepatitis B and the benefits of vaccination led to broader acceptance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000s3b6ndt3czvcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;data from the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, from 1993 through 2000, the national coverage rate for hepatitis B vaccine among babies ages 19 to 35 months rose from 16% to 90%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000t3b6n93skyatc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Back when the vaccine was first introduced in the ’80s and the approach was to only vaccinate babies who were born to women with hepatitis B, you were still seeing these later cases of hepatitis B in infancy, childhood and adolescence, because there are these other sources of exposure,” Warren said. “And so that birth dose of hepatitis B helps protect babies right from the start.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000v3b6nndjd77z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The testing of pregnant women for hepatitis B has remained a “crucial part” of preventing infections among newborns, said Campbell, from the American Academy of Pediatrics’ infectious disease committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000w3b6nvsuddb7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are many tests available, but the one primarily being discussed in this context is hepatitis B surface antigen. It is a blood test that is quite accurate at detecting persons infected with the hepatitis virus,” Campbell wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmizza11w00093b6qm482i0y5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This CDC advisory panel’s recommendations won’t become final until Jim O’Neill, the agency’s acting director, signs off. The CDC typically aligns with it advisers, but some doctors and lawmakers have urged O’Neill to reject their decision and maintain the recommendation for universal vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw000y3b6nfme9x83c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When the CDC’s recommendations are final, many medical organizations will probably re-examine their own individual guidelines for hepatitis B testing in pregnancy, said Fleischman, the ACOG president.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00103b6n5eocy11a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re going to probably have a conversation at our institution about do we want to consider additional hepatitis B surface antigen screening later in pregnancy,” he said. “It’s a conversation that’s probably happening among many obstetricians and hospitals.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Despite potential changes to CDC’s recommendation, the American Academy of Pediatrics and ACOG still continue to recommend that all babies get hepatitis B vaccinations in the first day of life, even if their mothers tested negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Some &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/searchable-download/Universal%20Hepatitis%20B%20Vaccination%20at%20Birth%202Dec2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that after the strategy to vaccinate children at birth was introduced, the incidence of hepatitis B infections among infants and young children each year declined from roughly 16,000 cases in the early 1990s to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2023/hepatitis-b/table-2-2.html" target="_blank"&gt;fewer than 20&lt;/a&gt; in recent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We’ve got now this history that shows that when we introduce the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine, that the cases of hepatitis B among infants dropped by 99%,” said Warren, of March of Dimes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmixm7wzw00133b6nbmtbnpv3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And we had not seen that before, even when there were risk-based recommendations,” he said. “This is a public health intervention that has been shown to be wildly successful.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;London —&lt;/em&gt; Sperm from a donor who unknowingly carried a cancer-causing gene has been used to conceive nearly 200 babies across Europe, an investigation by 14 European public service broadcasters, including CBS News' partner network BBC News, has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some children conceived using the sperm have already died from cancer, and the vast majority of those who inherited the gene will develop cancer in their lifetimes, geneticists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man carrying the gene passed screening checks before he became a donor at the European Sperm Bank when he was a student in 2005. His sperm has been used by women trying to conceive for 17 years across multiple countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancer-causing mutation occurred in the donor's TP53 gene — which prevents cells in the body from turning cancerous —   before his birth, according to the investigation. It causes Li Fraumeni syndrome, which gives affected people a 90% chance of developing cancers, particularly during childhood, as well as breast cancer in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up to 20% of the donor's sperm contained the mutated TP53 gene. Any children conceived with affected sperm will have the dangerous mutation in every cell of their body.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a dreadful diagnosis," cancer geneticist Clare Turnbull told the BBC. "It's a very challenging diagnosis to land on a family. There is a lifelong burden of living with that risk. It's clearly devastating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How was the discovery made?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected donor sperm was discovered when doctors seeing children with cancers linked to sperm donation raised concerns at this year's European Society of Human Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, 23 children with the genetic mutation had been discovered, out of 67 children linked to the donor. Ten of those children with the mutation had already been diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom of Information requests submitted by journalists across multiple countries revealed at least 197 children were affected, though it is not known how many inherited the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
    &lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More affected children could be discovered as more data becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have some children that have developed already two different cancers and some of them have already died at a very early age," Edwige Kasper, a cancer geneticist at France's Rouen University Hospital, told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Sperm Bank told CBS News that it does not ship to the United States due to U.S. regulations. A representative said the bank does work with with sperm banks in both Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did the sperm get used by women all over Europe?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor sperm was sold by the European Sperm Bank in Denmark to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nations have their own regulations about how many times a donor's sperm can be used domestically, but there is no international law restricting how many times a donor's sperm can be used worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears that some national laws were breached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Belgium, where sperm from a single donor is supposed to be used by a maximum of six families, 53 children were born to 38 different women using sperm from the donor with the genetic mutation, the investigation found.&lt;/p&gt;

These games took a lot of energy. But if I play a normal human match, my opponent would also be exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_23373484.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Why thinking hard makes us feel tired&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03905-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03905-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;machine intelligence&lt;/a&gt; can keep running as long as it has a power supply, a human brain will become fatigued — and you don’t have to be a chess grandmaster to understand the feeling. Anyone can end up drained after a long day of work, at school or juggling the countless decisions of daily life. This &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02161-5" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;mental exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; can sap motivation, dull focus and erode judgement. It can raise the odds of careless mistakes. Especially when combined with sleep loss or circadian disruption, cognitive fatigue can also contribute to deadly medical errors and road traffic accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was partly Kasparov’s weary comments that inspired Mathias Pessiglione, a cognitive neuroscientist and research director at the Paris Brain Institute, to study the tired brain. He wanted to know: “Why is this cognitive system prone to fatigue?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers and clinicians have long struggled to define, measure and treat cognitive fatigue — relying mostly on self-reports of how tired someone says they feel. Now, however, scientists from across disciplines are enlisting innovative experimental approaches and biological markers to probe the metabolic roots and consequences of cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efforts are getting a boost in attention and funding in large part because of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00901-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00901-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, which afflicts roughly 6 in every 100 people after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, says Vikram Chib, a biomedical engineer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. “The primary symptom of long COVID is fatigue,” says Chib. “I think that has opened a lot of people’s eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chib and others hope that a fundamental understanding of cognitive fatigue will help the billions of people who face it from time to time, as well as the tens of millions who carry it as a more extreme and chronic companion. As well as being common in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01511-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01511-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, debilitating fatigue is a symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome, also known as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS)&lt;/a&gt;, post-traumatic stress disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00808-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00808-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, depression and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02196-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02196-4" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. Extreme mental exhaustion can also follow cancer treatment, head injury, stroke or exposure to certain toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fatigue is a really big problem,” says Chib. “We really need to figure this out — how to study it and how to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is cognitive fatigue?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of a chess match, a professional player might rely on well-rehearsed openings. “The first five, six or seven moves can be done without thinking,” says Pessiglione. But when there’s an unfamiliar position on the board, the player no longer has a ready routine. They are “required to think”, he says. The same is true for a driver who turns on to an unfamiliar street. On roads they’ve been down hundreds of times, mental autopilot can kick in. But if they take an unknown route, Pessiglione says, the demands on the brain intensify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control is the term that scientists give to this effortful directing and regulating of thought. Over time, as a leading theory goes, maintaining control becomes costly for the brain, and fatigue emerges. Scientists aren’t entirely sure why. Some think it is related to how cells cope when their energy supply is strained; others point to a build-up of toxins from neural activity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But researchers tend to agree that the sensation of fatigue is protective — a warning that the brain is nearing a physiological boundary and it’s time to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Fans watch a chess game between Garry Kasparov — shown on a TV monitor — and Deep Blue." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793290.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;During chess matches in 1996 and 1997, Russian grandmaster Garry Kasparov grew tired, unlike his opponent, IBM’s Deep Blue computer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Stan Honda/AFP via Getty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molecular players across several brain regions might be involved, scientists say. Researchers have found potential links between cognitive fatigue and changing levels of metabolites such as glucose and lactate, neurochemical messengers such as glutamate and adenosine, and a protein involved in learning and memory called brain-derived neurotrophic factor&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Even amyloid-β, a protein fragment associated with &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00651-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00651-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, might contribute by disrupting synapses, interfering with the clearance of glutamate or increasing &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00509-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. But it is uncertain what is a marker and what is a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive neuroscientist Clay Holroyd at Ghent University in Belgium is among the researchers who favour the toxic-build-up theory of cognitive fatigue. This idea has been gaining traction over the past five years or so, although it’s not yet clear what the waste metabolite is. He likens the sensation of fatigue to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;: both have a role in protecting the body from accumulating damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if a person ignores the sensation at first, he says, there’s little risk of real metabolic harm in most cases. “We have an automatic fail-safe,” he says. “You can work really, really, really hard for a time, but eventually you’re going to need to go to sleep.” Although taking a break from a task can offer temporary relief, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03148-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03148-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sleep has a much more restorative role&lt;/a&gt;. Sleep, especially slow-wave deep sleep, acts as the brain’s nightly maintenance. It clears out metabolic debris and recalibrates circuits and cells so that they can best use energy reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seeking better measures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conventionally, cognitive fatigue has been quantified either by asking a person to report their own levels of fatigue or by detecting a change in their performance on working-memory tests or other tasks. These are not great measurements, scientists say. Drops in performance can be obscured by factors such as motivation, boredom and frustration. Performance can also be offset by training, such as when a chess player automates a sequence of moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reports, meanwhile, are subjective and unreliable. “People are terrible judges of their own fatigue,” says Daniel Forger, a researcher in computational medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who is investigating new ways to assess cognitive fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03904-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51809464.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Long-COVID research just got a big funding boost: will it find new treatments?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand fatigue, Pessiglione, Chib and other researchers are trying to bridge an understanding of its biochemical workings with how it affects &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00675-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00675-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;motivation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The current hypothesis: cognitive fatigue arises from metabolic changes in parts of the brain that are responsible for cognitive control. And those changes, whether resulting from depleted energy stores or amassed waste, alter how brain circuits weigh the costs and benefits of exerting mental effort — nudging decisions towards easier options that are more immediately rewarding&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2022 study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, Pessiglione and his team simulated a workday by asking otherwise healthy participants to spend several hours on either easy or hard versions of the same cognitive tasks. In one task, participants viewed letters appearing one after another on a screen and had to decide whether each new letter matched one a certain number of letters earlier. Recalling whether the letter on screen matched the third letter back, for example, would be much more difficult than recalling whether it matched the first letter back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this simulated workday, participants made choices between smaller immediate rewards and larger delayed ones. Those who had completed the harder tasks were more likely to opt for instant gratification. That preference was also consistent with greater accumulation of glutamate — one of the metabolites suspected to build up with cognitive exertion — in the lateral prefrontal cortex. This brain region is involved in executive functions, such as working memory and decision-making, and has been found to have lower activity after a hard day of simulated work&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR6" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Apps, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Birmingham, UK, says that the dynamics of dopamine — which interacts closely with adenosine, glutamate and other metabolic players in the brain — might help to explain the connection between neurometabolic strain and the experience of fatigue. Because dopamine enhances the perceived value of rewards, it typically boosts motivation to invest effort. He proposes that sustained effort might cause dopamine levels to drop, leaving people less willing to work for the same pay-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these and similar lines of research are starting to reveal how levels of these molecules and measures of brain activity align with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, says Chib, is that there is “something happening with the chemistry of your brain” that changes your calculation on whether you should exert cognitive effort. He says that baseline chemistry will differ between people: “You and I might have different concentrations of neurotransmitters in our brain, and that inherent difference could make me feel very tired, whereas you’re able to persist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03299-8" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03974-w/d41586-025-03974-w_51793258.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;First proposed blood test for chronic fatigue syndrome: what scientists think&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These, or similar differences in chemistry, might help to explain chronic and other extreme fatigue. In people with long COVID or ME/CFS, a small mental task can feel as intimidating as performing brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ana Lia Tamariz, an artist and health-and-wellness coach in Miami, Florida, who has ME/CFS, simply listening to music or reading a book often requires immense effort. “Sometimes, I cannot read one more word,” she says. “Imagine coming out of anaesthesia from a surgical procedure groggy. Imagine you never exit that state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her, the cognitive and physical fatigue can be hard to separate. Any cognitively demanding task can make her physically drained, she says. And anything physically demanding can leave her mentally spent. Tamariz says she is constantly doing the calculation: “Is this worth my energy?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research supports the idea that some shared mechanisms might drive both physical and cognitive fatigue, and that the two interact&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR7" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. “If you run a marathon, yes, there is physical fatigue in your body,” says Apps. “But by God, you’re going to feel all kinds of cognitive fatigue as well from the strain and the concentration that’s required to maintain your performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverse also seems to be true. In a preprint from last year, Chib’s team found that otherwise healthy participants were less willing to exert physical effort after performing a mentally taxing task&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR8" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other researchers are studying the roles of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02066-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, sleep, circadian rhythms and inflammation in cognitive fatigue, as well as the consequences. When the brain doesn’t get restorative sleep, small clusters of neurons can go briefly offline. These local sleep-like episodes can cause momentary lapses in attention and other slips in performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Parents can also be more intentional about challenging sexist assumptions in the home. Not least since, when men show hostility towards women, which has been dubbed "hostile masculinity", it &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210524-the-gender-biases-that-shape-our-brains" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;has been linked&lt;/a&gt; to increased incidences of violence against women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On a societal level, policy measures can help address these imbalances, such as providing paid family leave for all workers, men and women alike. This has been successfully implemented in several Nordic countries, where a paid "use it or lose it" approach &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210712-paternity-leave-the-hidden-barriers-keeping-men-at-work" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;has increased the number of men taking parental leave&lt;/a&gt;. This in turn normalises and values caregiving and with more support at home, helps keep women more closely tied to the workforce, limiting the economic damage.

A growing group of researchers is now asking whether this long-standing approach may be missing something important. What if the real path to a cure is not to damage cancer, but to coax it into healing instead?&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That provocative idea is at the heart of work led by Professor Indraneel Mittra at the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer in Mumbai, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is not completely new. In 1986, an article in the &lt;em&gt;New Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; by Dr. Harold Dvorak suggested that cancer behaves very much like a wound that never heals. Cancer and chronic wounds share many biological features, and Professor Mittra argues that, rather than always trying to destroy tumors, medicine should explore ways to help them move toward a healed, less aggressive state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent study involving people with glioblastoma, one of the most feared brain cancers, his team reports that a simple combination of two low-cost nutraceuticals appears to support exactly this kind of healing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing a Gentle Strategy in Glioblastoma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma is a fast-growing, highly aggressive brain tumor. Even with modern treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, used alone or together, patients typically survive a median of only about 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;BJC Reports&lt;/em&gt;, Professor Mittra and colleagues enrolled ten patients with glioblastoma and asked them to take a tablet containing small amounts of two nutraceuticals, resveratrol and copper. They took this tablet four times a day for an average of 11.6 days before their scheduled brain surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of ten patients, whose tumors were similarly aggressive but who did not receive resveratrol and copper, served as the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During surgery, the team collected brain tumor samples from both groups. These samples were then examined in detail using microscopy, immune-staining, immunofluorescence and transcriptome analysis to see how the tumors differed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyses showed that the nutraceutical tablets had a striking effect on tumor biology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dramatic Changes Inside the Tumors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several key cancer markers shifted in a favorable direction in patients who received the resveratrol and copper tablets:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Average levels of the protein Ki-67, a widely used indicator of how quickly glioblastoma cells are dividing, were almost one third lower in treated tumors than in untreated ones. This suggests the cancer was growing less aggressively.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Biomarkers associated with nine major "hallmarks of cancer" were present in 57% fewer cells in the treated samples.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Levels of six immune checkpoints, proteins that normally prevent the immune system from attacking cancer cells, were on average 41% lower in the treated tumors.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Three markers linked to stem cells, which may help tumors spread and resist treatment, were 56% lower in the treated group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucially, the patients who took the nutraceutical tablets did not experience any side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest that a simple, inexpensive and non-toxic nutraceutical tablet potentially has the power to heal glioblastoma," said Professor Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting Cell-Free Chromatin Particles (cfChPs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how might this apparent healing happen at the cellular level?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Professor Mittra, the key action involves resveratrol and copper acting on cell-free chromatin particles (cfChPs) (cfChPs) that circulate in the body. These are fragments of DNA released from dying cancer cells that can worsen the behavior of surviving cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier work from his group showed that when resveratrol and copper are combined, they generate oxygen radicals that deactivate or destroy cfChPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers found that cfChPs were abundant in tissue taken from untreated tumors, but were almost completely absent from tissue taken from tumors in patients who had received the nutraceutical tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that dead cancer cells in the treated group were removed through apoptosis, a controlled cell death process, before they could release cfChPs into the surrounding environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Mittra explains: "The cell-free chromatin particles, fragments of DNA released by dying cancer cells, inflame the surviving cancer cells. This makes the disease more aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you eliminate the cell-free chromatin, which is what the resveratrol-copper tablets do, the cancer is subdued."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds that with longer-term use, this approach might possibly lead to complete healing of the cancer, effectively turning a malignant tumor into a benign one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Checkpoints and a Low Cost Alternative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable findings from the study is that the resveratrol-copper tablets reduced the activity of several immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoint inhibition has been hailed as a breakthrough in cancer therapy, because blocking these proteins can unleash the immune system against tumors. However, current immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs are extremely expensive and can cause significant side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the nutraceutical combination used in this study is simple, non-toxic and inexpensive, yet still appears to downregulate multiple immune checkpoints. This raises the possibility of a more accessible way to influence some of the same pathways targeted by costly cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Potential Shift in Cancer Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach to treating cancer has begun to emerge from these observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have been trying to kill cancer cells for 2,500 years, since the time of the ancient Greeks, without success," says Professor Mittra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Maybe it is time to look at cancer treatment differently and work towards healing tumors, rather than annihilating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Of course, the number of patients in this study was rather small. However, the results were so striking that I'd fully expect them to be replicated in a larger sample of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I believe that we may be on the brink of transforming the way cancer is treated."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the line, she said, was the head of the fertility department at a Belgian clinic she had visited in 2011 to undergo fertility treatment, which at the time was not available to would-be single mothers in France. After her daughter was successfully conceived, she said, she had never heard from the clinic again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caller told her that the sperm donor she had used to conceive her daughter carried a rare &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/genetics-and-genomics/t-69899904"&gt;genetic&lt;/a&gt; mutation of the TP53 gene, which suppresses cancerous growth. The mutation is linked to a heightened and lifelong risk of multiple &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/cancer/t-64554675"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt; — many of which can develop at a very early age. The caller said her daughter had a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation, for which there is no cure or treatment. It was, she was told, "urgent" for her to screen her daughter for the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It was a shock," said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous. "I didn't understand anything." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would soon learn that her daughter did indeed carry the genetic mutation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, after the mutation was detected in his samples, the donor had been permanently blocked in October 2023 by the European Sperm Bank (ESB), which had sold the sperm. Though the clinic maintains that it contacted the woman "as soon as possible," it told her she received the call a year and a half after the ESB discovered the mutation because it had migrated its computer system and initially lost her contact details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sperm donor 7069&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated by the EBU Investigative Journalism Network, an investigation by DW and several other European public broadcasters reveals that, for more than 15 years, women in at least 14 countries in Europe and elsewhere were sold sperm from donor 7069. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035217" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035217_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="A sperm bank is viewed from the outside: a red-brick building with bikes parked in front"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The ESB exported donor 7069's sperm to 67 fertility clinics in 14 countries &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Iceland to Albania and beyond, at least 197 children were conceived with donor 7069's sperm, the investigation shows. It is possible that the number is far higher — the ESB has yet to disclose the total number of children conceived with his sperm. And so doctors are unable to say whether all of them have even been tested at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, a rare and potentially fatal genetic mutation was sold to families across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the donor-conceived children have already developed two different sorts of cancer; others "have already died," said Edwige Kasper, a biologist who specializes in genetic predispositions to cancer. She is counseling some of the affected families. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, the sperm bank has the obligation to alert all fertility clinics to which it exported gametes of any genetic abnormalities that arise. The clinics, in turn, inform parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet DW and its partners have learned of several cases of families who were never officially informed that their children might be carriers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'A big frustration'&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dorte Kellermann, a single mother who lives in Denmark, said she learned about the case in November 2023 from another parent who had used the donor. She told DW and its partners that she had not been contacted by either the sperm bank or the fertility clinic she had used. And, she said, she was aware of other families — single mothers who had used the same donor, and who had connected via a private Facebook group. The former director of the clinic Kellermann had used said he could not comment on individual cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though DW is unable to verify each of the Facebook group's accounts, they are consistent with those of doctors and reports issued by health authorities across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Svetlana Lagercrantz, who specializes in hereditary cancers, told the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, one of DW's partners in the investigation, that several of her patients in Sweden had never been contacted. She said they had only found out about the mutation through media reports. It was, she said, "a big frustration." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035287" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035287_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="Dr. Svetlana Lagercrantz sits in her office, wearing glasses, a blue shirt and a lanyard"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Svetlana Lagercrantz and other doctors say early cancer detection is essential to saving lives&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it took a gathering of hereditary cancer experts in 2024 to realize the extent of the problem. Lagercrantz said a French colleague was talking about patients who had inherited the TP53 mutation from their sperm donor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, she said, doctors from across Europe realized that what they had assumed were singular cases were in fact all fathered by one single donor — spanning the continent and even beyond. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It left her "shaken." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lifelong screening&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citing privacy concerns, the ESB has so far refused to provide the exact number of children conceived with donor 7069's sperm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035233" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035233_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="plates on a building identify the offices of the European Sperm Bank"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;The European Sperm Bank has refused to provide the exact number of donor 7069's offspring&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Since we don't know how many women have children with the donor, you keep thinking: But is there one more child?" Lagercrantz said. For her and her colleagues, it is "hard to let go of that thought." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who are found to carry the mutation have to undergo regular and lifelong checkups. As cancer is particularly rare in children, she said, symptoms may be overlooked or misinterpreted when doctors are not aware of the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The earlier you detect the cancer, the better the chance you have to cure it," she said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs as early as 2020&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ESB's website resembles a dating site, allowing potential clients to browse donor profiles and — for an extra fee — hear audio interviews and view childhood photos. Clients can fork over almost €1,000 ($1,165) for a more comprehensive genetic test than the routine tests sperm is required to undergo in Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DW and its partners came across donor 7069's online profile first listed as early as 2007: "Kjeld," a tall white man with light brown hair and brown eyes who was listed as an "M.S. Economy Student." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first warning came in 2020, according to the ESB, when the bank received a notification that a child conceived with Kjeld's sperm had been diagnosed as carrying the TP53 mutation. His sperm was placed under quarantine until further genetic testing.​ ​The results came back negative, as the rare mutation occurs only in some of the donor's sperm cells. The donor himself showed no symptoms. And his sperm was returned to the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the ESB was informed of another child carrying the TP53 mutation. A new round of testing found that the mutation was indeed present in a portion of the donor's sperm. This prompted a permanent ban — and phone calls to parents across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;No Europe-wide cap on donor offspring&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headquartered in Copenhagen, the ESB has emerged as a major player in the global fertility trade, claiming to export sperm to countries across Europe and as far away as Afghanistan and Bolivia. In 2023, the ESB, which is owned by the private investment firm Perwyn, made more than 60 million Danish kroners, or about €8 million, in profit, a significant increase from the 35 million Danish kroners that it had made the previous year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Solo parent by choice" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Solo parent by choice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-60456992" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="60456992" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/60450931_605.webp" data-duration="04:34"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20220118_solomumENG_,sd_sor,sd_avc,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/je/je20220118_solomumENG_sd_avc.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business is a lucrative and rapidly growing one as more medical procedures become available and women opt to have children later in life, sometimes on their own or with same-sex partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Germany, donors, who typically donate once a week for six to 18 months, receive €80 per donation, the head of a sperm bank told DW. Their sperm is then washed, analyzed and packaged in so-called straws, longish tubes that are frozen in liquid nitrogen. Each straw sells for €1,000. Becoming &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/pregnancy/t-64950283"&gt;pregnant&lt;/a&gt; is an expensive and potentially protracted process: Though some women only need one or two tries, many might need 10 or more — and some never manage to conceive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fertility industry is governed by a patchwork of rules and regulations. Some countries place an age limit on treatments or only allow them for married heterosexual couples. Some allow procedures that are banned in other countries. Some allow anonymous donations of sperm and eggs, which others ban. German patients, for example, may travel to Spain for egg donations, which &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/german-doctors-want-human-egg-donations-to-be-legalized/a-49057057"&gt;are illegal in their home country&lt;/a&gt;; same-sex couples from Poland may travel to Germany for treatments they are denied back home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some countries place legal limits on the number of children born from one single donor. Others, like Germany, do not, but banks tend to follow industry guidelines of 15 families per donor. Though the European Union passed new regulations on medically assisted reproduction and substances of human origin in 2024, these do not include an EU-wide cap on the number of children born to a single donor. There is currently no international database that tracks donors and prevents them from selling sperm to several banks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="71835727" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/71835727_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="a magnified image of sperm as viewed through a microscope"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Donor sperm undergoes medical tests, yet TP53 is not included in the routine tests&lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: David Spears/Mary Evans/IMAGO&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential donors undergo extensive medical tests, and only a single-digit percentage &lt;a class="internal-link" href="/en/mobile-phones-might-cause-lower-sperm-count/a-67287821"&gt;make the cut&lt;/a&gt;. The process does not include screening for rare genetic mutations such as TP53. Having invested heavily in a donor, sperm banks have an economic incentive to maximize profit by selling each donor's sperm to several families. ​​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On its website, the ESB claims to have set a self-imposed cap on the number of families per donor: "The majority of our donors have a limit of 75 families, but in selected markets (the UK, Ireland, Australia and the Netherlands) we also offer donors with a worldwide limit of 25 families." For an extra fee, prospective buyers can limit the number of families; €39,000 buys exclusivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research by DW and its partners shows that the at least 197 children conceived with donor 7069's sperm clearly exceeded the ESB's own stated polices, as well as national limits in some cases. In Belgium alone, 53 children were conceived using the donor's sperm,​ ​despite national laws that set a limit of six women per donor. This has prompted investigations by Belgian authorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="vjs-wrapper embed big"&gt;&lt;h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Northern Cyprus clinics offer babies by design" class="headline"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 20 20"&gt;&lt;g fill-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Northern Cyprus clinics offer babies by design&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;video id="video-74839704" controls playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="74839704" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/74821788_605.webp" data-duration="26:04"&gt;&lt;source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/dwtv_video/flv/ej/ej251127_Gesamt_,AVC_480x270,AVC_512x288,AVC_640x360,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"&gt;&lt;source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/dwtv_video/flv/ej/ej251127_Gesamt_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;p class="vjs-no-js"&gt;To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that &lt;a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank"&gt;supports HTML5 video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confronted with the findings, the ESB wrote: "We are deeply affected by the case and the impact that the rare TP53 mutation has on a number of families, children and the donor. They have our deepest sympathy." The ESB "tests and performs an individual medical assessment of all donors in full compliance with recognized and scientific practice and legislation." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately," the ESB wrote in its statement, "we have identified that the limits for how many families a donor can be used for have been exceeded in some countries both in the specific case regarding TP53 and in other cases. This is partly due to inadequate reporting from the clinics, non-robust systems and fertility tourism." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her laboratory in central Berlin, Ann-Kathrin Klym did a double take when she heard the number of children conceived with donor 7069's sperm. It is, she said, "enormous." Klym heads the laboratory at the Berliner Samenbank, a sperm bank that, with its 10 employees, is a minor player compared with the ESB. Klym showed DW the bank's storage room: big, bulky containers filled with liquid nitrogen, which freezes the sperm. When she removed a lid to show the small straws with frozen sperm housed in each, whitish-grey nitrogen gas swirled out of the tank. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="placeholder-image master_landscape big"&gt;&lt;img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="75035269" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/75035269_${formatId}.jpg" data-aspect-ratio="16/9" alt="gloved hand pulls tube, or straw, of semen from a container featuring several such tubes"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="img-caption"&gt;Sperm is stored in liquid nitrogen. &lt;small class="copyright"&gt;Image: DW/EBU&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Klym said her bank limited donors to 15 families and asked them to sign a declaration that they had not sold sperm to another bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People conceived with donor sperm and their parents are calling for Europe-wide and indeed global caps on the number of children born to one donor. Spenderkinder, an association of donor-conceived children in Germany, told DW that it advocates for a global cap of six families per donor, as well as a global registry of donors. That would also make it easier to find and contact families in a timely manner should sperm banks become aware of diseases and mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-slot-id="Article_InContent-1" class="rich-text-ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;'I feel enormous guilt'&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mother in France who received the call back in June has since learned that her now-teenage daughter did inherit the mutation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, she and her daughter continue to grapple with what the diagnosis will mean: a lifetime of regular checks and the constant fear of what they might reveal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she harbored "absolutely no ill feelings" for donor 7069, whose sperm had been sold to scores of families across the continent by the European Sperm Bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, she said, he had not known that he was a carrier of the mutation: "He is not to blame." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, she said, "I feel enormous guilt — to know that because you chose to conceive that way, you have passed on something that is potentially life-threatening." It is, she added, "very, very hard." &lt;/p&gt;

However, the DNA in some of his cells mutated before he was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It damaged the TP53 gene – which has the crucial role of preventing the body's cells turning cancerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Most of the donor's body does not contain the dangerous form of TP53, but up to 20% of his sperm do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, any children made from affected sperm will have the mutation in every cell of their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This is known as Li Fraumeni syndrome and comes with an up to 90% chance of developing cancer, particularly during childhood as well as breast cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It is a dreadful diagnosis," Prof Clare Turnbull, a cancer geneticist at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, told the BBC.

However, individual countries do set their own limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The European Sperm Bank accepted these limits had "unfortunately" been breached in some countries and it was "in dialogue with the authorities in Denmark and Belgium".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In Belgium, a single sperm donor is only supposed to be used by six families. Instead 38 different women produced 53 children to the donor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The UK limit is 10 families per donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;'You can't screen for everything'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Allan Pacey, who used to run the Sheffield Sperm Bank and is now the deputy vice president of the Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health at the University of Manchester, said countries had become dependent on big international sperm banks and half the UK's sperm was now imported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He told the BBC: "We have to import from big international sperm banks who are also selling it to other countries, because that's how they make their money, and that is where the problem begins, because there's no international law about how often you can use the sperm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He said the case was "awful" for everybody involved, but it would be impossible to make sperm completely safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"You can't screen for everything, we only accept 1% or 2% of all men that apply to be a sperm donor in the current screening arrangement so if we make it even tighter, we wouldn't have any sperm donors – that's where the balance lies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;This case, alongside that of a man who was ordered to stop after fathering 550 children through sperm donation, has again raised questions over whether there should be tougher limits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology has recently suggested a limit of 50 families per donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, it said this would not reduce the risk of inheriting rare genetic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Rather, it would be better for the wellbeing of children who discover they are one of hundreds of half-siblings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"More needs to be done to reduce the number of families that are born globally from the same donors," said Sarah Norcross, the director of the Progress Educational Trust, an independent charity for people affected by infertility and genetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We don't fully understand what the social and psychological implications will be of having these hundreds of half siblings. It can potentially be traumatic," she told BBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The European Sperm Bank said: "It is important, especially in light of this case, to remember that thousands of women and couples do not have the opportunity to have a child without the help of donor sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It is generally safer to have a child with the help of donor sperm if the sperm donors are screened according to medical guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;What if you are considering using a sperm donor?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sarah Norcross said these cases were "vanishingly rare" when you consider the number of children born to a sperm donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;All of the experts we spoke to said using a licensed clinic meant the sperm would be screened for more diseases than most fathers-to-be are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Prof Pacey said he would ask "is this a UK donor or is this a donor from somewhere else?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If it's a donor from somewhere else I think it's legitimate to ask questions about has that donor been used before?

So when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness, numbness and difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech, a family member rushed him to a nearby stroke clinic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’ve never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” said Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Munshi is the senior author of a case report about the man, a warehouse worker from Sherwood, Nottingham, whose name was withheld to protect his privacy. The paper was published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Normal blood pressure for adults is less than 120 over 80 mm HG (millimeters of mercury). Blood pressure of 180 over 120 or higher is considered a medical crisis that requires immediate emergency care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“His left side was numb, and scans showed he had a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi said. “He was admitted, and we treated him with five different medications until his blood pressure dropped to 170.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back at home again, the man’s blood pressure continued to climb, reaching 220 despite numerous drugs. Munshi and his team searched for answers for weeks, running extensive tests that turned up negative. Then one day the man told Munshi about his energy drink habit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi said. (The brand name was withheld from the study.) “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some energy drinks can have up to 500 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 30 milligrams in tea and 90 milligrams in coffee, said study first author Dr. Martha Coyle, a resident doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the UK, guidelines suggest 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, between two and four cups,” Coyle said. “This gentleman was consuming 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams, three times the amount.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration also recommends no more than 400 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just weeks after stopping his consumption of the energy drink, the man’s blood pressure returned to normal. Today, years after the incident, he is healthy but still lives with the aftermath of his stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself,” the man told his doctors. “(I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after 8 years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combinations of ingredients ‘cause havoc’&lt;br&gt; It’s not just high levels of caffeine. Today’s energy drinks also contain blood pressure boosting ingredients such as the amino acid taurine, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Energy drinks that contain caffeine plus taurine produce significantly higher blood pressure than caffeine alone,” he said. “They also contain high levels of glucose — we know sugar damages the blood vessels in diabetes which leads to heart damage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy drinks also typically contain ginseng, which impacts metabolism, and guarana, a plant thought to contain caffeine at twice the concentration of a coffee bean, according to the study. Milder stimulants such as theophylline, found in cocoa, and theobromine, found in tea, are often included as well, Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such energy drinks can cause cardiac arrhythmias, damage the endothelium, the tissue that lines blood vessels, and aggregate blood platelets, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When platelets are aggregated, especially in the setting of high glucose, they can produce blood clots,” he said. “Young people are often willing to try energy drinks, especially in combination with other drugs such as cocaine or methylamphetamine, which have similar effects, and all of these drugs together can cause havoc.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical literature is full of examples of the harms of energy drinks, so this case, while startling, is not an isolated event, Munshi said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have seen other patients who developed an irregular heartbeat, what we call atrial fibrillation,” he said.” Another patient developed an intracellular hemorrhage in the brain, while yet another patient had a stroke in the brain due to a blood clot.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Munshi believes doctors need to become more aware of the impact of energy drinks and ask about use during regular checkups, “especially when people come at a younger age with cardiovascular problems or strokes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The nature of these drinks is changing. They have become more and more dangerous and more potent,” he added. “We propose increased regulation of energy drink sales and advertising campaigns, which are often targeted at younger ages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Wed, 10 Dec 2025 00:10:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxOMDE5bjU5MUVZZHluenFJa08xaVlhYk1DVjlDZkVwT0hQLXRQeTVGSVdZek00ZVRlS2Y4NXZaV0V2RWRCb3BDMFVUMzR4TnJLb0Noa0pNX2pROHJsOGpLTE50NllKcTdQLUN3czktaWFyYVZZSWFsRGh3bnZWNDJlY1Z1aW82SnVUc3h5eElvZzVJeDdjTjRCbzdIRmVuTDRPWXdWNWoyT0FUVi1XMkxrWXZhUEhtTGMwOGFsY1N3bUVMOTFLeFcyZQ</guid></item><item><title>秃鹫尸体在俄亥俄州学校外腐烂后怀疑是禽流感-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/09/us/dead-vultures-bird-flu-ohio.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 23:55:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBZSDNCTGRCUUR5b0hpZHdjY3dCMXE1OWNpbkFfX0lfTW1tdG1MRVh4Y05qMEZrYkREb2hiV0FSNDNnZDhNSlphaHZNNFpVRllaWk1felpwbjRzUERuTk1DM1oxTjZQUXpMLW1KWlhLSE1TVVZrTm13czVB</guid></item><item><title>医生在FIT 50岁后发出与能量饮料有关的中风警告- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/doctors-issue-warning-after-fit-50-year-old-gets-stroke-tied-to-energy-drinks-2000697325</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;If you’re a huge fan of energy drinks, you might want to listen up: a case study out today shows the perils of drinking too many of these caffeine-rich beverages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man in the UK developed a stroke likely caused by his habit of eight energy drinks per day, according to his doctors. Though the man ultimately recovered from the injury, he continues to have some lingering symptoms years later. The doctors say his case should offer an important lesson that these drinks aren’t necessarily harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Energy drinks are not currently widely seen as dangerous for cardiovascular risks—they have been discussed because of their effect on sleep and concentration, but the public has little awareness of the more hidden risks they pose,” study author Martha Doyle, a stroke doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;No other identifiable cause&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the paper, &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2025-267441"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in BMJ Case Reports, the man visited the hospital with sudden numbness on his left side and general unsteadiness. He also had a remarkably high blood pressure reading of 254/150. For context, 120/80 is normal blood pressure, while 180/120 and above is recognized as a “hypertensive crisis.” Tests soon confirmed he had experienced a mild stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The man was hospitalized for three days. He was discharged with medications to lower his blood pressure and prevent further stroke. Over the next three months of follow-up visits, he appeared to make an excellent functional recovery, though he continued to have some numbness. More worryingly, he still had incredibly high blood pressure despite his medication, and he was even readmitted to the hospital as a result. He was then given more antihypertensives.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finally, during a more detailed examination of his lifestyle, the man disclosed to doctors that he loved energy drinks. On average, he consumed eight drinks a day, each containing 160 milligrams of caffeine per serving. That amounts to about 1.3 grams of caffeine per day—over three times the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#Footnote"&gt;maximum recommended dose&lt;/a&gt; (400 milligrams) for a typical adult.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The man was fit and healthy for his age, with no major stroke risk factors like a history of smoking or current alcohol drinking. The doctors’ many tests also failed to find any clear precipitating cause for his stroke, other than his very high blood pressure. So given all that, it’s almost certain the man’s energy drink habit played at least a part in spiking his blood pressure and subsequently triggering his stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We attribute this patient’s stroke to the effects of his energy drink consumption because through thorough investigations using multiple diagnostic methods we ruled out any other identifiable cause,” Coyle said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the man agreed to quit energy drinks for good. Within a week, his blood pressure started to return to normal, and it remained healthy after he was weaned off the antihypertensives (yet more evidence that the drinks were to blame). Further follow-up visits showed that he made a complete recovery with no further strokes, and eight years later, his blood pressure continues to be normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, he does still experience some residual numbness to this day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I obviously wasn’t aware of the dangers drinking energy drinks were causing to myself, (I) have been left with numbness (in my) left hand side hand and fingers, foot and toes even after eight years,” the man wrote in a patient perspective accompanying the report.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A needed warning&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctors say that there are several reasons why energy drinks can raise the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular problems, mostly tied to the high amounts of caffeine and sometimes sugar found in them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from causing a chronic rise in blood pressure, for instance, too much caffeine might cause a sudden narrowing of blood vessels in the brain or trigger an arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). Some ingredients popular in these drinks, such as taurine and ginseng, might also amplify the effects of caffeine, while others like &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589113/"&gt;guarana&lt;/a&gt; can contain high amounts of undisclosed caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There have been some &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/21-year-old-man-nearly-dies-of-heart-failure-after-drin-1846699497"&gt;high-profile cases&lt;/a&gt; of cardiovascular disease tied to energy drinks. Between 2022 and 2023, for instance, at least two &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/panera-charged-lemonade-caffeine-second-death-lawsuit-1851080766"&gt;heart-related&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/business/panera-lawsuit-charged-lemonade-death/index.html"&gt;deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. were linked to Panera Bread’s highly caffeinated “Charged Lemonade” energy drinks. By mid-2024, Panera had &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/panera-says-phasing-controversial-charged-lemonade-rcna151058"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; the item from its menu, and earlier this summer, the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/panera-settles-remaining-lawsuits-highly-caffeinated-charged-lemonade-rcna217767"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; the remaining lawsuits over these deaths and other reported injuries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the report authors say that—much like their patient—the public still isn’t generally aware of the health risks these drinks can carry. And it’s possible that these risks could warrant increased regulation of these products or the advertising for them. Compared to something like alcohol, they note, energy drinks are frequently marketed to younger kids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Whether health authorities should be actively intervening we cannot definitively conclude from our reporting of just this case,” Coyle said. “However it would be beneficial to get this out there so if any similar cases exist they can be brought to attention. And also for the public, they have the right to know the risks of what they are consuming.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Speaking as someone who loves his morning and sometimes afternoon coffee, I’ll certainly be a bit more proactive in tracking my daily caffeine consumption from now on.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

So when he suddenly experienced left-sided weakness, numbness and difficulties with balance, walking, swallowing and speech, a family member rushed him to a nearby stroke clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His blood pressure was sky high — about 254 over 150 millimeters — yet when you looked at him you’ve never know it, because he looked so well. That’s why we call hypertension the silent killer,” said Dr. Sunil Munshi, a consulting physician at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munshi is the senior author of a case report about the man, a warehouse worker from Sherwood, Nottingham, whose name was withheld to protect his privacy. The paper was &lt;a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bcr-2025-267441"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal BMJ Case Reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings"&gt;Normal blood pressure for adults&lt;/a&gt; is less than 120 over 80 mm HG (millimeters of mercury). Blood pressure of 180 over 120 or higher is considered a medical crisis that requires immediate emergency care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His left side was numb, and scans showed he had a stroke in the deeper part of the brain, the thalamus, which explains the unsteadiness,” Munshi said. “He was admitted, and we treated him with five different medications until his blood pressure dropped to 170.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at home again, the man’s blood pressure continued to climb, reaching 220 despite numerous drugs. Munshi and his team searched for answers for weeks, running extensive tests that turned up negative. Then one day the man told Munshi about his energy drink habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each day he consumed eight highly potent energy drinks to stay alert for his job — two cans at four different times during the day,” Munshi said. (The brand name was withheld from the study.) “Each of the drinks contained 160 milligrams of caffeine. Suddenly the diagnosis was clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some energy drinks can have up to 500 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 30 milligrams in tea and 90 milligrams in coffee, said study first author Dr. Martha Coyle, a resident doctor at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the UK, guidelines suggest 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, between two and four cups,” Coyle said. “This gentleman was consuming 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams, three times the amount.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration also r&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much#:~:text=Daily%20Caffeine%20Consumption%20for%20Most,generally%20associated%20with%20negative%20effects."&gt;ecommends&lt;/a&gt; no more than 400 milligrams a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks after stopping his consumption of the energy drink, the man’s blood pressure returned to normal.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="first-letter"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ave you heard of Ozempic? This “miracle” weight-loss drug is all over social media. Television and radio ads are promoting it as the easy way to lose weight without changing your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even people who once preached body positivity now have obvious “Ozempic face.” Sunken eyes, gaunt cheeks and aging skin are signs of damaging attempts to change their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘Ozempic body’ is the new ‘heroin chic’ in the world of celebrity—and the fact that it’s trickling down to the masses should concern everyone,” the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/03/lifestyle/ozempic-body-pushes-celebs-to-shrink-its-not-shaming-to-call-it-what-it-is-shocking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote on December 3. “The thinness is alarming, and it could have catastrophic consequences for how younger generations view their bodies—and look after their health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic was not created as a weight-loss drug. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a Type 2 diabetes medication for altering blood sugar levels. But one side effect is appetite suppression, which can trigger rapid weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic’s other potential side effects include “nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach (abdominal) pain and constipation,” “low blood sugar,” “dehydration leading to kidney problems,” “severe stomach problems,” “serious allergic reactions,” “gallbladder problems,” “inflammation of your pancreas,” “changes in vision,” “possible thyroid tumors, including cancer.” That comes directly from the &lt;em&gt;Ozempic.com&lt;/em&gt; homepage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have a choice: quick weight loss with Ozempic and face a host of side effects—or eat better and exercise more. Many are choosing the former, and paying $1,000 a month to Novo Nordisk A/S for the privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrities, Instagram influencers and everyday Americans are celebrating their slimmed-down physiques while ignoring the dangers of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus vaccination era desensitized many Americans to perpetual cycles of booster shots. Now you can get a few more injections and experience “miracle” weight loss. What’s not to love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies of the American obesity crisis show that &lt;a href="https://www.tfah.org/report-details/state-of-obesity-report-2025/"&gt;40&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)01548-4/fulltext"&gt;75&lt;/a&gt; percent of the adult U.S. population is overweight or obese. While results vary depending on the studies’ definitions of obesity, one thing is certain: Our society has a serious problem with unhealthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump boasted during a December 2 cabinet meeting that his administration has lowered the price of Ozempic, Wegovy and other prescription “fat drugs for fat people.” He takes it for granted that making these pharmaceuticals more accessible to everyday Americans is an accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a tragedy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the president’s own Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has emphasized, the horrible health crisis suffered by the current generation of Americans is a &lt;em&gt;result,&lt;/em&gt; and it has a &lt;em&gt;cause.&lt;/em&gt; That cause is our indulgent and horrible health habits!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy and a few others are finally bringing at least some acknowledgement of the painful truth and some sanity regarding cause and effect to the federal government. But “make America healthy again” is still just a slogan if the president, the rest of the government and, much more importantly, the people continue to &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; ill health, then mask the &lt;em&gt;effects&lt;/em&gt; with pharmaceutical potions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[T]hou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness ….” That’s how Deuteronomy 32:15 describes the nations of Israel, which, in our generation, includes the Americans and the British, among others. This can apply literally, but the main meaning is that we are thickened and dulled in our &lt;em&gt;thinking.&lt;/em&gt; Even when our pharmaceutical “solutions” are forced to tell us up front that we are paying $1,000 per month for another dose of what effectively might be a carcinogen, we won’t stop indulging in excessive and rich foods, leisure, relaxation, entertainment and lack of exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want the easy road. We want the quick fix. We want the miracle drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battling obesity with drugs instead of the biblical principle of turning away from the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of obesity is thick, childish reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law &amp;amp; Liberty&lt;/em&gt; published an article last month titled “&lt;a href="https://lawliberty.org/the-great-infantilization/"&gt;The Great Infantilization&lt;/a&gt;,” arguing that our nation is led by men and women “who are chronological adults yet think and behave like toddlers: profoundly unreasonable, proudly irrational, and occasionally hysterical. … [T]here are now far too many overgrown children, both male and female, in positions of political and cultural power. This immaturity is affecting and infecting nearly all of our political and cultural institutions ….”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is right out of the pages of Bible prophecy: “And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable” (Isaiah 3:4-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God has taken away the wisdom, understanding and maturity from the adult population. Verse 12 continues, “As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, &lt;em&gt;they which lead thee cause thee to err&lt;/em&gt;, and destroy the way of thy paths.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father writes in &lt;a href="/1232-no-freedom-without-law"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Freedom Without Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; “All the leaders are like little children in their reasoning. They rule like ‘babes.’ … Children are guided solely by emotions—unless they are guided by a wise adult. But here in Isaiah, &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;the children rule&lt;/span&gt;, guided mainly by their emotions. And children are naturally lawless! &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Our leaders have never grown up emotionally&lt;/span&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood’s worshipful fascination with Ozempic bodies and pointed ignoring of “Ozempic face” encapsulates a dangerous problem in our society. Chasing short-term benefits with no care for the future is childish reasoning with serious consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men” (1 Corinthians 14:20).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second time Paul wrote “children” in that sentence, he used a different Greek word that means “infant.” Be like an infant in malice and evil, but as the Bible margin says, you must be of a &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;ripe age&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;perfect&lt;/span&gt; in understanding. The &lt;em&gt;Greek Interlinear&lt;/em&gt; translates the verse: “Brothers, be not children in the minds, but in malice be like infants, and &lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;in mind, be mature.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must couple the infant-like innocence of evil with the mature understanding and wisdom of a wise adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mature mind understands that you cannot engage in the causes of bodily harm (physical sin) without the effects of bodily harm. Nor can you engage in spiritual sin without the effects of spiritual sin. But so many of us think in this immature and dangerous way!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible provides clear guidelines for healthy thinking and healthy physical living. Herbert W. Armstrong emphasized seven important laws of radiant health: Eat healthy food, and drink pure water; cleanliness; get enough sunshine and fresh air; exercise; get enough sleep and rest; ensure proper elimination; have a positive mental attitude. These laws require &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt;—replacing bad behaviors like unhealthy eating and a sedentary lifestyle with right behaviors like eating whole foods and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dozens of Bible verses show that God is the only source of physical healing. But just like spiritual healing, physical healing requires repentance—a 180-degree change in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: There is no shortcut to health. You must work to build good habits into your routine. Good health requires building character and willpower. Knowing the laws is not enough. You must obey them, and that requires battling human nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God wants us to “prosper and be in health” (3 John 2). But drugs are not the route to vigorous, radiant health. America’s leaders should end this madness. Instead, the Trump administration has made these drugs more affordable and accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ozempic cult is a symptom of our societal sickness. We are a nation of legal adults who reason like overgrown children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul describes his own path to mature reasoning in 1 Corinthians 13:11: “When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be fooled by the quick-fix Ozempic mentality. Instead, rely on the sure Word of God to build vibrant physical and spiritual health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quarantine period for measles is 21 days from the exposure, which is the maximum incubation period before the tell-tale rash appears. Measles is highly infectious, with up to 90 percent of unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable people contracting the virus upon exposure. People infected with measles are infectious from four days before the rash appears to four days after its onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is occurring in the northern region of South Carolina, with many cases identified in Spartanburg County, which contains Inman, as well as Greenville County. Both counties have low vaccination rates. For the 2024–2025 school year, only 90 percent of Spartanburg students were vaccinated, while Greenville’s vaccination rate was 92.4 percent. Those numbers are well below the 95 percent target needed to halt community transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two counties’ low vaccination rates are coupled with high rates of religious exemptions. Spartanburg has the state’s highest rate, with 8.2 percent of students exempt from the school vaccination requirement based on religious beliefs. Neighboring Greenville has a religious vaccination exemption rate of 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 111 outbreak cases, 105 were unvaccinated, three were partially vaccinated, two had an unknown status, and one case was fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a national scale, vaccination rates have declined overall amid misinformation spread by anti-vaccine activists, including current Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. As such, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;measles cases&lt;/a&gt; are at a 33-year high, with nearly 2,000 cases this year and 46 outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was updated to correct the year the US eliminated measles. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;It’s normal for parents, or anyone, to have questions about vaccinations -- but what happens if your pediatrician urges a shot that’s &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-rfk-gold-standard-science-research-autism-6e4c6bc2534252ab1e7add0942043778"&gt;under attack by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s getting more likely: The nation’s leading doctors groups are in an unprecedented standoff with federal health officials who have attacked long-used, lifesaving vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revolt by pediatricians, obstetricians, family physicians, infectious disease experts and internists came to a head when an advisory panel handpicked by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. urged an &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-babies-hepatitis-b-10f8db54beb38c5cd39a94f8a3657752"&gt;end to routine newborn vaccination&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against hepatitis B, a virus that can cause liver failure or liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That vaccine saves lives, helped child infections plummet and has been given safely to tens of millions of children in the U.S. alone, say the American Academy of Pediatrics and other doctors groups that vowed Tuesday to keep recommending it.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only difference. That Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices now is examining possible changes to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-kennedy-trump-covid-fda-novavax-b50f4d6fbcca378eb89b059bc8a91477"&gt;the entire childhood vaccination schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, questioning certain ingredients and how many doses youngsters receive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pushing back, the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued its own recommendations for youngsters. Other medical groups — plus some city and state public health departments that have banded together — also are issuing their own advice on certain vaccines, which largely mirrors pre-2025 federal guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Infobox" data-module data-gtm-region="This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We owe our patients a consistent message informed by evidence and lived experience, not messages biased by political imperative,” Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, told reporters Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;But Nahass acknowledged the inevitable consumer confusion, recounting a relative calling him last weekend for advice about hepatitis B vaccination for her new grandbaby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans don’t have a Cousin Ronnie to call. They are left alone with fear and mistrust,” he said, urging parents to talk with their doctors about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;New guidelines without new data concern doctors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B isn’t the only vaccine challenge. Kennedy’s health department recently changed a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-autism-vaccines-7b1890f626dd5921fafd00fdd1e6425a"&gt;vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Federal agencies also moved to restrict COVID-19 vaccinations this fall, and are planning policy changes that could &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-prasad-memo-fda-rfk-jr-7cf543476ab3867b25a47463c9c5c144"&gt;restrict future flu and coronavirus shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to vaccine advice, “for decades, ACIP was the gold standard,” said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel once routinely enlisted specialists in specific diseases for long deliberations of the latest science and safety data, resulting in recommendations typically adopted not only by the CDC but by the medical field at large, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week’s meeting of Kennedy’s panel, which includes vaccine skeptics, marked a radical departure. CDC specialists weren’t allowed to present data on hepatitis B, the childhood vaccine schedule or questions about vaccine ingredients. Few of the committee members have public health experience, and some expressed confusion about the panel’s proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;At one point, a doctor called in to say the panel was misrepresenting her study’s findings. And the panel’s chairman wondered why one dose of yellow fever vaccine protected him during a trip to Africa when U.S. children get three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is designed to protect children for life from a virus they can encounter anywhere, not just on a trip abroad. And other scientists noted it was carefully studied for years to prove the three-dose course offers decades of immunity — evidence that a single dose simply doesn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they’ve got new data, I’m all for it — let’s see it and have a conversation,” said Dr. Kelly Gebo, an infectious disease specialist and public health dean at George Washington University, who watched for that. “I did not see any new data,” so she’s not changing her vaccine advice.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Committee members argued that most babies’ risk of hepatitis B infection is very low and that earlier research on infant shot safety was inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially unusual was a presentation from a lawyer who voiced doubt about studies that proved benefits of multiple childhood vaccines and promoted discredited research pointing to harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think at any point in the committee’s history, there was a 90-minute uninterrupted presentation by someone who wasn’t a physician, a scientist, or a public health expert on the topic — let alone someone who, who makes his living in vaccine litigation,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy expert at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By abandoning data and the consensus of front-line doctors, the ACIP is “actively burning down the credibility that made its recommendations so powerful,” added Stanford’s Scott. “Most parents will still follow their pediatricians, and AAP is holding the line here. But the mixed messages are precisely what erode confidence over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Parents already have a choice — they need solid guidance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump administration health officials say it’s important to restore choice to parents and to avoid mandates. That’s how the panel’s hepatitis B recommendation was framed — that parents who really want it could get their children vaccinated later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents already have a choice, said Dr. Aaron Milstone of the American Academy of Pediatrics. The government makes population-wide recommendations while families and their doctors tailor choices to each person’s health needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many doctors don’t — or can’t — do their own lengthy scientific review of vaccines and thus had relied on the ACIP and CDC information, Yale’s Schwartz noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They “rely on trusted expert voices to help navigate what is, even in the best of times, a complicated landscape regarding the evidence for vaccines and how best to use them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a role that the pediatricians and other doctors groups, plus those multistate collaborations, aim to fill with their own guidelines — while acknowledging it will be a huge task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, “ask your questions, bring your concerns and let us talk about them,” said Dr. Sarah Nosal, of the American Academy of Family Physicians, urging anyone with vaccine questions to have an open conversation with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

Early reports show a fast-moving wave of infections that is already sending vulnerable individuals to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, infection levels remain low in most regions, yet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wastewater Surveillance System data shows flu activity rising in more than three dozen states as of early December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CDC is warning that this flu season could be as bad as last year's flu season, which was the worst on record on hospitalizations and severe disease,” said Shereef Elnahal, president of Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, during a recent press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dawn Nolt, an infectious disease expert at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University raised concerns of how the strain this flu season could have on the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't have that many beds,” Nolt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“So one bed that's needed to treat a child with a respiratory illness is one less bed for the child who has to recover from surgery from appendicitis, who needs treatment for a bleeding disorder, or for the child who decides to take up skateboarding in the middle of winter and has a fracture."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="YouTubeEmbed_youTubeEmbed__ygKv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregon officials are watching the situation closely. Howard Chiou, medical director at the Oregon Health Authority, emphasized that while hospitalization and test positivity rates are currently typical for this point in the season, both indicators are trending upward. Given influenza’s rapid mutation rate, Chiou urged residents to get vaccinated rather than wait for clearer signs of severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t wait for an accident to put the seat belt on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine uptake, however, remains a concern. Roughly 1 million Oregonians—about 23% of the state—have received a flu shot so far, a figure approximately five percentage points lower than last year. Officials attribute the decline partly to the broader rise in vaccine skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising case numbers in several states hint at the strain’s disruptive potential. Massachusetts has observed a sharp acceleration in activity, with flu-related hospitalizations more than doubling in just two weeks. In Iowa, an “extremely high” rate of illness forced the Moulton-Udell school district to close for two days and cancel athletic events after nearly 30% of students and staff became sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the CDC estimates that between 1.9 million and 3.3 million Americans have contracted the flu since October, with as many as 38,000 requiring hospitalization. Some hospital systems—including those in New Jersey and California’s Sonoma County—have reinstated mask requirements to protect high-risk patients during the respiratory virus season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts note that although this year’s influenza season appears to be starting earlier, an early onset does not necessarily predict a more severe peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 22:22:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1wFBVV95cUxNd1Mxdk5PTTIySld0ZW04UGlZSkhfMUVSSlJMaWl0Q0pkb2p5VHkyOEdCS2hWS3NIVW5aMXVUY3B6Tk4tMnMzbFU4V19PSnF0NUN1b1R2cEx2UjJUeUpSMzJWeVJ5VVB4YjdwMEVuQlBjRWUwTndiWEF1Z05jNlA5anVLWG1LZElnR2FNS1k5Vnp4TmNwMUZsOVpVaEp0VHFTd0FVVFNrY21EQkQtM2F5dWVDbUVSV1N1ZjBvZlBUOUNxZ1dKOXNjQ29IcWNOeUVvRXlPY2lxQQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养专家的说法，你永远不应该空腹喝的6种饮料-非常简单</title><link>https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-not-to-have-on-empty-stomach-11865387</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-article-intro_1-0" class="comp mntl-article-intro mntl-block article-content__description"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re between meals or just waking up, consuming certain beverages can irritate your stomach if you haven't eaten in a while. Below, we asked experts which &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-that-are-not-as-healthy-as-they-seem-11746821" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinks you should avoid&lt;/a&gt; on an empty stomach, plus what to do when you’re craving that first sip of coffee or soda but need to eat something first.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some people swear by &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/new-study-says-coffee-can-help-you-live-longer-11748513" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drinking coffee&lt;/a&gt; to boost their mood and concentration. In addition, this breakfast staple can protect against &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455881/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;diabetes and certain types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. But when you haven’t eaten in a while, drinking coffee, especially black coffee, can be tough on your stomach. “Since coffee contains chlorogenic acids, it’s highly acidic and stimulates the stomach to produce even more acid,” says &lt;a href="https://www.sacredheart.edu/phonebook/jacqueline-vernarelli.php" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Jacqueline A. Vernarelli&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, nutritional epidemiologist, public health nutritionist, and associate professor at Sacred Heart University. “Coffee can increase gastric motility (speed of digestion), which can irritate the stomach lining.” Moreover, having coffee on an empty stomach can lead to acid reflux, heartburn, anxiety, jitters, shakiness, and a faster heart rate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For some people, drinking coffee can help &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11769125" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;jumpstart their bowel movements&lt;/a&gt;, while it can have the opposite effect on others, especially if they regularly consume &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40600201/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high amounts of caffeine&lt;/a&gt;. “If you’re prone to acid reflux, you definitely don’t want to be drinking coffee on an empty stomach,” says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Amanda Sauceda&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, registered dietitian and gut health nutritionist.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that you don’t have to give up your morning brew. Vernarelli suggests adding a splash of milk or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/are-plant-based-milks-better-for-you-8628856" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based milk&lt;/a&gt; to lower the acidity of coffee and slow caffeine absorption. “The best alternative is to drink water, or eat a small snack like a banana, yogurt, or a slice of toast before your coffee,” she says. If you wake up not feeling hungry, Sauceda recommends starting with half a cup of coffee or switching to decaf to see if it makes a difference. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sorry to pile on if you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/is-it-better-to-start-your-day-with-coffee-or-tea-11759735" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;caffeine-lover&lt;/a&gt;, but swapping coffee for tea won’t soothe an empty stomach. “The caffeine in tea can increase gastric acid production,” says &lt;a href="https://www.wowmd.com/pages/kristen-carli?utm_source=direct" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristen Carli&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, dietitian from WOWMD. When this happens, you might notice symptoms like nausea, acid reflux, and stomach cramping.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As with coffee, another concern is the temperature of your tea. Drinking tea that is too hot can irritate the lining of your esophagus and stomach. Besides allowing your beverage to cool, Carli recommends avoiding strong teas that are made by &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/how-to-steep-tea-7153209" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;steeping the tea&lt;/a&gt; longer or using tea bags with crushed leaves to release the flavor more quickly. Before having tea, try eating a high-fat or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-protein-snacks-8584150" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein snack&lt;/a&gt;, like a hard-boiled egg, yogurt, oatmeal, or whole-grain bread. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@721f542d" data-item-index="2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The distinctive pop and fizz you hear when opening a can of soda is like premium ASMR. But what it does for your ears doesn’t translate to your stomach, unfortunately. &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-sodas-at-the-supermarket-11719818" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carbonated drinks&lt;/a&gt; like cola and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/shopping-storing/beverages/sparkling-water" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt; get their fizziness from carbon dioxide, which expands into gas when it reaches your stomach, Carli says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “This gas continues to build and rise unless there’s food in the stomach to prevent it,” she explains. “When the gas rises, it brings with it stomach acid that can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554462/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;contribute to reflux&lt;/a&gt;.” Reflux occurs when stomach acid flows backward into your esophagus, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/how-many-times-should-you-chew-your-food" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;heartburn&lt;/a&gt;, which is a burning sensation in your chest. Along with reflux, you may experience symptoms like bloating and burping. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To prevent reflux, it’s best to limit or skip carbonated drinks. “Avoid drinking carbonated drinks until after you’ve eaten,” Carli says. But if you decide to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/drinks-ruining-your-teeth-11795347" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;drink something fizzy&lt;/a&gt; before eating, sip it slowly and stay upright for at least 30 minutes to help with digestion. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block-adslot_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block" item="freemarker.template.DefaultMapAdapter@2c1032bc" data-item-index="3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-citrus-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Citrus Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These juices are made from citrus fruits like oranges, lemons, and grapefruit. Despite being a delicious &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/orange-juice-benefits-8684680" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;source of vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, citrus juice is high in citric acid and sugar. “The acidity of orange juice can irritate the stomach lining, which can be an issue if you have ulcers,” Sauceda says. She adds that drinking orange juice can trigger or worsen symptoms of acid reflux. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Aside from being acidic, citrus juice contains a lot of sugar. “The &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/low-sugar-fruits-7481285" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sugar found in fruit&lt;/a&gt; isn’t inherently bad for you, but it can spike your blood sugar, leading to cravings or energy crashes.” Moreover, when you haven’t eaten anything, drinking citrus juice can lead to cramping, nausea, and the post-spike &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-that-make-you-tired-8738277" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sugar crash&lt;/a&gt;, Vernarelli says. This crash refers to a sudden drop in blood sugar that can make you feel dizzy, tired, or irritable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you enjoy a glass of juice in the morning, make sure to eat something with it. Vernarelli recommends having a few bites of protein or &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/high-fiber-foods-11690551" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, such as nuts, yogurt, or eggs, before drinking juice to help stabilize your blood sugar. “Personally, I find that something starchy can help settle my stomach when I have orange juice,” Sauceda says. She’s also a fan of &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/surprising-ingredient-that-makes-smoothies-creamier-11726758" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;making a smoothie&lt;/a&gt; to help your gut tolerate juice better.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When you’re &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/how-to-boost-energy" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fighting the urge to yawn&lt;/a&gt;, you might be tempted to reach for an energy drink. “These drinks often have extremely high caffeine levels and are full of sugar, which can spike blood glucose levels,” Vernarelli says. Even sugar-free options often contain high amounts of caffeine. Whether your drink comes in a 16-oz. can or a 2-oz. energy shot, your body tends to absorb these beverages more quickly without food. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, “energy drinks commonly contain additives like &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/taurine-benefits-8690088" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;taurine&lt;/a&gt;, guarana, and niacin, which can cause nausea when taken without food,” Vernarelli says. Her advice is to consume these drinks with a protein-rich snack, such as nuts, cheese, yogurt, or eggs. These foods can help slow caffeine absorption and &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-upset-stomach-8720850" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;reduce gastrointestinal distress&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you’re &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/favorite-brunch-recipes" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;having brunch&lt;/a&gt; mimosas (minus brunch) or evening cocktails, alcohol is bad news if it’s been hours since your last meal. “Alcohol is absorbed very quickly through the stomach lining,” Carli says. “Without food in the stomach to slow that process, the levels of alcohol in your blood can rise quickly.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The result can be rapid intoxication and a burning sensation in your stomach. She explains that alcohol can irritate the stomach lining because it increases gastric acid secretion. Similar to juice, alcohol can also interfere with your body’s ability to &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-alcohol-to-drink-8391763" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;regulate glucose&lt;/a&gt;, leading to low blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To avoid these unpleasant effects, Carli recommends eating a balanced meal first. This means filling your plate with vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. She also suggests choosing drinks with a &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/holidays-entertaining/entertaining/food-drink/alcohol-content-wine" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower alcohol content&lt;/a&gt; and drinking water between alcoholic beverages to reduce stomach irritation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Gout is often blamed on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alcohol-can-trigger-serious-cardiac-effects-in-young-people"&gt;overindulgence in alcohol&lt;/a&gt; or unhealthy eating, but research suggests genetics plays a much bigger role in the painful arthritic condition than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, an international team of scientists looked at genetic data collected from 2.6 million people across 13 different cohorts of DNA data. That number included 120,295 people with "&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;prevalent gout&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing the genetic codes of people with the condition to those of people without, the team found 377 specific &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)"&gt;DNA regions&lt;/a&gt; where there were variations linked to gout – 149 of which hadn't been associated with the disease before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-revive-20-million-year-old-gene-to-help-fight-gout"&gt;Scientists Revive 20-Million-Year-Old Gene to Help Fight Gout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While lifestyle and environmental factors are certainly still in play, the findings suggest genetics is a major driver of gout risk – and the researchers think there may be more undiscovered genetic links still to be found, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gout is a chronic disease with a genetic basis and is not the fault of the sufferer – the myth that gout is caused by lifestyle or diet needs to be busted," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Tony Merriman from the University of Otago in New Zealand, when the study was published last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/gout/"&gt;Gout takes hold&lt;/a&gt; when there are high levels of uric acid in the blood, which then form sharp crystal needles in the joints. When the body's immune system starts to attack those crystals, it leads to significant pain and discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics is important in every stage of that process, the researchers suggest. Particularly, it affects the likelihood of the body's immune system attacking the crystals, and in the way &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uric_acid"&gt;uric acid&lt;/a&gt; is transported around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gout can come and go, but there are treatments available – and the authors behind the study think misconceptions can put people off getting those treatments. That's a real problem with cases of the condition &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrrheum.2015.91"&gt;rising and rising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This widespread myth causes shame in people with gout, making some people more likely to suffer in silence and not go and see the doctor to get a preventive drug that lowers urate in the blood and will prevent their pain," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of giving us a better understanding of the causes of gout, the study provides scientists with more options to explore when it comes to treatments, particularly in terms of managing the body's immune response to the buildup of uric acid. In fact, existing drugs could be repurposed for this job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151682" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png" alt="Huge Study Shows Where Gout Comes From, And It Isn't What We Thought" class="size-medium wp-image-151682" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-642x693.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-385x415.png 385w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-768x828.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002-600x647.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/Gichtfuss_im_Roentgenbild_002.png 1016w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151682" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gout on X-rays of a left foot in the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe.

Nevertheless, it gives us a much better sense of a health problem that's been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diseases-dickens-might-find-familiar-are-making-a-comeback-following-uk-s-austerity"&gt;afflicting people for centuries&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope that, in time, better and more accessible treatments will become available with the new targets we identified," &lt;a href="https://www.otago.ac.nz/news/newsroom/study-busts-myths-about-cause-of-gout"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Merriman. "Gout deserves more health-spend resources and greater prioritization in the health system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-024-01921-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2024. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If you've noticed that one drink hits you harder than it used to, you're not alone. It's part of the natural aging process, and it may be your body doing you a favor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AILSA CHANG, HOST: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's the holidays, and for many people that means more parties and more occasions for alcoholic drinks. NPR's Maria Godoy reports on how alcohol can hit harder as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Once upon a time, a drink or two went down the hatch with no problems. Now it's a recipe for misery. Sound familiar? Dr. Monica Christmas of the University of Chicago Medicine says it's a common lament as people enter middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONICA CHRISTMAS: You are not alone. I am in that age range, too, and absolutely it needs to be spread out or it's all going to go straight to my head and I will need to sleep half the day away the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: There are physiological explanations for why our ability to tolerate alcohol wanes with age. For one thing, the liver enzymes that break down alcohol become less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTMAS: And so that means that our bodies metabolize alcohol a little bit differently. And we also lose more muscle as we get older, and that muscle is replaced by fatty tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: That's important because muscle stores water, which dilutes alcohol in our blood. Having less muscle mass means alcohol will hang around in our bodies longer, says Johannes Thrul. He's an alcohol and substance abuse researcher at Johns Hopkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOHANNES THRUL: And so what this means is that the same drink that previously maybe felt just fine now leads to a higher blood alcohol level. You feel the effects for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: These changes happen to both men and women as they enter middle age. But for women in perimenopause, Christmas says alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms that come with hormonal fluctuations, like mood swings and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRISTMAS: Alcohol is - already is known to be a depressant. It can also increase baseline anxiety symptoms. Alcohol can disrupt sleep too. If you're already experiencing all of those symptoms, it's just that much more compounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: While worse hangovers might not sound like a good thing, think of it as your body nudging you in the right direction. Geriatrician Ken Koncilja with the Cleveland Clinic says the risks of drinking alcohol increase with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEN KONCILJA: Things like liver disease, increased risk of diabetes, high blood pressure very much can be exacerbated. Memory problems - alcohol use can cause dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: It can also interfere with many medications and lead to balance problems and more falls. And drinking alcohol raises the risk of several types of cancer. Koncilja says he makes it a point to discuss the benefits of cutting back with his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KONCILJA: And these conversations about alcohol use, being proactive with people in their 50s and 60s has huge impact for their health and well-being when they're in their 80s and 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GODOY: Johannes Thrul of Johns Hopkins says while the healthiest option is to not drink at all, even small changes to cut back can reap health benefits. During holiday parties, he says, try alternating alcoholic drinks with mocktails, and drink plenty of water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THRUL: Why don't you just give it a try and see how it feels?

Nearly 800 New Yorkers were hospitalized with the flu that week, up 93% from the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1isr3"&gt;State officials are urging New Yorkers to get vaccinated against the flu, as well as against COVID and RSV, as they prepare to gather with friends and family for the winter holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3qoq5"&gt;"We expect a more severe flu season due to circulating strains of the virus compared to last year,” state Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c299l"&gt;"Gathering with loved ones is what this season is all about,” McDonald continued. “Vaccines ensure we have the best protection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fjk8q"&gt;About 3.4 million New Yorkers had gotten their flu shots for the season as of mid-November, a slight drop from the same period last year, when 3.5 million flu shots had been given out statewide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="48l34"&gt;State data shows COVID vaccination has also dropped 30% so far this season compared with the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="evjph"&gt;A period of confusion over access to the shots ensued this fall amid a shift in federal guidance. Gov.

    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Avoid 'brain' supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From fish oils to vitamins and softgels claiming to boost memory, every pharmacy seems to be selling the next miracle pill to boost your brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Landsverk cast doubt on these claims, saying that, realistically, no pill could replace someone doing the basics of eating well and exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told Daily Mail: 'To prevent dementia, you do need to look at changing your habits, as opposed to taking a pill and still having your steak and fries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On the list was brain supplements, which they said were not likely to boost cognitive health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'None of these supplements have been proven to be helpful. None of them have proven efficacy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because they are sold as supplements, they do not go through safety or efficacy testing and do not need to be proven effective in studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Landsverk also raised concerns over potential contaminants in neurological-related supplements that could harm someone's brain rather than boost its health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/3822"&gt;2020 study by the American Academy of Neurology&lt;/a&gt; that tested 10 supplements bearing names such as 'nootropics', 'smart drugs' and 'cognitive enhancers' detected prescription drugs in them that were not approved for use in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs included two analogs of piracetam, a prescription drug used to improve brain function approved in Europe that has not been approved in the US because of little evidence it is effective, and phenibut, a nervous system depressant that has been linked to addiction, reduced consciousness and breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Failing to wear glasses or use hearing aides when needed was also a factor, the researchers said (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't go without your glasses or hearing aids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 75 percent of Americans need some form of vision correction, while around 15 percent, mostly older adults, need a hearing aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But surveys suggest that many who need these inventions avoid them, either because of concerns over their appearance, habit or a refusal to admit either has deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Langa warned, however, that not using these could raise the risk of someone suffering from dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'There is increasing evidence around making sure things like hearing troubles or vision problems are addressed to help prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There are two main theories why these may be a risk; One is that, as people have more trouble with hearing and vision, they kind of stop interacting with the world a bit more and, by doing that, they are more socially isolated, and we know that social isolation is a risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The other potential pathway would be the idea that, because the brain is receiving less input due to a vision or hearing impediment, the brain is stimulated less and this somehow injures or harms the brain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that less stimulation of the brain may weaken connections between neurons in the organ, raising the risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2813302#:~:text=Results%20The%20study%20population%20comprised,more%20high%2Dquality%20longitudinal%20studies."&gt; 2024 study&lt;/a&gt; involving 573,000 people, including 40,000 with hearing loss, found that those who had hearing loss but were not using hearing aids had a 20 percent higher risk of dementia compared to those without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those who had hearing loss but were using the devices, they had a six percent higher risk of dementia compared to those without the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There was also a warning over living in cities, with experts saying the pollution, noise and lack of green spaces could affect someone's health (Above is Bangkok, Thailand)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Choose your home wisely&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many are attracted to the big city for job opportunities, higher salaries and the chance to mingle with a wide variety of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Langa warned that these 'concrete jungles', where about 80 percent of the US population live, could raise someone's risk of suffering from dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Elizabeth Landsverk, shown above, also warned over the risk factors that could raise someone's risk of suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'There is increasing evidence that pollution exposure in life may increase the risk for cognitive decline and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Additionally, the amount of traffic, noise, your ability to get outside into say, parks or green space where you are able to do physical activity and interact with friends, all of those seem to have an important impact on your risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have previously suggested that pollution may raise the risk of dementia because it leads people to breathe in more fine particles that can enter the circulatory system and be carried to the brain, where they damage brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being in a neighborhood with few green spaces or meeting points may also pose a risk, researchers suggest, because someone may have fewer opportunities to socialize with friends or a community or stimulate their brain through vigorous physical activity, which can also raise their risk of suffering from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts also recommended that people should get the shingles vaccine, which studies have suggested may be able to reduce someone's risk of suffering from dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Don't skip the shingles vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shingles vaccine is recommended for all adults aged 50 years or older, but estimates suggest less than 40 percent get the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Ken Langa, an internist and dementia researcher at the University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine protects against the chickenpox virus, which remains dormant in the body for decades after an infection and can be reactivated, often in later life when the immune system is weaker. About 1 million Americans get shingles every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Langa told Daily Mail that the vaccine could also have a second, unexpected, use; preventing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The shingles vaccine prevents or decreases the risk that the [chickenpox] virus gets reactivated and, therefore, decreases the amount of inflammation that your body is exposed to and has to fight off the virus again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Certainly, one theory is that because the vaccine will decrease the likelihood of having a shingles episode, it decreases the likelihood of the body having high inflammation, and the nerves in the brain sort of benefit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/03/shingles-vaccination-dementia.html"&gt;study published in July&lt;/a&gt; last year found that, out of 100,000 adults tracked, those who received the shingles vaccine were 20 percent less likely to develop dementia over the next seven years than those who did not receive the shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is a stock image of a tick biting a human. In some cases, Lyme disease may also raise someone's risk of being diagnosed with dementia (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Watch out for tick bites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in 10 Americans are bitten by a tick every year, and nearly half a million people are diagnosed with Lyme disease annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is treated with antibiotics, but can cause brain fog, headaches, memory issues and drooping on one side of the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, amid anecdotal cases, experts are looking into whether the tick-borne disease may also be a risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jessica Zwerling, a neurologist at the Montefiore Hudson Balley Center of Excellence for Alzheimer's Disease in New York City, said: 'Lyme disease can raise the risk of arthritis, and a different type of brain disease when it comes to dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Langa said: 'It would not be top of my list, maybe five or six paragraphs down, but there is evidence to suggest that this could raise the risk of dementia.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said that Lyme disease may raise the risk of dementia by causing inflammation in the body, which could disrupt nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Alzheimer's Society says online that there is now increasing evidence to suggest a potential link between dementia and Lyme disease, but that it is not yet enough to say that it can cause the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It adds: 'In rare cases Lyme disease can also affect the brain, causing dementia-like symptoms. With early treatment, this is reversible.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Society cited a 2023 case study of a man who developed a form of dementia years after suffering from Lyme disease, although said it was not clear whether the two were connected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 20:56:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNdXk2OHJzTkluMXRoUjJrWGpDd3FyLW5fOHpObW0xbE9iRzV6dHlmS0xqYWkyaDkyZTNsVmhqNXBYbXJKVUxlOUxIeU5uNnM0dklFdzRKb0VDcm9KUm5XT3dERUxPRU5aa3puQzktQ1FwZndmbm9QZnJPa19oSktSWG1zZ1U1WGZuTzU4amlB0gGTAUFVX3lxTFBNMURZUjdsRnUxamNzVTU0RHZFRnRzTjlKQ0wwZ0Z2QkVqck1nU21RR2ttelpnZFFaQzloMzNpNVFIaEhaNHVRNk1VYzI2emhuM0JqeG1OY3FrQjlvYVhURmRUMTZEMFJyb3h6OFlBbC11MU5HY1F0aDc4MmNueXNDLUVsRE80Y000LUlOUXRYY2pTdw</guid></item><item><title>大蒜漱口水？科学说是- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/garlic-mouth-wash-the-science-says-yes-2000697393</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It turns out that in addition to keeping vampires away, garlic might also have decent mouthwashing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of researchers has conducted a review of past studies regarding garlic extract’s potential as an antimicrobial mouthwash compared to chlorhexidine, the current standard. While further research is necessary, they concluded that it can indeed serve as a viable alternative, particularly in higher concentrations. The side effects described by the researchers, however, failed to address what a garlic-based mouthwash would mean for one’s romantic life. Maybe that’ll be for the next review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A natural alternative?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial mouthwashes are used to treat bacterial, fungal, and viral oral diseases impacting the mouth’s hard or soft tissues. Patients can use them for gingivitis, cavities, periodontal diseases, and even halitosis—a.k.a. bad breath.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Chlorhexidine is widely used as a gold standard mouthwash but is associated with side effects and concerns over antimicrobial resistance. Garlic (&lt;em&gt;Allium sativum&lt;/em&gt;), known for natural antimicrobial properties, has emerged as a potential alternative, though clinical evidence remains limited,” the researchers, all from the University of Sharjah’s College of Dental Medicine, wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2210803325000648?via%3Dihub"&gt;review article&lt;/a&gt; published this fall in the Journal of Herbal Medicine. “This systematic review compares the antimicrobial efficacy of garlic extract with chlorhexidine in clinical practice, assessing its viability as a herbal substitute,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;From an initial pool of over 400 articles, the team narrowed the selection down to five, and their review revealed that higher concentrations of garlic extract mouthwash exhibited antimicrobial capabilities comparable to chlorhexidine. Chlorhexidine is a common synthetic antimicrobial agent effective in different medical and dental contexts. Garlic, the vegetable virtually everyone knows and loves, is frequently used as an herb and spice and is one of the strongest naturally occurring antibacterial and antifungal crops. While garlic extract can cause side effects, they’re usually less intense than side effects linked to synthetic chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, “the effectiveness varied based on mouthwash concentration and duration of application, contributing to differences in outcomes,” the researchers wrote. “Some studies favored chlorhexidine for maintaining higher plaque/salivary pH, while others reported garlic extract to be more effective at certain concentrations. However, garlic mouthwash may cause greater discomfort.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Side effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The papers reported side effects such as a burning sensation and unpleasant odor. Unsurprisingly, this might impact people’s inclination to drop chlorhexidine for a vampire-resistant alternative. Garlic extracts, however, are more easily accessible than chlorhexidine and similar synthetic agents, which usually necessitate a prescription. They are commonly accessible in a number of over-the-counter health products. What’s more, mouthwash with garlic extract seems to have more lasting residual effects than chlorhexidine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, “garlic extract mouthwash demonstrated clinical antimicrobial effectiveness, with significant reductions in bacterial counts from baseline,” the researchers explained. Their review indicates that, in certain situations, garlic extract mouthwash could be a possible alternative to antiseptics and disinfectants such as chlorhexidine, which remains the gold standard mouthwash.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These studies have contributed to understanding the antimicrobial role of garlic extract in comparison to synthetic agents like chlorhexidine,” they continued. However, “further clinical studies with larger samples and longer follow-up are needed to confirm effectiveness and improve clinical applicability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone also needs to check in on the potential for garlic breath.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;When Alessandro Barbera was rushed to a California hospital with infant botulism in October, his father had barely heard of the disease, never mind the rare and costly treatment that likely saved the newborn’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, however, Tony Barbera is deeply grateful for BabyBIG, the sole antidote to the paralyzing and potentially deadly illnesses linked to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/byheart-formula-infant-botulism-recall-79edcb5ad02cfc5391f3e120cf7c9584"&gt;contaminated ByHeart infant formula&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is hugely remarkable,” said Barbera, 35, whose son is slowly recovering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/byheart-baby-formula-botulism-recall-98ad391ac5606c980a012d35f5f7637c"&gt;botulism outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; tied to ByHeart formula has sickened at least 39 babies across in 18 states &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/byheart-infant-formula-botulism-recall-9971f57a2a218eac4fba53f305dcba3c"&gt;since August&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and showed the value of the treatment made from blood plasma donated by a small group of scientists and other volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is almost like a miracle,” said Dr. Vijay Viswanath, a pediatric neurologist at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, who has treated several children with botulism during his career — including one in the current outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“Prior to the discovery of BabyBIG, some of these hospitalizations would take two or three months,” Viswanath said, if infected children recovered at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licensed in 2003, BabyBIG is the brand name for human botulism immune globulin, an IV medication that uses antibodies from volunteers vaccinated against botulism to help babies too young to fight the disease on their own. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Treatment relies on donors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment was the brainchild of the late Dr. Stephen Arnon, who was a scientist with the California Department of Public Health. In 1976, Arnon and colleagues identified the rare form of botulism that affects infants younger than 1 — and then spent his 45-year career figuring out how to treat it. The disease occurs when babies ingest botulism spores that germinate in the intestine and produce a dangerous toxin that attacks the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 3,700 children worldwide have been treated with BabyBIG since Arnon and his team conducted a pivotal clinical trial in California in 1997 that showed the medication could shorten hospital stays and reduce the need for breathing machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Produced in small batches every five years, BabyBIG costs nearly $70,000 per treatment, according to the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which Arnon founded. Under state law, fees from the sale of the drug are used only to fund the botulism program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication relies on donors like Nancy Shine, a 76-year-old retired biochemist in California who was vaccinated against botulism because she worked with the lethal germ in a lab. Arnon first recruited Shine and other scientists for the BabyBIG project two decades ago because their blood produced high levels of antibodies, the blood proteins that neutralize the botulism toxin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The early protocol required the volunteers to receive boosters doses of an investigational botulism vaccine also used by the U.S. military and then undergo a procedure that harvests the blood plasma that contains antibodies against botulism types A and B. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was not very pleasant to be vaccinated with,” Shine recalled. “There were a lot of side effects, like big welts where you got vaccinated and a little bit of pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Still, Shine contributed to three batches of the antitoxin produced between 2008 and 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s probably the highlight of my career that I actually was able to participate in this project and donate plasma,” Shine said. “We made a product that could save infants’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Development faced hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because infant botulism is rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, finding funding and other resources to develop the BabyBIG treatment took nearly 15 years and $10.6 million — and faced substantial hurdles, Arnon noted &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17403850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in a 2007 article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, about 30 people on average provide plasma for each batch of BabyBIG, California health officials said. Batch 8, the latest edition, is being manufactured now at a Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. plant near Los Angeles, according to Giles Platford, president of the company’s plasma-derived therapies unit. The company contracts with California officials to produce BabyBIG on a “not-for-profit basis,” Platford said. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Some of the earliest donors, like Shine, have aged out of the BabyBIG program, which collects blood from adult volunteers up to age 70. New donors are accepted, but they must enroll in a clinical study directed by the California health department and agree to receive a booster dose of a different investigational botulism vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California officials estimate they have enough BabyBIG in reserve to last until next summer, based on current projections. The ByHeart outbreak is part of a worrisome rise of at least 107 infant botulism cases treated in the U.S. since August, said Dr. Jessica Khouri, senior medical officer for the state program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shine recently received a booklet filled with photos and letters from families whose children have recovered from botulism after receiving BabyBIG. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really wonderful. I read a couple each day,” she said. “Every single one of them makes you want to cry.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

&lt;p id="ad76ee2c-13c2-4bea-8d5a-ce6c6b0bb414"&gt;Scientists think a very common childhood infection may be linked to bladder cancer — and now, they're figuring out the chain reaction that connects the two diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's known that people who get kidney transplants are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2173578621000755?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2173578621000755?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;three times more likely&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to develop bladder cancer than the general population. Researchers have hypothesized that because transplant patients are immunosuppressed, dormant viruses lurking in the body are given the opportunity to reactivate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ad76ee2c-13c2-4bea-8d5a-ce6c6b0bb414-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;These sleeping pathogens include &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ukkidney.org/rare-renal/patient-information-0/bk-nephropathy" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ukkidney.org/rare-renal/patient-information-0/bk-nephropathy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BK virus (BKV)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also called human polyomavirus type I, a common cold virus that 95% of people pick up as children. After an infection, the virus then lies dormant in the kidney. This introduces a question: Can the BK virus cause cancer years after it infects someone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="04304490-1c29-492d-b8cb-a389329a9faa"&gt;In a study published Dec. 3 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aea6124" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aea6124" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science Advances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers showed that the virus can cause the type of DNA damage that is also seen in bladder cancer that occurs later in life. But instead of finding DNA mutations directly caused by the virus, the researchers found that the culprit was the body's own immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a nicely-done laboratory study to show a possible way that BKV could have a larger role in bladder cancer than previously thought," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.path.pitt.edu/people/patrick-s-moore-md-mph" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.path.pitt.edu/people/patrick-s-moore-md-mph" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Patrick Moore&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tumor virology researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-ccda8030-c0fc-469b-aa67-36388106a9ce" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="connecting-the-dots-3"&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="d9010262-405e-4dd5-8fd5-a36aa045bbf8"&gt;There are several types of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/can-viruses-cause-cancer" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/can-viruses-cause-cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;viral infections that can lead to cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Normally, these enzymes help form the body's first-line defense against viruses and other pathogens. "They have these signatures from APOBECs, and we know APOBECs are part of the antiviral host defense," Baker explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker and his team took healthy human bladder cells and infected them with the BK virus in lab dishes. They found that the cells not only exhibited mutations similar to those seen in bladder cancer but also boosted the activity of APOBEC3, an enzyme that damages viral genomes in response to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="f0e5849b-46a2-484e-a3b1-a4cef781e9a4"&gt;When the scientists turned off APOBEC3 and then infected the cells with the BK virus, the DNA damage didn't occur. This finding suggests that the enzyme made by the host cell was causing the damage, not the virus itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers found increased APOBEC3 expression and cancer-like genetic mutations in nearby "bystander" cells that hadn't been infected with the virus. So, a cell doesn't have to contain the actual virus to accumulate genetic mutations caused by an infection elsewhere in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was a surprise," Baker said. "But the reason it makes perfect sense is that … bladder cancers don't have viruses in them." This finding starts to unravel the connection between early-life viral infections and cancers diagnosed decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-07a975ec-4651-4d1e-9745-0e91a83d8579" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-starting-point-3"&gt;A starting point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a50d178e-2a61-41a1-a186-70795c51de77"&gt;Although these initial data are impactful, Moore said he would like to see whether patients with bladder cancer are infected more often with the BK virus than people without the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is intriguing," he said, "but only a starting point and work needs to be done to show its actual importance to human cancer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person contracts the BK virus in childhood, they generally experience common cold symptoms before recovering. The virus then stays inactive, or &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0882401016300389?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0882401016300389?via%3Dihub" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dormant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in the kidney, bladder and tubes between the two organs.

                                        The research published in the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/nutrition-research-reviews/article/an-overview-of-national-and-international-long-chain-omega3-polyunsaturated-fatty-acid-intake-recommendations-for-healthy-populations/2B7F6FD161EE90A7472B2B20909C4926"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrition Research Reviews&lt;/em&gt; journal&lt;/a&gt; points to a mismatch between public health guidance and what people actually consume. They also note that the recommendations themselves are inconsistent and confusing the world over. "To close that gap, we need easier, sustainable ways to get these important nutrients—like foods enriched with omega-3s or supplements," says the University of East Anglia's Anne Marie Minihane.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        The most commonly recommended intake for adults is 250mg per day of combined EPA and DHA, with pregnant women advised to get an extra 100mg to 200mg of DHA. The recommended levels can be met by eating more oily fish or taking supplements, though the researchers acknowledge that dietary preferences and sustainability concerns can get in the way. Per &lt;a href="https://nutraceuticalbusinessreview.com/study-links-higher-omega-3-levels-lower-suicidal-thoughts"&gt;Nutraceutical Business Review&lt;/a&gt;, a different &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12944-025-02689-1"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that higher omega-3 levels have been tied to a reduced risk of suicidal ideation.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

Five deaths have also been reported. Both Nassau and Lee County have recorded no fatalities this year. Lee has registered four cases, while Nassau has only registered one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, at least 72 cases have been recorded across 12 states in 2025, mostly in the South, although one infection was also reported as far north as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/massachusetts/index.html" id="mol-a66f7670-d509-11f0-bb8f-917bb609b4fd"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Louisiana has seen a major uptick in Vibrio, with 26 infections and five deaths reported so far this year, well above the seven to 10 infections recorded annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vibrio are bacteria that naturally live in coastal waters, but are found in higher numbers from May to October when water temperatures rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Genevieve Gallagher, 49, caught Vibrio vulnificus after swimming at a beach off Florida's coast. She was hospitalized and doctors warned she was going into organ failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of an infection include skin redness or a rash that quickly becomes swollen or painful, fluid-filled blisters, fever, pain and an altered mental state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases, patients may need to have limbs amputated or the bacteria can enter the blood and cause the life-threatening condition sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About one in five people infected with the bacteria die from the disease, the CDC says, and about 80 percent are hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with weakened immune systems, older adults or those eating raw seafood are most at risk for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida revealed the two new cases in an update to its statewide data on December 5, but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state health department warns online: 'Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacteria in warm, brackish water. Water and wounds do not mix. Do not enter the water if you have fresh cuts and scrapes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Florida's case and fatality tally from Vibrio is below last year's, when a total of 82 infections and 19 deaths were recorded. In 2023, the state registered 46 infections and 11 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, the US recorded at least 82 cases and 19 deaths in 2024, also above the tally for this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Gallagher is pictured above before her infection, left, and while in the hospital.

The pain is unbelievable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gallagher believes the bacteria entered her body through a 'small cut' on her left leg, which she said she had a waterproof bandage on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treated her by removing most of the muscle on her left leg up to the knee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ben West, 38, was diagnosed with Vibrio vulnificus, a severe bacterial infection that can cause kidney and liver failure.

He added, however: 'I handled the fish, and they're wet and slimy. Any, you know, it's possible that I got slime and I scratched my leg. I mean, I don't remember. I'll never know.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To treat a Vibrio infection, doctors may use antibiotics, which can clear the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Physicians may also drain fluid from blisters and provide intravenous fluids.

						The "Shaking Palsy."Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used in an essay more than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was the first to identify and document the condition now known as Parkinson's disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in our brain's reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well as executive function (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.By 2021, public health researchers  reported there were almost 12 million cases worldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson's is projected to top 25 million by 2050. The disease not only substantially burdens the individual, but also takes a toll on their family, their community and society as a whole."We're now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer's disease — that should grab everybody's attention," neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.Parkinson's disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a way to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test."It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn't just a disease of dopamine; it isn't just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs," said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson's Foundation. "So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?"Genetics plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: environmental toxins — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and the chemicals with which we regularly come in contact."We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don't have to live in a world where we think it's inevitable to get Parkinson's," Okun said. His latest book on the disease, "The Parkinson's Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment," cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals that quietly assail our bodies.You can listen to the full episode here.What can you do to reduce your chances of getting Parkinson's? Okun has a list of 25 tips in his book, and these are his five favorites.Drink clean waterInvest in a carbon water filter for your kitchen sink, Okun said via email."A simple carbon filter can reduce the invisible toxicants that sneak into drinking water and may stress vulnerable brain systems," he said. "Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle."These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals like trichlorethylene, or TCE, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almost complete ban of TCE, but lawsuits have so far stayed the rule's effective start date under certain circumstances.)Breathe clean airUse air purifiers both at home and work."Removing fine particulate matter from indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson's," Okun said. "Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain's front door."Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE. Volatile organic compounds are gases that can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals can cause problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation and damage to the liver, kidney and central nervous system, the federal agency said.Eat clean foodTake the time to wash your fruits and vegetables, even if they are organic."Rinsing and scrubbing your produce … helps remove pesticide residues that can quietly injure mitochondria over time," Okun noted. "This simple daily habit lowers the exposure load your brain and nervous system must manage."And just as you would when washing your hands, you should rinse them for more than 20 seconds, Okun added.Keep your body movingExercise every day. Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson's disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder."Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (around 7,000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day," Okun said via email. "Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression."For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.Get enough sleepPrioritize  consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night."Deep sleep activates the brain's built-in cleaning system, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day," Okun said. "Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson's."Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson's Disease; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.

						The "Shaking Palsy."Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used in an essay more than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was the first to identify and document the condition now known as Parkinson's disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in our brain's reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well as executive function (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.By 2021, public health researchers  reported there were almost 12 million cases worldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson's is projected to top 25 million by 2050. The disease not only substantially burdens the individual, but also takes a toll on their family, their community and society as a whole."We're now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer's disease — that should grab everybody's attention," neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.Parkinson's disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a way to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test."It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn't just a disease of dopamine; it isn't just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs," said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson's Foundation. "So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?"Genetics plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: environmental toxins — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and the chemicals with which we regularly come in contact."We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don't have to live in a world where we think it's inevitable to get Parkinson's," Okun said. His latest book on the disease, "The Parkinson's Plan: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment," cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals that quietly assail our bodies.You can listen to the full episode here.What can you do to reduce your chances of getting Parkinson's? Okun has a list of 25 tips in his book, and these are his five favorites.Drink clean waterInvest in a carbon water filter for your kitchen sink, Okun said via email."A simple carbon filter can reduce the invisible toxicants that sneak into drinking water and may stress vulnerable brain systems," he said. "Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle."These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals like trichlorethylene, or TCE, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almost complete ban of TCE, but lawsuits have so far stayed the rule's effective start date under certain circumstances.)Breathe clean airUse air purifiers both at home and work."Removing fine particulate matter from indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson's," Okun said. "Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain's front door."Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE. Volatile organic compounds are gases that can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

In mouse experiments, they found that these cells responded to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; damage either by ceasing to grow and divide — leading to gray hair — or by replicating uncontrollably to ultimately form a tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad7d9898-316d-4c2b-b6bf-007d5d6eb77e"&gt;The findings, reported in October in the journal&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_4002302599642402687&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41556-025-01769-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fgray-hair-may-have-evolved-as-a-protection-against-cancer-study-hints" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-025-01769-9" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41556-025-01769-9&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fageing%2Fgray-hair-may-have-evolved-as-a-protection-against-cancer-study-hints" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Nature Cell Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underline the importance of these sorts of protective mechanisms that emerge with age as a defense against DNA damage and disease, the study authors say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-16b50d28-a674-4bcc-aad6-f7a3e53d2d81" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="graying-hair-as-cancer-defense-3"&gt;Graying hair as cancer defense &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="5bb196ab-96b9-487e-b73f-507350295916"&gt;Healthy hair growth is dependent on a population of stem cells that constantly renews itself within the hair follicle. A tiny pocket within the follicle contains reserves of melanocyte stem cells — precursors to the cells that produce the melanin pigment that gives hair its color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every hair cycle, these melanocyte stem cells will divide and produce some mature, differentiated cells," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.sgul.ac.uk/dot-bennett" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.sgul.ac.uk/dot-bennett" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dot Bennett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cell biologist at City St George's, University of London who was not involved in the study. "These migrate down to the bottom of the hair follicle and start making pigment to feed into the hair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graying occurs when these cells can no longer produce sufficient pigment to thoroughly color each strand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ksVhsp8PbtHfP6RDqKuDoS" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ksVhsp8PbtHfP6RDqKuDoS slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a sort of exhaustion called cell senescence," Bennett explained. "It's a limit to the total number of divisions that a cell can go through, and it seems to be an anti-cancer mechanism to prevent random genetic errors acquired over time propagating uncontrollably."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the melanocyte stem cells reach this "stemness checkpoint," they cease to divide, meaning the follicle no longer has a source of pigment to color the hair. Ordinarily, this occurs with old age as the stem cells naturally reach this limit. However,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aging-regeneration/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/aging-regeneration/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Emi Nishimura&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of stem cell age-related medicine, and colleagues at the University of Tokyo were interested in how this same mechanism operates in response to DNA damage — a key trigger for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/viruses-infections-disease/cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cancer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse studies, the team used a combination of techniques to track the progress of individual melanocyte stem cells through the hair cycle after exposing them to different harmful environmental conditions, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/ionizing-radiation" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/ionizing-radiation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ionizing radiation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and carcinogenic compounds. Intriguingly, they found that the type of damage influenced how the cell reacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ionizing radiation caused the stem cells to differentiate and mature, and ultimately activated the biochemical pathway responsible for cell senescence. As a result, the melanocyte stem cell reserves were rapidly depleted over the hair cycle, thus halting the production of further mature pigment cells and leading to gray hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, by essentially switching off cell division, this senescence pathway prevented the mutated DNA from passing into a new generation of cells, thus lowering the likelihood of those cells forming cancerous tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exposure to chemical carcinogens — such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/GB/en/product/sigma/d3254" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/GB/en/product/sigma/d3254" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tumour initiator widely used in cancer research — appeared to bypass this protective mechanism. Instead of switching on senescence, it toggled on a competing cellular pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="53a902ed-cd55-4ae4-ac21-91f9620410a6"&gt;This alternative chemical sequence blocked cell senescence in the team's mouse studies, enabling the hair follicles to retain their stem cell reserves and the ability to produce pigment, even after DNA damage. That meant that the hair retained its color, but in the long term, the unchecked replication of damaged DNA led to tumor formation and cancer, the team said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/imsut/en/about/press/page_00079.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal that the same stem cell population can meet opposite fates depending on the type of stress they're exposed to, lead study author Nishimura said in the statement. "It reframes hair graying and melanoma [skin cancer] not as unrelated events, but as divergent outcomes of stem cell stress responses," Nishimura added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step will be to translate this understanding into human hair follicles, to see whether these observations in mice carry over to people, Bennett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mb-6" id="e1897105-2585-44b3-a7d1-e6eebd501436"&gt;

No worker should have to suffer from a chronic and insidious lung disease or possibly die because of a preventable exposure at work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Cutting, polishing, or grinding stone can generate silica dust, which can cause silicosis if breathed into the lungs, health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Historically, silicosis was associated with mining and construction, but in recent years, the disease has become more prevalent among stone fabrication workers due to the rise in popularity of countertops made from engineered stone, which contains significantly more silica than other types of stone, according to state health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;While this is the first confirmed silicosis case in Massachusetts, officials cautioned that other unconfirmed cases could exist, pointing to a growing number of cases recently reported in other states and countries linked to the stone countertop fabrication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-read-more-8" class="taboola-read-more-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;“The confirmation of this case in Massachusetts is a tragic reminder that silicosis is not just a distant threat – it is here, and it is seriously impacting the health of workers in Massachusetts,” Emily H. Sparer-Fine, Director of DPH’s Occupational Health Surveillance Program, said in a statement. “Beyond the critical role employers play, everyone involved in the supply chain – from consumers and designers to contractors – can help reduce the danger by opting for materials that contain less silica and pose fewer health hazards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Most cases of&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;silicosis are work-related, and it’s very rare for silicosis to occur outside of workplace exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Early symptoms of silicosis include an irritating cough, mucus, and shortness of breath. As the disease progresses, people may have difficulty breathing and can experience fatigue, chest pain, leg swelling, and blueish lips. Silicosis also increases the risk for other lung diseases, such as lung cancer and tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Goldstein and Sparer-Fine recommended a slew of precautions stone countertop fabrication employers should take, including wet cutting and wet sweeping, proper ventilation, and enrolling workers in a medical surveillance program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;The first reported case of silicosis in the United States associated with exposure to silica dust from engineering stone was identified in Texas in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Download the &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/have-new-device-get-our-free-boston-25-news-weather-apps/PDC6X7UKOFDBVPV5YJHG3CX36I/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;FREE Boston 25 News app&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; for breaking news alerts.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph"&gt;Follow Boston 25 News on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Boston25News/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boston25"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. | &lt;a href="https://www.boston25news.com/video/live-stream/" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Watch Boston 25 News NOW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="default__StyledText-sc-tl066j-0 fcApnw body-paragraph body-copyright"&gt;©2025 Cox Media Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boston 25 News</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 17:03:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>生病时生个热辣的婴儿是个好主意吗？ -《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/09/is-hot-toddy-whiskey-remedy-good-when-sick</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-hdpgoq"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The hot toddy has a reputation as a folk remedy for illness. And if you’re sick, a steaming cup of whiskey, honey, lemon, and water can sound like a lot more fun than crackers and broth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But what about the alcohol? Here’s what experts say about hot toddies and colds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-i-have-a-hot-toddy-when-im-sick" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I have a hot toddy when I’m sick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Overall, it’s not a great idea, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Patients sometimes bring up hot toddies as a cold remedy, says Jesse Bracamonte, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, Arizona. Indeed, some of the ingredients can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Hot fluids, honey, and a little bit of lemon can be very therapeutic in combating a respiratory infection,” says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But there’s an important exception: “I would never recommend having alcohol with any illness,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":7,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is love addiction real – and what does it look like?","elementId":"59efc4b2-afa6-43ab-99b5-d2f50c2d0b01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/dec/02/love-addiction-explained"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While drinking can cause a relaxing effect, consuming alcohol while sick can also overly sedate you, particularly if you’re taking cold and cough medications like Benadryl, Bracamonte says. Combining alcohol with medications that have sedative effects can &lt;a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/health-professionals-communities/core-resource-on-alcohol/alcohol-medication-interactions-potentially-dangerous-mixes" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increase risks&lt;/a&gt; like falling and overdose, and change how you metabolize prescriptions – people over 65 need to be especially cautious because of their slower metabolism. (Even outside hot toddy season, it’s essential to chat with your doctor about potential alcohol-medication interactions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alcohol may also weaken the immune system and slow down healing, Bracamonte says. Furthermore, drinking can cause dehydration, worsening symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The last thing you want to do when you have a cold is get dehydrated,” says Joan Blake, a registered dietician and clinical instructor at Boston University. “If you take in something that is going to dehydrate you, it’s sort of like filling a bucket with a hole in the bottom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It’s also likely that if you’re not feeling well, you’re not eating much. Drinking alcohol on an empty stomach can cause blood sugar levels to drop, says Blake. Low blood sugar can lead to dizziness. In particular, people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic need to monitor their blood sugar, Blake explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-good-about-a-hot-toddy" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s good about a hot toddy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you take the booze out of the equation, a non-alcoholic hot toddy could help with a cold, says Bracamonte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Lemon contains vitamin C, which can support the immune system, says Blake. Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8264544/#B133" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests consuming vitamin C may slightly shorten the duration of the common cold (though you would probably need to consume at least &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279544/#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;200 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;; an orange has &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/sources-of-vitamin-c" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;about 83 milligrams&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://ebm.bmj.com/content/26/2/57" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4264806/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/571638#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; honey can help reduce cough frequency and discomfort. “A little bit of honey for a cough goes a long way,” says Bracamonte. A small amount of sugar, like the amount in a dollop of honey, can provide some necessary energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-16" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hydration helps with illness, especially &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4022-upper-respiratory-infection" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;upper respiratory infections&lt;/a&gt; like colds, explains Bracamonte. Staying hydrated &lt;a href="https://mydoctor.kaiserpermanente.org/mas/news/five-ways-water-can-help-you-stay-healthy-1758946" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;helps your cells&lt;/a&gt; maintain a strong immune system, reduces the likelihood of headaches, and loosens mucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-eat-or-drink-to-help-with-a-cold" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you eat or drink to help with a cold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you’re intrigued by the idea of the hot toddy, Blake recommends adding ginger because of its anti-inflammatory components and swapping in apple cider to replace the whiskey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if you don’t have an appetite, it’s still important to consume a small amount of sugar, “so you can have some kind of fuel,” Blake explains. A Gatorade or its equivalent could be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Bracamonte also recommends chamomile tea as a soothing beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As for food, a 2010 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3023145/#abstract1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that eating fruits and vegetables is associated with a 20% reduction in the number of days of moderate or severe common cold symptoms. Blake also recommends classic chicken noodle soup: It is hydrating and contains a healthy balance of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Ultimately, it’s important to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest, says Bracamonte.

                &lt;p&gt;An Ohio elementary school recently became the site of an animal massacre you’d expect to see at the start of a horror movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staff and students at St. Bernadette’s School in Clermont County discovered 72 dead vultures on campus after returning from the Thanksgiving holiday break. It took days and mounting media pressure before state wildlife officials responded to the school’s pleas and agreed to collect and test the potentially diseased carcasses. And as it turns out, some of the birds have since tested positive for avian influenza, though the risk of infection to the public is considered low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Initially ignored&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The birds were found on campus December 1, according to local media outlet WCPO 9. School staff contacted the fire chief at Pierce Township, who reached out to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR). Despite the clear possible danger of bird flu, ODNR officials initially declined to help, saying it wasn’t part of the agency’s usual duties.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“They were very adamant that they were not coming. There was a recommendation that you just take them, put them in a bag, double-bag them and throw them in the garbage,” Pierce Township Trustee Allen Freeman &lt;a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/i-team/we-dont-know-why-the-birds-have-died-72-vultures-dead-at-clermont-county-school"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; WCPO 9. After WCPO 9’s investigative team contacted the ODNR about the situation, however, the agency changed its tune. Last Friday morning, wildlife officials arrived to collect the birds.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bird die-offs can happen for various reasons, but one of the most concerning potential culprits is a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza (HPAI). Remarkably, though, the ODNR still wasn’t planning to test the collected birds for flu—at least initially.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In a statement to WCPO 9, an ODNR spokesperson said that since some wild birds in the county had earlier tested positive for HPAI, all subsequent large die-offs (six or more dead birds) are presumed to be carrying the disease. However, a spokesperson for Clermont County Public Health stated that the department would indeed arrange for the testing of two birds. On Monday, the results came back, showing a presumptive positive for bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A low risk, for now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is a serious and growing public health threat. Experts worry that an HPAI strain can eventually evolve to spread widely between humans while causing severe illness—a combination ripe for causing the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This danger has become all the more present in the U.S. since last year, when a strain of H5N1 bird flu started to spread widely among dairy cows and other mammals. At least 71 people in the U.S. have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html"&gt;caught&lt;/a&gt; H5N1 as well, while two are thought to have died from it. Just last month, a person in Washington exposed to wild birds and backyard chickens &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/first-human-dies-of-rare-h5n5-bird-flu-strain-heres-what-you-need-to-know/"&gt;also died&lt;/a&gt; of bird flu, albeit a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/first-ever-human-case-of-h5n5-bird-flu-found-in-washington-2000686941"&gt;different strain&lt;/a&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For now, human cases of H5N1 and other bird flu strains remain relatively rare, and the overall risk to the public is low. But the more people are exposed to infected wild birds or other carriers, the greater the chance that one day, we might not be so lucky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s all the more important to minimize these exposures as much as possible. And that’s also why it’s probably not the best idea to tell an elementary school that a bunch of dead birds isn’t a big deal to clean up on its own.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

He was soon hospitalized, ventilated and then died. Postmortem testing confirmed rabies, the CDC report said, baffling authorities because the recipient’s family had said he had not had any exposure to animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Doctors then reviewed records about the kidney donor, a man in Idaho, and discovered that in the Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) questionnaire he said he had been scratched by a skunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When asked, the family explained that a couple of months before, in October, while he was holding a kitten in a shed on his country property, a skunk approached, showing “predatory aggression toward the kitten”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The man fought off the animal in an encounter that the report says “rendered the skunk unconscious”, but not before the man received a “shin scratch that bled”, although he did not think he had been bitten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Five weeks later, a family member said, he became confused, had difficulty walking swallowing and walking, experienced hallucinations and had a stiff neck. Two days later, he was found unresponsive at home after a presumed cardiac arrest. Although he was resuscitated and hospitalized, he never regained consciousness, and after several days was “declared brain dead and removed from life support”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report states that several of his organs, including his left kidney, were donated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After rabies was suspected in the kidney recipient, authorities went back to test laboratory samples from the donor; they tested negative for rabies. But biopsy samples directly from his kidneys did detect a strain “consistent with a silver-haired bat rabies”, suggesting that he had, in fact, died of rabies and had passed it on to the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The investigation suggested a “likely three-step transmission chain” in which a bat infected a skunk, which infected the donor, whose kidney then infected the donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC said it was only the fourth reported transplant-transmitted rabies event in the United States since 1978. It noted that the risk for any transplant-transmitted infection, including rabies, is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;After discovering that three people also received cornea grafts from the same donor, authorities immediately removed the grafts and administered Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent infection. The three people remained asymptomatic, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC report stated that in the US, family members often provide information about a prospective donor’s infectious disease risk factors, including animal exposures. Rabies is typically “excluded from routine donor pathogen testing because of its rarity in humans in the United States and the complexity of diagnostic testing”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In this case, hospital staff members who treated the donor were initially unaware of the skunk scratch and attributed his pre-admission signs and symptoms to chronic co-morbidities,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/06/health/rabies-death-skunk-kidney-transplant.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lara Danziger-Isakov, the director of immunocompromised host infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, described the incident as “an exceptionally rare event”, adding that “overall, the risk is exceptionally small”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOWnhPUGlzVGYzT3Mycl8yYjFIWGYyODNseUxPdnhqMVFlLTZma0tXdDVqSC1UNnpnNi05d2VVSWZ1Um5DUUF6Z2FTUEVTemM5QzhOVkE4SXhZVEpicW5nbEZEU1pySzFWd2s0VG9uV0xqTmlOSkxMeHdlNkxLVENwRk1uZjd3NUk</guid></item><item><title>睡眠不足强烈预测预期寿命缩短-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/sleep-life-expectancy-30028/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new nationwide analysis shows that getting fewer than seven hours of sleep a night is one of the strongest predictors of shorter life expectancy across U.S. counties. Sleep sufficiency outperformed other behavioral factors—including diet, exercise, and loneliness—with only smoking showing a stronger association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings reveal a consistent year-to-year correlation between sleep duration and lifespan in nearly every state.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a behavioral driver for life expectancy, sleep stood out more than diet, more than exercise, more than loneliness — indeed, more than any other factor except smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t expect it to be so strongly correlated to life expectancy,” said senior author Andrew McHill, Ph.D., associate professor in the OHSU School of Nursing, the OHSU School of Medicine and OHSU’s Oregon Institute of Occupational Health Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always thought sleep is important, but this research really drives that point home: People really should strive to get seven to nine hours of sleep if at all possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted primarily by graduate students in the Sleep, Chronobiology and Health Laboratory of the OHSU School of Nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have broadly understood the importance of sufficient sleep for a variety of positive health outcomes. However, McHill and co-authors said they were surprised by the strength of the connection to life expectancy. The effect of insufficient sleep swamped the impact of diet and exercise as a predictor of life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s intuitive and makes a lot of sense, but it was still striking to see it materialize so strongly in all of these models,” McHill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a sleep physiologist who understands the health benefits of sleep, but the strength of the association between sleep sufficiency and life expectancy was remarkable to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although previous research has shown broadly that lack of adequate sleep leads to higher mortality risk, the new research is the first to reveal year-to-year correlations between sleep and life expectancy for every U.S. state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of modeling, the CDC defined sufficient sleep as at least seven hours a night, which is recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found clear correlations in each year and in most U.S. states between sleep and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statistical analysis did not delve into reasons why inadequate sleep appears to shorten life expectancy, but McHill noted that sleep influences cardiovascular health, the immune system and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research shows that we need to prioritize sleep at least as much as we do to what we eat or how we exercise,” he said. “Sometimes, we think of sleep as something we can set aside and maybe put off until later or on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting a good night’s sleep will improve how you feel but also how long you live.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to McHill, co-authors include lead author Kathryn E. McAuliffe, B.S., Madeline R. Wary, B.S., Gemma V. Pleas, B.A., Kiziah E.S. Pugmire, B.S., Courtney Lysiak, B.A., Nathan F. Dieckmann, Ph.D., and Brooke M.

Moreover, sleep insufficiency was significantly associated with lower life expectancy when controlling for traditional predictors of mortality, with only smoking displaying a stronger association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate the importance of adequate sleep in all communities regardless of income level, access to health care services, or geographical classification.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:03:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTFB6b094RU9UTTlvS1hFazFoU3lkWnB6OHQ2MHpzR1lfUVg5cld3THROdTFBY2hGNmc2Tl9DOW5zN0xuWk5PN3lFcnJ2ckMtdVl4UEN6b1dMS2lXaWluRV9PMVFDSDR0RG9n</guid></item><item><title>帕金森病正在上升。5个降低患病风险的专家提示- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/09/health/parkinson-risk-reduction-wellness</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            The “Shaking Palsy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4c8qs00073b6ndte7iusz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those are the words Dr. James Parkinson used in &lt;a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/jnp.14.2.223" target="_blank"&gt;an essay&lt;/a&gt; more than 200 years ago to group together symptoms and describe a mysterious infirmity afflicting six individuals in London. The British physician was the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/140/3/843/3053438" target="_blank"&gt;first to identify&lt;/a&gt; and document the condition now known as Parkinson’s disease, a progressive movement disorder. Its hallmark is damage to the dopamine-producing neurons in the brain that can lead to muscle stiffness, slowness, balance issues and a host of other problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4c8qs00083b6n84got7ze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine" target="_blank"&gt;Dopamine is a crucial neurotransmitter &lt;/a&gt;involved in our brain’s reward system. The chemical plays a central role in motivation, as well as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4084861/" target="_blank"&gt;executive function&lt;/a&gt; (which includes attention, decision-making, multitasking and planning), movement and emotional regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4c8qs00093b6nljciy48p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By 2021, public health researchers  reported there were &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/4/e095610" target="_blank"&gt;almost 12 million cases&lt;/a&gt; worldwide. And the number of people living with Parkinson’s is projected to &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/388/bmj-2024-080952" target="_blank"&gt;top 25 million&lt;/a&gt; by 2050. The disease not only &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-020-0117-1" target="_blank"&gt;substantially burdens&lt;/a&gt; the individual, but also their family, their community and society as a whole.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4917y00003b6nhus2wjdf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re now growing as a neurodegenerative disease faster than Alzheimer’s disease — that should grab everybody’s attention,” neurologist Dr. Michael Okun told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast, Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000e3b6ncmjxtj6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parkinson’s disease is so much more than just a shaking palsy, as scientists have come to learn since 1817, but there is still quite a ways to go in identifying its root causes, understanding more fully the progression of the disease, and even developing a foolproof diagnostic test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000f3b6n4ev6avjs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It becomes obvious, just absolutely obvious, when you see the folks with disease that this isn’t just a disease of dopamine; it isn’t just a disease of the brain. We see it in the gut. We see it in the skin. We see it in multiple organs,” said Okun, who cofounded and codirects the Norman Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, and is the medical director and medical adviser for the Parkinson’s Foundation. “So, it is super important that we ask the why: Why does it start? Why does it progress? Why does it spread?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4da7a000g3b6na3b4m2v9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.parkinson.org/advancing-research/our-research/pdgeneration/genetics-behind-pd" target="_blank"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; plays a key role in between 10% and 15% of cases. For many others, Okun said, the underlying cause of the disease might be more mundane and insidious: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11091623/" target="_blank"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt; — via the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3114824/" target="_blank"&gt;the chemicals&lt;/a&gt; with which we regularly come in contact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We have such an opportunity now to understand, hey, we don’t have to live in a world where we think it’s inevitable to get Parkinson’s,” Okun said. His latest book on the disease, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Parkinsons-Plan-Path-Prevention-Treatment/dp/1541705386/" target="_blank"&gt;The Parkinson’s Plan&lt;/a&gt;: A New Path to Prevention and Treatment,” cowritten with Dr. Ray Dorsey, in part explores the associations between the disease and a host of chemicals that &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mds.29371" target="_blank"&gt;quietly assail&lt;/a&gt; our bodies.

            What can you do to reduce your chances of getting Parkinson’s? Okun has a list of 25 tips in his book, and these are his five favorites.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000j3b6nu10wfo7v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Invest in a carbon water filter for your kitchen sink, Okun said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000k3b6nm4gw6nkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A simple carbon filter can reduce the &lt;a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/camp-lejeune/about/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/sites/lejeune/background.html" target="_blank"&gt;invisible toxicants&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186205/" target="_blank"&gt;sneak into drinking water&lt;/a&gt; and may stress vulnerable brain systems,” he said. “Clean water lowers the everyday chemical load your gut and brain must handle.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000l3b6nog29wypb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These filters can reduce exposure to pesticides and chemicals like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7941732/" target="_blank"&gt;trichlorethylene, or TCE&lt;/a&gt;, a common chemical used to dry-clean clothes, decaffeinate coffee and degrease metal, as well as other impurities. (In December 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency announced an almost &lt;a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/news/landmark-victory-parkinsons-community-epa-bans-trichloroethylene" target="_blank"&gt;complete ban of TCE&lt;/a&gt;, but lawsuits have so far &lt;a href="https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/27607-epa-further-delays-provisions-of-trichloroethylene-ban" target="_blank"&gt;stayed the &lt;/a&gt;rule’s effective start date under certain circumstances.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000m3b6nsr2a6ke7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Use air purifiers both at home and work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000n3b6n0arhq5wz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Removing &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8583112/" target="_blank"&gt;fine particulate matter&lt;/a&gt; from indoor air protects the nose-to-brain pathway that may seed Parkinson’s,” Okun said. “Cleaner air means fewer triggers entering through the brain’s front door.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000o3b6n6dg8yoi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Make sure to use an air purifier with a carbon filter designed to remove volatile organic chemicals, or VOCs, such as TCE. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality#:~:text=Volatile%20organic%20compounds%20(VOCs)%20are,cosmetic%2C%20degreasing%20and%20hobby%20products." target="_blank"&gt;Volatile organic compounds are gases&lt;/a&gt; that can be emitted from solid or liquid products, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. These chemicals can cause problems such as eye, nose and throat irritation and damage to the liver, kidney and central nervous system, the federal agency said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000q3b6n5lrdygad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Take the time to wash your fruits and vegetables, even if they are organic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000r3b6nn4d2ajsr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Rinsing and scrubbing your produce … helps remove pesticide residues that can quietly injure mitochondria over time,” Okun noted. “This simple daily habit lowers the exposure load your brain and nervous system must manage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000s3b6nnkhnn86p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And just as you would when washing your hands, you should rinse them for more than 20 seconds, Okun added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader_elevate vossi-subheader_elevate--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmiy4e2eh00133b6nzqluc9bf@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="keep-your-body-moving" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            Exercise every day. Regular movement is thought to prevent or delay the onset of Parkinson’s disease — and it is also crucial for people who already live with the disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000v3b6n87p5vvmv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Exercise every day, using four 20-minute walks (~7000 steps), or an equivalent routine that keeps you moving throughout the day,” Okun said via email. “Movement wakes up natural dopamine circuits, improves mobility, and may possibly slow symptom progression.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000w3b6nlbochgs9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For those who feel unsteady on their feet, Okun noted that a recumbent stationary bike is a safe and effective alternative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000x3b6n8cnrfv9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Prioritize  consistent, high-quality sleep to give your brain a chance to recover every night.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000y3b6nb3r3vmm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Deep sleep activates the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4636982/" target="_blank"&gt;brain’s built-in cleaning system&lt;/a&gt;, flushing toxins and helping symptoms improve the following day,” Okun said. “Protecting sleep is protecting brain health, especially when living with or aiming to prevent Parkinson’s.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmiy4e21q000z3b6n10xbzrop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then, when you get up in the morning, enjoy a cup of caffeinated coffee or tea. Research has consistently associated caffeine consumption with a lower risk of Parkinson’s Disease ; it is believed to protect the dopamine-producing nerve cells from damage caused by environmental toxins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Back in 2023, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/01/ancient-roman-concrete-could-self-heal-thanks-to-hot-mixing-with-quicklime/"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; on MIT scientists’ conclusion that the ancient Romans employed “hot mixing” with quicklime, among other strategies, to make their famous concrete, giving the material self-healing functionality. The only snag was that this didn’t match the recipe as described in historical texts. Now the same team is back with a fresh analysis of samples collected from a recently discovered site that confirms the Romans did indeed use hot mixing, according to a new paper published in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we’ve &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/noblewomans-tomb-reveals-new-secrets-of-ancient-romes-highly-durable-concrete/"&gt;reported previously&lt;/a&gt;, like today’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement" data-uri="7e5fcbf7f79050078486c69c2a8120d1"&gt;Portland cement&lt;/a&gt; (a basic ingredient of modern concrete), ancient &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_concrete" data-uri="57459e017b35b6cdf856f9fbc4b450d3"&gt;Roman concrete&lt;/a&gt; was basically a mix of a semi-liquid mortar and aggregate. Portland cement is typically made by heating limestone and clay (as well as sandstone, ash, chalk, and iron) in a kiln. The resulting clinker is then ground into a fine powder with just a touch of added gypsum to achieve a smooth, flat surface. But the aggregate used to make Roman concrete was made up of fist-sized pieces of stone or bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his treatise &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_architectura" data-uri="eea6afa7452c7f0ebb23ac2d0cb07a89"&gt;&lt;em&gt;De architectura&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (circa 30 CE), the Roman architect and engineer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius" data-uri="3509522d11f467111a16bc495afbaac9"&gt;Vitruvius&lt;/a&gt; wrote about how to build concrete walls for funerary structures that could endure for a long time without falling into ruin. He recommended the walls be at least two feet thick, made of either “squared red stone or of brick or lava laid in courses.” The brick or volcanic rock aggregate should be bound with mortar composed of hydrated lime and porous fragments of glass and crystals from volcanic eruptions (known as volcanic tephra).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admir Masic, an environmental engineer at MIT, has studied ancient Roman concrete for several years. For instance, in 2019, Masic helped pioneer a new set of tools for analyzing Roman concrete samples from Privernum at multiple length scales—notably, Raman spectroscopy for chemical profiling and multi-detector energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for phase mapping the material. Masic was also a co-author of a &lt;a href="https://ceramics.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jace.18133"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; analyzing samples of the ancient concrete used to build a 2,000-year-old mausoleum along the Appian Way in Rome known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Caecilia_Metella" data-uri="a1e0e058f4d17139857bbc00170dfbdb"&gt;Tomb of Caecilia Metella&lt;/a&gt;, a noblewoman who lived in the first century CE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in 2023, Masic’s group analyzed samples taken from the concrete walls of the Privernum, focusing on strange white mineral chunks known as “lime clasts,” which others had largely dismissed as resulting from subpar raw materials or poor mixing. Masic et al. &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add1602"&gt;concluded that&lt;/a&gt; was not the case. Rather, the Romans deliberately employed “hot mixing” with quicklime that gave the material self-healing functionality. When cracks begin to form in the concrete, they are more likely to move through the lime clasts. The clasts can then react with water, producing a solution saturated with calcium. That solution can either recrystallize as calcium carbonate to fill the cracks or react with the pozzolanic components to strengthen the composite material.&lt;/p&gt;
