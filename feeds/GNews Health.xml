            Plant-based meats have an image problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000f3b6nehfgtc8u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not flavor or appearance. Look-alike beef burgers, chicken-like nuggets and faux pork sausages often cook like meat — some even bleed and sizzle in the pan — and are tasty enough to be gobbled up by climate-conscious carnivores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000g3b6ni6k67h45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not their role in saving the planet. According to the &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Good Food Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/resource/environmental-impacts-of-alternative-proteins/" target="_blank"&gt;promoting alternative proteins&lt;/a&gt;, replacing a beef burger with a plant-based patty can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 98%&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and land use by up to 97%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000h3b6nncv2pn2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Yet after an initial surge of consumer interest, the alt-protein market in the United States has recently slowed, according to some &lt;a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2024-state-of-alternative-proteins-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt;. Why the sudden sour taste?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000i3b6n6bc0qwn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Doctors and dietitians are reluctant to consider alternative proteins when advising patients on nutrition because they view these foods as ultraprocessed,” said nutrition scientist Roberta Alessandrini, director of the Dietary Guidelines Initiative at PAN International — &lt;a href="https://pan-int.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Physicians Association for Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; — in Zurich, Switzerland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000j3b6nark07ipt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yet if carefully chosen, these foods can be a valid and helpful way to shift toward more plant-forward diets, which are good for people and the planet,” said Alessandrini, coauthor of a &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; on plant-based meats by PAN International and the Good Food Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Encouraging consumers to swap their beloved animal flesh for plant alternatives is increasingly critical, experts say. Global meat production and demand — a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/08/health/ipcc-report-healthy-eating-climate-diet"&gt;leading contributor&lt;/a&gt; to climate change — is projected to rise by up to 52% by 2050 compared with 2012 levels, &lt;a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/1c58eb36-7684-4032-946d-f014fd777782/content" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000l3b6nlfmwt8qs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s such great urgency related to climate change, environmental degradation and public health that we need to give people as many options as possible, including plant-based meat alternatives,” said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000m3b6n9eoz33g2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show eating a plant-first diet — the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/03/health/2025-best-diet-wellness"&gt;award-winning&lt;/a&gt; Mediterranean diet is an example — can reduce the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/22/health/plant-based-diet-diabetes-study/index.html"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/29/health/mediterranean-diet-statin-study/index.html"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/17/health/mediterranean-style-diet-prevents-dementia/index.html"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/10/21/health/mediterranean-diet-healthier-brain/index.html"&gt;memory loss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/26/health/mediterranean-diet-depression-study-intl/index.html"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/03/07/health/mediterranean-diet-breast-cancer-study-food/index.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000n3b6ntex2w5tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fat composition of beef is so undesirable for health that it’s very easy to be better than that,” Willett said. “Animal products not only have too much saturated fat but lack polyunsaturated fat, fiber and many of the minerals and vitamins available in plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000o3b6nhawvyct1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any other important nutrients beef has that plants lack, such as vitamin B12, can be added to the plant-based meat alternatives, much as we fortify milk with vitamin D and A,” he added. “So I think we really need to look at each one of these novel products on its own merits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000p3b6nup876464@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By their very nature, plant-based meats are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-death-wellness"&gt;ultraprocessed,&lt;/a&gt; an increasingly dirty word to many people, including members of the “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/31/health/maha-toxic-nation-rfk-jr-wellness"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” movement. To mimic the fibrous structure of meat, faux versions may undergo &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1466856424001188#:~:text=Hence%2C%20in%20order%20to%20cater%20to%20the,technology%20is%20applied%20to%20generate%20plant%2Dbased%20meats." target="_blank"&gt;3D printing&lt;/a&gt;, extreme &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/shear-cell-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=Shear%20cell%20technology%20is%20a,build%20up%20the%20biopolymer%20material." target="_blank"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lifeasible.com/freeze-structuring-technique-for-plant-based-meat/#:~:text=(3)%20During%20this%20process%2C%20the%20recipe%20ratio,form%20a%20large%20block%20of%20hard%20fibrin." target="_blank"&gt;cold&lt;/a&gt; manipulations and extrusion processes similar to those applied to ultraprocessed foods.

            Alternative meats also contain natural and artificial &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/9/12/921" target="_blank"&gt;additives&lt;/a&gt; such as binders, emulsifiers, dyes, flavorings, stabilizers and preservatives. The Impossible Burger, for example, uses a genetically modified organism, or GMO, to create &lt;a href="https://faq.impossiblefoods.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019100553-What-is-soy-leghemoglobin-or-heme" target="_blank"&gt;heme&lt;/a&gt;, a molecule that recreates the red color and bleeding typical of beef.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000r3b6nwmpge8h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Proponents of plant-based meat, however, say these alternatives don’t meet the typical characteristics of ultraprocessed foods, nor do they mimic the health harms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000s3b6n0a2ufnx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The conversation needs to significantly change when it comes to ultraprocessed foods because they’re never going to go away — people want easy and convenient food,” said Joy Bauer, a registered dietitian who consults for Beyond Meat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000t3b6nddbqui0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to get to a place where we start to rate ultraprocessed foods because there are some that are super healthy and can help people move in positive directions within their lives,” Bauer said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        The issue of salt and saturated fat

            Plant-based meats also struggle due to their traditionally high levels of salt and saturated fat — both leading players in developing heart disease, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death#:~:text=Leading%20causes%20of%20death%20in,9.1%20million%20deaths%20in%202021." target="_blank"&gt;No. 1 killer&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/09/health/plant-fake-meat-burgers-good-for-you-or-not"&gt;CNN analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Beyond and Impossible burgers had a similar saturated fat profile as beef from cows: Beyond had 6 grams of saturated fat; Impossible had 8 grams of fat (due to coconut oil), and a beef burger had 9 grams of fat. In comparison, a store-bought turkey burger had 4 to 5 grams, while a typical grain-based veggie burger had only 1 gram of saturated fat.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000w3b6nt8rnfx3r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Saturated fat can create plaques that clog arteries, leading to future heart attacks and strokes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes-prevention/media/pdfs/legacy/Participant-Module-12_Keep_Your_Heart_Healthy.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000x3b6n30ee9lsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            High levels of salt are another concern. In the 2019 analysis, Beyond, Impossible and more traditional grain-based burgers each contained 370 to 390 milligrams of sodium. Store-bought turkey burgers, however, contained 95 to 115 milligrams of sodium, while beef patties had only 65 to 75 milligrams.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000y3b6na8blyzlk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That may be a false comparison, however, as many people salt meat during the cooking process, said Christopher Gardner, Rehnborg Farquhar Professor of Medicine at Stanford University in California&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;who directs the Stanford Prevention Research Center’s Nutrition Studies Research Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2000z3b6nd2j0kcik@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32780794/" target="_blank"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; Gardner published in 2020, people ate regeneratively farmed high quality beef for two months before switching to beef, chicken and pork products&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;supplied by Beyond Meat for another two months.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200103b6na3nw6isq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, the red meat products we supplied people had less salt, but we found people seasoned them before they ate them,” Gardner said. “Beef eaters ended up eating the same amount of salt as those who were eating the higher sodium plant-based products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200113b6nl11ts4v1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Blood pressure was identical during the two phases, but “almost everyone was a pound or two or three lighter at the end of the Beyond meat phase than the animal meat phase,” Gardner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200123b6no9c5cg4y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, “bad” cholesterol called LDL, or &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24391-ldl-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;low-density lipoprotein&lt;/a&gt;, and trimethylamine N-oxide, or TMAO, were lower after eating the plant-based meat, Gardner said. Like LDL, TMAO has been linked to an &lt;a href="https://www.clevelandheartlab.com/blog/the-gut-the-heart-and-tmao/" target="_blank"&gt;increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of heart attack, stroke and heart failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Today, the nutrition labels of some plant-based products look much different than when they first landed on store shelves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200143b6nrrqr11fi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In 2021 I published a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/356525283_Nutritional_Quality_of_Plant-Based_Meat_Products_Available_in_the_UK_A_Cross-Sectional_Survey" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; which found plant-based products in the UK were higher in salt than their meat counterparts,” Alessandrini said. “A few years later I repeated the same study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651788/" target="_blank"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; on a much larger sample and found the alternatives had lower salt content than meat products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200153b6nhnt9pxw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Of course, Australia has the Health Star Rating, which puts health labels on the outside of packages,” she added. “Programs like these can encourage manufactures to reformulate their products.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200163b6n8m32g530@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recent studies &lt;a href="https://gfieurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Guide_-Where-does-plant-based-meat-fit-in-the-UPF-conversation_19-May.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; by PAN International and the Good Food Institute found plant-based meats were dramatically lower in saturated fat, a little lower in overall calories, equal in protein, 100% higher in fiber (beef has no fiber) and a bit higher in salt and sugar than conventional meat.  &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200173b6nprsb277f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Impossible Foods, one of the leaders in this space, told CNN the company has lowered the salt and saturated fat content in its products while keeping taste and appearance. The flagship Impossible Burger now has 6 grams instead of 8 grams of saturated fat from coconut oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200183b6n2muxwkng@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coconut oil is “100% fat, 80-90% of which is &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/food-features/coconut-oil/" target="_blank"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;,” according to Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Like lard, it has a firm texture at room temperature.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i200193b6nicb8jyxq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Coconut oil is a source of saturated fat, but nearly all of our plant-based meat products have at least 25% less saturated fat compared to the animal equivalent,” Impossible Foods chief science officer Sunil Chandran said in an email.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001a3b6nvu2gz7ow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This includes both our flagship Impossible Beef which has 33% less saturated fat than 80/20 beef, and our leaner, heart-healthy Impossible Lite Beef which has a whopping 75% less saturated fat than 90/10 lean beef,” Chandran said. “Plus, coconut oil is essential to providing that marbling effect and juiciness that makes meat so craveable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001b3b6n3pop0hc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond Meat, another leader in the alt-meat industry, has reformulated its products four times to meet consumer demand for healthier products, said Beyond Meat spokeswoman Shira Zackai.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001c3b6nzz4cpqc5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the first changes was to replace coconut oil with avocado oil, which reduced “levels of saturated fat in most product to 2 grams and at times 1 gram,” all while keeping at least 20 grams of protein, Zackai said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001d3b6nn4cqk47j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I suggested they cut back on fortification, and now their ingredient list is streamlined — it’s simplified,” said Bauer, the registered dietitian. “And they did this to all of their products, not just beef.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001e3b6nda075mub@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sodium is now down 20%. Plant protein was diversified to a mix of red lentils, yellow peas, fava beans and brown rice to be a complete protein with all the essential amino acids.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While manufacturers continue to tweak their products to overcome the stigma of ultraprocessed foods, nutritionists suggest consumers move forward in choosing products that help the planet — as long as they keep reading the nutrition label.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001g3b6nfg4b8v6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would look for something with a good fat composition in which saturated fat is less than a third of the total fat,” Willett said. “Some vegetable burgers made from peas and legumes can be quite starchy, which the body breaks down similarly to sugar, so I would prefer to see alternatives with more healthy fat, more nuts, more soy.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001h3b6n9davzfum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the Dietary Guidelines for Americans call for a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-education-resources-materials/sodium-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt;2,300 milligrams of sodium&lt;/a&gt; per day for adults, “the American Heart Association recommends a limit of &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;1,500 milligrams for adults&lt;/a&gt; over 50, which is the standard I prefer,” Willett said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001i3b6nm2l3rb2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Look for about 1 milligram of sodium per calorie, which is a pretty good criteria,” he added. “In general, salt and saturated fat are the two really important factors — along with something that’s flavorful or delicious, which is, of course, up to the consumer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001j3b6ndgcneh8t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One more key point from Willett: Before plant-based meats can truly help save the planet, they need to come down in price.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmd9di8i2001k3b6ngdj0dgvm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These products are quite a bit more expensive, from what I’ve seen, than basic hamburger,” he said, “and we really need products that are price competitive with the beef and pork if we’re going to see them used on a daily basis, not just by people who can afford it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

However, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24280-triclosan" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, triclosan can still be found in some toothpastes, deodorants, cosmetics and detergents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QNB4GKQUNVFZLMEMDLV4PXM4M4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The recent study followed 347 mothers and their children from pregnancy through the children’s 12th birthdays. During that period, urinary triclosan concentrations in mother-child pairs were assessed through age 5, and then again at 8 and 12 years old.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;In South Korea, there's a long hallway lined with walk-in refrigerators. Inside are boxes filled with oral cholera vaccines. This is the emergency cholera vaccine stockpile — and boxes are flying off the shelves to places like Angola, Sudan and South Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"At the moment, we're shipping about 5 million doses every month, so this means that as soon as the box comes in, another one is going out," says Allyson Russell, an epidemiologist at Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and a senior program manager for outbreaks and global health security. Gavi, a global public-private organization, funds the stockpile and aims to have a little more than 5 million doses available at any given time, although it has had &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/07/1236721063/the-world-is-facing-a-major-cholera-vaccine-shortage-amid-outbreaks" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trouble in the past&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meeting this target.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are similar stockpiles around the world. In freezers in Switzerland, there are Ebola vaccines. Elsewhere there are meningitis vaccines stored up; same with yellow fever vaccines. While some are kept at ultra-cold temperatures, like the Ebola vaccines, most only need to be refrigerated. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Imagine sticking your hand in a refrigerator to get out your groceries," says Russell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first global stockpile was established in 1997 when major meningitis outbreaks in Africa prompted public health crisis. The vaccines are available to &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/everything-you-need-know-about-global-emergency-vaccine-stockpiles" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;any country&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the world. These stockpiles are now in the spotlight because, for the first time, researchers have quantified just how many lives have been saved by drawing on the stored vaccines. But this news comes against the backdrop of uncertainty. There are new concerns about what the future of these global stockpiles will look like amid a major drop in global health funding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exactly how much of a 'game changer'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Russell spends her days immersed in the details of the stockpile system. She knows which countries have emailed in the form to request doses from the stockpile. She knows whether the doses are being raced to an outbreak via chartered flight or in the cargo of a commercial airplane.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And one thing is clear to her. "You can see how vaccines change the trajectory of what happens [in an outbreak]," she says. "Vaccine can really be a game changer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But, she says, she's never known exactly how much of a "game changer" these stockpiles are — until now.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have crunched the numbers. They looked at more than 200 outbreaks over the past 20-some years, modeling what would happen without the vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.burnet.edu.au/about-us/our-people-and-structure/our-people/nick-scott/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nick Scott&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a co-author of &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the&lt;em&gt; British Medical Journal — Global Health&lt;/em&gt;, says the results were exciting: A 60% reduction in cases and deaths from outbreaks because of the stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's quite an amazing thing," said Scott, who is head of modeling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, an independent medical research group. That 60% drop means about 6 million cases were averted and 300,000 deaths were averted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This study really was meant to ask the question of, are GAVI stockpiles worthwhile? Is it worthwhile to have them?" says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/360/ruth-karron" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Ruth Karron&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who is director of the Johns Hopkins Vaccine Initiative and was not involved in the study. "And I think that the answer — very robustly — is absolutely."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The research — which was funded by Gavi and started in early 2024 with the goal of helping inform its strategic planning — found over $32 billion dollars in economic benefits from the stockpiles, given there were fewer deaths and less disability in the 200-some outbreaks researchers considered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The researchers say this is a significant underestimate and the true economic benefits are likely much higher. That's because this calculation does not take into account things like the cost of outbreak response that are avoided or the economic disruptions created by large outbreaks. Based on Gavi's &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/sites/default/files/investing/funding/resource-mobilisation/Gavi-Investment-Opportunity-2026-2030.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;financial planning documents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, procurement for the stockpiles costs less than $100 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scott's team also found that speed really matters. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"When there is an outbreak, the faster the vaccine response can start, the more impactful it will be," he says. This matters because containing a disease's spread can mean avoiding huge social disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we found is that these vaccines are really critical for preventing things like school closures, business closures, travel restrictions," Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The importance of speed is one of the reasons the stockpiles exist in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It can easily take up to a year to make these vaccines. Ebola vaccines take a year. Meningitis vaccines take about four to six months," Russell says. "If you were to place the order and then make the vaccines, who knows what would happen to the outbreak."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, Scott says, having the vaccines ready is not enough. There also need to be mechanisms in place to get the doses to the outbreak and then administer them to people who live and work in the affected area. As international aid organizations face historic funding cuts these steps could get harder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Everything is up for question'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Karron says the findings come at a particularly important time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01240-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published this month in the medical journal The Lancet. And it's forcing international health organizations to grapple with what they can afford to keep and what they have to let go. These days everything is on the table, including the global stockpiles of emergency vaccines, says Karron.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Gavi is almost $3 billion short of its budget goal for the next five years. Part of the shortfall comes from the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/06/25/g-s1-74554/rfk-jr-vaccine-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. announcing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month that it will cut off support for Gavi until it is able to "re-earn the public trust." Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explained the decision by saying Gavi had neglected issues of vaccine safety, an accusation Gavi vigorously denies. Critics says &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/g-s1-74752/rfk-jr-vaccines-safety-gavi" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; RFK Jr. cited as evidence is flawed. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;This week, the organization's board is meeting to figure out what to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So obviously, everything is up for question," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One challenge with the stockpiles is that stored doses can expire, explains Karron. Doses made for routine immunizations are, generally, used quickly and don't bump up against their expiration dates. That's not a guarantee with the stockpile. Gavi does have a system where once vaccines in the stockpile reach one year left in their shelf life, they can be used in a preventive program — for example in a high-risk location where researchers anticipate meningitis outbreaks. However, Karron says, that is not always possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So, the question is: Is it worth the investment knowing that you might have some vaccine that goes to waste?" she asks. She says the clear answer from this study is that it's in everyone's interest to keep the emergency vaccine stockpiles fully stocked.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we don't want some of these diseases, like Ebola, to come to our [U.S.] shores, we really need to contain them at the source," Karron says.&lt;/p&gt;

This girl behaved really badly and completely shattered my friend’s heart, and while I don’t want to believe he would put something like this online, he is so hurt that it’s not outside the realm of possibility. She would lose her job and her career if this video was found, and she comes from a very conservative family. My questions: What are my obligations here? Do I ask my friend about it? Contact the ex?

After a bad breakup, they took the pictures out of the gym sock and burned them. It’s too bad that one can no longer memorialize one’s hotness with such nonchalance. As my colleague Emily Bazelon&lt;a href="https://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/revenge_porn_legislation_a_new_bill_in_california_doesn_t_go_far_enough.html"&gt; recently described&lt;/a&gt;, this new plague of revenge porn is ruining lives and there is currently little legal recourse. (California just passed a law making&lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/10/01/california-brown-anti-revenge-porn-bill/2906305/"&gt; posting such material a misdemeanor&lt;/a&gt;.) I talked to expert&lt;a href="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/faculty/profiles/faculty.html?facultynum=028"&gt; Danielle Citron&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law and author of the forthcoming book, Hate 3.0, about what can be done for this woman. First of all, contact your friend. If indeed he is the perpetrator, you should tell him that you have now seen the video. Tell him you know his ex did him wrong, but he should not compound the wrongdoing by exacting such vicious revenge. Citron says if he posted to a site where he controls his content, he could simply take down the video. Let’s hope it hasn’t been more widely disseminated and that her name hasn’t gotten attached. But if he gave it to a revenge porn website, then unfortunately he’s really lost control of it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="171" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sa001r3b6hjwawcllb@published"&gt;You should also contact the ex-girlfriend. She’s entitled to know the bad news, which has the potential for painful professional and personal consequences. Citron says that if the video was a selfie, the woman would own the copyright. In that case it would be worth it for her to hire a lawyer to write a letter to the site operator where it’s being posted without her permission. But its being taken down is far from assured. If the woman is sure that the images were posted by her ex, Citron laid out other legal avenues she could explore, such as filing a civil claim of infliction of emotional distress or seeking criminal harassment action be taken against him. But Citron notes pursuing a civil lawsuit would be expensive and that law enforcement has taken a lax attitude toward these cases. Sadly, because of technology, people need to be aware when giving sexual photographs or videos of themselves to a paramour that love may die, but the images could live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;

As I married a year ago, we field endless questions about when we’re going to have kids. My brother just had a baby. His sibling just had a baby. Going on Facebook is an endless parade of their kids from all of our relatives. Discussions are focused solely around their kids, then are turned to us. I keep saying, “We’re happily child-free,” but I’m losing my resolve. I’m constantly surrounded by something I’ll never get to have, but I don’t know how to broach the conversation with our families. I’m afraid the fertility-happy will try and tell us we just haven’t been trying long enough or that God will give us a baby when he sees fit. Based on our finances and the frequency of things falling through, adoption is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, I’ve “opted out” (so has my husband, in solidarity) as we’ve been continually trying to get pregnant in the years since. Last time I flew, the TSA agent roughly groped my vagina and labia, and I had a panic attack. I’ve avoided flying since.&lt;/p&gt;

The timing of your last miscarriage is terrible, and your reluctance at the thought of getting X-rayed again is understandable, but the energy of the X-ray beam of an airport scanner is very low and does not penetrate the skin. According to the &lt;a href="http://hps.org/"&gt;Health Physics Society&lt;/a&gt;, an organization dedicated to radiation safety,&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sr00213b6hqo00f0tn@published"&gt;There is an American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) consensus standard stating that people-scanning devices should expose an individual to no more than 0.25 microsievert per screening (one screening procedure generally consists of two scans). The two primary companies that sell people screeners say that their devices expose people to half that amount of radiation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7w32sb001s3b6hwy0bfir2@published"&gt;For perspective, 0.25 microsievert is also received by flying about a minute and a half (cosmic radiation during commercial flight exposes fliers to about 10 microsievert per hour). It is also received by living for 40 minutes (natural background radiation exposes people to about 0.35 microsievert per hour)…The American National Standards Institute/Health Physics Society (ANSI/HPS) consensus standard took into account the varying sensitivity of different groups of people who might be scanned. The authors first looked at a number of reports and published studies on the health effects of radiation. They then chose the 0.25 microsievert dose level to ensure that children and pregnant individuals can be safely scanned with these devices. The x-ray scanner uses a very low-energy and low-intensity radiation, so that an embryo/fetus is not exposed to any radiation that could possibly increase the developmental risks of radiation to the embryo.&lt;/p&gt;

Learn more about anxiety treatments—anything from deep-breathing exercises to &lt;em&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/em&gt; —that you can perform on yourself when you’re feeling cornered in the security line. You can also apply for TSA Pre-Check, which may only require you to go through an old-school metal detector. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

And for the third time, my mom pressured me to name her after my late sister, “Paloma.” Like before, I told her no, and we went with our originally planned name. But now my mom is on a push about how I haven’t honored Paloma or shared memories with my kids about her, and that they’re being harmed by missing out on her as an aunt. My 6-year-old and 4-year-old know that I had a sister, but that she’s dead (classic blunt child response). But I haven’t really talked much about her. Now that my parents live closer and see the kids more often, my mom wants to change that. I don’t really want to.&lt;/p&gt;

She died of complications from anorexia in her early 20s. Because of the age difference and her substantial impatient time, we weren’t that close. I honestly felt more relief than anything when she died, because her eating disorder tortured my parents almost as much as it tortured her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vt00183b6heg97eqrk@published"&gt;I know EDs and mental illness in general can be hell, but I genuinely have no good memories of her after she was about 15. She was deeply in the grip of the disorder, and it made her mean, self-destructive, judgmental, and secretive. I have distinct memories of her telling me from her hospital bed that I was fat and unlovable when I was going through puberty. And that’s probably the warmest interaction we had in my teens.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4vz00193b6hls9xpux2@published"&gt;I recognize the memories I have aren’t the full version of who she was before she got sick. I loved her, but I didn’t like her. I don’t know what I could possibly pass on to my kids to share about her, besides one or two memories from when I was 7 or 8 years old. I recognize that my mom is grieving, and probably always will be. But I don’t really want to get into the details of Paloma until my kids are teenagers. Is that unfair?&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, there may need to be some guardrails around these conversations. But I suspect your mom fears that Paloma is being erased or forgotten by the family.  That’s a devastating prospect for any parent. Telling her, “I can’t be the one to share Paloma with the kids, but you’re welcome to,” might give you the reprieve you need.&lt;/p&gt;

The Paloma you knew is, for all intents and purposes, not the same Paloma your mom knew and loved. She might need a neutral third party to help her come to terms with that painful truth. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

We have an 8-year-old daughter and a 5-year-old son. The issue we’re facing is that my in-laws have a pool with no fence around it. Because of this, I have refused to let the kids visit their place without my husband and/or me present. My mother-in-law claims that because our kids know how to swim, a fence isn’t necessary—and that installing one would “spoil” her view of the yard. She’s been rather abrasive with me because I refuse to compromise. What can I do to impress upon her that tragedies can still happen, even to kids who know how to swim?&lt;/p&gt;

If the science might sway her, you can point her to &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001047/full"&gt;studies that show that pool fencing&lt;/a&gt; significantly reduces the risk of drowning. Or that organizations like the &lt;a href="https://ndpa.org/shop-the-best-pool-safety-products-for-summer/"&gt;National Drowning Prevention Alliance strongly recommend them&lt;/a&gt; (plus they have suggestions on which to buy).&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wi001e3b6h5q6h13ix@published"&gt;I confess that I am &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a pool owner, but I wonder if some compromise can be found. Would she be more amenable if she knew about the existence of removable fences—one that she can put up and take down at her leisure? Maybe not, since it’ll require additional work on her part. But she could presumably take the fence down if she plans to have company over, for example, or is having a weekend at home without the kids around. There are also &lt;a href="https://usglassfence.com/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-glass-pool-fencing/"&gt;glass pool fences&lt;/a&gt; that could help keep her “view” intact while still providing safety.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4x4001u3b6hjqh0241b@published"&gt;I wonder whether a broader conversation about all points of pool safety might uncover more common ground with your MIL than you expected. Take the opportunity to talk through other pool precautions the family should be taking beyond fencing. The experts quoted in that earlier Slate article, for example, point out that the most crucial piece of pool safety is close supervision when someone is in the water. They stressed that the person supervising “needs to be constantly attentive, close by (within arm’s reach for a novice swimmer, she says), capable of identifying drowning, and prepared to intervene.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="51" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4xa001v3b6hokjvgdvn@published"&gt;For the future, it might be worth considering where you’ll stand on the issue when your kids are a bit older. How long would the fence need to stay up for you to be comfortable? Is there an age where you don’t feel like a fence is needed? Perhaps the answer is no, and that’s OK, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd97w4wq001l3b6h0cw2xfnw@published"&gt;Realistically, she probably won’t budge, and neither should you. You say you recently just moved, so give it some time. Be kind in your insistence, and as patient as you can be when she expresses her refusal to change her yard, as is her right. Hopefully, she will (begrudgingly) get used to your rules. Demand safety, but don’t let the fence come between you if it doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006q3b6h0q1rrxzc@published"&gt;My husband and I are expecting our first child in October. The thing is, my parents are divorced and cannot stand each other—yet both want to be at the hospital, outside the delivery room, so they can see the baby immediately. I’m worried they will cause a scene (as they have at multiple family events) during what will already be a very stressful and emotionally fraught time. My husband says he doesn’t trust them to keep it together and wants to make them wait and see the baby separately in the hospital room. This will be their first grandchild. Should I give them a chance, or is my husband right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006t3b6htduj96mp@published"&gt;Let me clarify a few things. You say your parents want to be outside the delivery room so they can see the baby immediately. Have you done a hospital tour yet? I delivered in two different facilities, and in both cases, anyone not directly assisting with the birth was kept down the hall, through a secure door, in a designated waiting area—essentially “on hold” until the baby and afterbirth were delivered and mom was cleaned up. So before you make this decision, be sure you know your hospital’s procedures and set your parents’ expectations accordingly. (While you’re at it, you might also inquire whether the hospital has separate waiting rooms, where both parents could wait but stay apart.)&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwo006u3b6hpr0ticrv@published"&gt;It’s also important to keep in mind that you have no idea how your birth is going to go. Most of the women I know experienced both intense joy and intense vulnerability in those post-first-birth hours. Some wanted to see people right away—eager to enjoy their baby with their loved ones. Others felt overwhelmed or in so much discomfort that they only wanted their spouse and child nearby. And for some, what they wanted after the baby was born was the opposite of what they’d planned beforehand. So be upfront with yourself and your loved ones that any plan you make is subject to change at any point.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="111" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006v3b6hdslpi4yd@published"&gt;Which brings me to one of my two most important points in this reply: Your letter told me what your parents want, and what your husband wants. What do you want? Because, as the owner of the VIU (Very Important Uterus), the way this day goes is ultimately your call. It’s arguably the only time in your life when you can make demands that others must simply fulfill.  If you want your parents to meet the baby together, then brush up on your mediation skills and set some non-negotiable ground rules. If you’d rather tell everyone to take a chill pill and wait, that’s your prerogative, too. You get to decide what this looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006w3b6h8msvuppw@published"&gt;Since this is an advice column, though, I’ll give you my personal opinion. If it were me, I’d let the grandparents meet the baby first—before any other siblings or family who might also be in the waiting room—but only once I felt settled and ready. And I would have them meet the baby separately rather than together. This is a huge milestone, not only for you and your husband, but also for your parents (especially if this is their first grandchild). I wouldn’t want anyone to ruin that for you or themselves, and I would be nervous that putting them in a room together is setting them up to fail. I don’t want that for any of you. And I’d flip a coin (in advance and in full view) to decide who goes first.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd985uwp006x3b6herj9fget@published"&gt;I will close with the second of my two most important points: This birth is just the beginning. Once the baby is born, your parents are going to want to be present for many more events, from birthday parties and religious rites to band concerts. If I were in your shoes, I’d start demanding that they grow up and learn how to be in the same room with each other. Your child deserves no less, and your life will be much easier if you don’t have to keep asking versions of this same question over the next 18-plus years. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s the only way I knew how to put it. So many things could set her off: new carpeting, air fresheners, plastic off-gassing, diesel. Perfumes were among the worst offenders. On top of that, she developed terrible food allergies. The sound of her sniffling became the chorus of my childhood. Some days she couldn’t get out of bed. I’d peek into her darkened room and see her face pinched in discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Her joints ached, her head swam. Doctors suggested that maybe she was depressed or anxious. “Well, you’d be anxious too if you couldn’t lick an envelope, couldn’t pick up your daughter in a car,” she’d reply. She tried allergists, got nowhere. Finally, she found her way to holistic health, whose practitioners told her she had something called multiple chemical sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As long as people have complained that man-made stuff in their environment causes health problems—migraines and asthma, exhaustion and mood swings—the medical establishment has largely dismissed them. The American Medical Association, World Health Organization, and the American Academy of Asthma, Allergy &amp;amp; Immunology don’t recognize chemical sensitivity as a diagnosis. If they talk about it at all, they tend to dismiss it as psychosomatic, a malady of the neurotic and health-obsessed. Why, these authorities wondered, would people react to minute traces of a huge array of chemicals? And why couldn’t they ever seem to get better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;This isn’t some trivial affliction. Roughly a quarter of American adults report some form of chemical sensitivity; it lives alongside chronic pain and fibromyalgia as both evidently real and resistant to mainstream diagnosis or treatment. My mom tried a thousand things—elimination diets, antihistamines, lymphatic massage, antidepressants, acupuncture, red light therapy, saunas, heavy-metal detoxes. Sometimes her symptoms eased, but she never got better. Her illness ruled our lives, dictating what products we bought, what food we ate, where we traveled. I felt there had to be an answer for why this was happening. It didn’t take me long to learn that, if there was one, it’d come from a figure as unassuming as she is provocative: the scientist Claudia Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;On a warm&lt;/span&gt; Texas afternoon, Miller and her affable husband, Bob, lead me through the San Antonio Botanical Garden. A monarch flits by. “I’ve noticed so many fewer butterflies, so many fewer birds, even the last couple of years,” Miller observes. Her raspy voice comes out so quietly that, at times, my recording device fails to pick it up. People are perpetually leaning in close or asking her to repeat herself. At 78, Miller typically uses a cane, but Bob gets the walker out of the car so she can cover more distance. She wears her silver hair in a low side ponytail, fixed in place with a scrunchie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;With her wide, thin-rimmed glasses, Miller disappears into the scenery, but she’s a particularly visible presence in her field. Now a professor emeritus at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Miller has held several federal appointments, chaired National Institutes of Health meetings, testified before Congress, consulted for the Environmental Protection Agency, authored dozens of papers, and worked with the Canadian, German, Japanese, and Swedish governments. In all this, she has tried to make sense of and raise awareness for chemical intolerance. One patient advocate I interviewed called her “Saint Claudia” for her commitment to overlooked and misunderstood patients. Kristina Baehr, an attorney who defends victims of toxic exposures, told me, “To have experts like Dr. Miller tell them you’re not crazy, this is very real, is very life-giving to people. She’s able to validate their experience with facts, with science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;One such fact, Miller explains, is this: Over the past century, the United States has undergone a chemical revolution. “Fossil fuels, coal, oil, natural gas, their combustion products, and then their synthetic chemical derivatives are mostly new since World War II,” she says. “Plasticizers, forever chemicals, you name it: These are all foreign chemicals.” They’re everywhere you look, in homes and offices, parks and schools. They’re also, Miller believes, making people very sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 1997, Miller proposed a career-defining theory of how people succumb to this condition. It came with a technical-sounding name, toxicant-induced loss of tolerance, and a convenient acronym, TILT. You can lose tolerance after one severe exposure, Miller says, or after a series of smaller exposures over time. In either case, a switch is flipped: Suddenly, people are triggered by even tiny amounts of everyday substances—cigarette smoke, antibiotics, gas from their stoves—that never bothered them before. These people become, in a word, TILT-ed. It’s not unlike developing an allergy, when the body labels a substance as dangerous and then reacts accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQTE1VOFoxS3dibkJZUEZIQ1c1ODRuSXEzb1pGbEhOZE1PVUtHQUZxMHhTR1JiYjFMTUYxY1RYejVRMTh4UldMVnhLbUlCVnVaUlY3QmlKcDlFVFp2YjJmRmRycjNqcnFRWk1haVhPOVNBd3JfeV9qaTA4VnFTeHhwVVh1UGM</guid></item><item><title>我在最致命的心脏病发作中幸存下来-这是我在濒死体验中看到的-每日邮报 | I survived deadliest sort of heart attack - this is what I saw during my near-death experience - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNUldRRHI3OHlUSTVmVDY0SzFtUFJkaHU1OHpfWWczVFFBZGwzLVJJU2p2em5Ia01zR080SUhSY3UxTFRQVG0wMTJUQ3FZdFpiUWpzTGhmWTVZMDBrdENwcDdEa0MtSFNPeFgyeWhXTk8wVl9jaDdpRXZ0b2RfWVVseHdBaUtNcmVfdTFGSTNqNHQxQ09yNE9KVGlPTThIMUwxdkxReVAzdGfSAa4BQVVfeXFMT2paTHZYSTdFUnRBckxZdmRIY3Zaa1d0Q1duUXNjNDN1S3otbHM0djFLc3VBdmRIRXlEcUFNZHF6blBvT3RDbEJoUk10RlJMZjJiQ2t5Z1F5R3N2U1c2OU1zYkt3WVZ3T21qRHZneXVMQVlaYV9Yb1JUaWk2YWFRRUpFVEpJZU9ZNURQMXZlaEl3dTBZTkwwZ3JMQkd0cGZRRU9fZ0ZCczNXeG5TMDJn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A mother-of-three who had a near-death experience after suffering one of the deadliest types of heart attack has revealed in vivid detail what she felt and saw 'on the other side'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jenna Tanner, 49, who is now writing a book about the astonishing ordeal, said it has made her realise what really matters in life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tanner, &lt;span&gt;from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/oklahoma/index.html" id="mol-6e4df230-660f-11f0-a022-a11f8b20571d"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, admits she mistook the first signs—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;chest pain and breathlessness— as the flu, something her children had recently recovered from.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But just a few days later, on 9 March 2022, the stay-at-home mother suffered a 'widowmaker' heart attack, causing her to lose consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These attacks occur when there is a full blockage in the heart's biggest artery—and just 12 per cent of victims survive one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tanner said: 'It felt like an elephant had walked in on my chest and I knew instantly what was happening.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling her 'out of body' experience, Ms Tanner said: 'It was like floating through space. I was getting closer to what I would describe as a nebula. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There was a big cloud of colors moving that were changing. Everything was vivid stars. I was just floating peacefully.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna initially dismissed her symptoms as the flu which her children had recently recovered from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna suffered a major heart attack—also known as a 'widow-maker' heart attack given its scarily low survival rate &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Not once did I remember or relive any bad parts of life. Everything that I thought about was the connections I had made with people or places while I was alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was just all the good stuff.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luckily, family members had called emergency services—medics arrived just 13 minutes later and were able to resuscitate her, saving her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Referring to Ms Tanner as a 'miracle' case, her cardiologist said: 'In a 20-year career and over 4,000 surgeries, I've never seen anything like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I didn't even know people could survive this.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Ms Tanner arrived in hospital, cardiologists implanted a heart pump and a stent to widen the narrowed artery—a procedure which usually requires heart bypass surgery—and restore blood flow to the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And after just ten days in hospital—six of which she spent in intensive care—the mother-of-three walked out on her own, unaided by doctors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet her recovery has been far from easy, seeing her gain almost three stone—which she has since lost—and suffer post-traumatic stress disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jenna's X-ray shows a blockage in the LMCA, which supplies most of the heart muscle with life-giving blood and oxygen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The fire department reached Jenna's home within 13 minutes, providing a life-saving service which saw Jenna walk out of hospital just 10 days after suffering a serious heart attack &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;NHS data shows a rise in the number of younger adults suffering from heart attacks over the past decade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She now has to take thirteen different types of medication to manage her symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fire department, which came to Ms Tanner's rescue as it was closest to where she lived, has since received an award for reaching her in record time and providing life-saving care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A widowmaker heart attack occurs when a blood clot completely obstructs the left main coronary artery (LMCA), the most critical artery of the heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within minutes, this can cut-off life-giving oxygen to the heart and the muscle can die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even if a person receives immediate treatment, this sort of heart attack can cause irreversible tissue damage that can permanently affect the functioning of the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are now urging health authorities to update current guidelines so more people can be tested for early warning signs—potentially saving thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tanner’s case comes amid a worrying rise in premature deaths from heart attacks and strokes, which last year reached their highest level in over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;MailOnline has previously reported that the number of under-40s treated by the NHS for heart attacks is also climbing, with soaring obesity rates and related health issues believed to be key drivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK, around 420 people of working age die of as a result of heart disease each week, totalling an alarming 21,975 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cardiovascular disease is America's number one killer and nearly 1million people die of it every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Genetic variation can also predict how well a person will respond to different weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e16a07" class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03827-z" target="_blank"&gt;study published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Medicine, more than 600 researchers from around the world worked together to compile genetic data from more than 5 million people — the largest and most diverse genetic dataset to date. They also used genetic data from 23andMe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-53e505" class="body-graf"&gt;From the dataset, the researchers were able to create what’s known as a polygenic risk score, which takes into account which genetic variants a person has that have been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-wont-solely-defined-bmi-new-plan-global-experts-rcna187724" target="_blank"&gt;higher BMI in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0f1f6b" class="body-graf"&gt;The score, the researchers said, could be used to predict a person’s risk of obesity as an adult — before they even turn 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1afce6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Childhood is the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/new-guidelines-treating-childhood-obesity-include-medications-surgery-rcna64651" target="_blank"&gt;best time to intervene&lt;/a&gt;,” said study co-author Ruth Loos, a professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research. (Research conducted at the center is not influenced by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, though some of the study authors had ties to pharmaceutical companies that make weight loss drugs.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa156c" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings come as obesity is rising around the world. Rates of obesity in adults have more than doubled globally since 1990, and adolescent rates have quadrupled, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight" target="_blank"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. About 16% of adults worldwide have obesity and the situation is worse in the United States, where more than 40% of adults have obesity, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db508.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics&lt;/a&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c37dc3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twice as effective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6ae5e4" class="body-graf"&gt;The new test is not the first that predicts a person’s risk of obesity, but Loos and her team showed it was about twice as effective as the method doctors currently use to assess their patients. That &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)30290-9?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867419302909%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank"&gt;polygenetic score&lt;/a&gt; can account for about 8.5% of a person’s risk for having a high BMI as an adult. The new score increased that to about 17.6%, at least in people with European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3a4ecd" class="body-graf"&gt;“That’s a pretty powerful risk indicator for obesity, but it still leaves open a lot that is unknown,” said Dr. Roy Kim, a pediatric endocrinologist at Cleveland Clinic Children’s who was not involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3dec93" class="body-graf"&gt;Based on this score, more than 80% of a person’s &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scans-show-different-factors-can-influence-obesity-men-women-rcna78340" target="_blank"&gt;risk for obesity can be explained by other factors&lt;/a&gt;, such as where they live, what kinds of foods they have access to, and how much they exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2f2207" class="body-graf"&gt;The test was not nearly as effective in predicting obesity risk in non-Europeans. It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2fSAVZBVV95cUxNVXdnVUQ4OXhzNlJiUmJGbjBJYjNsbEhKcWdPZ2pYNHhyUnkzY3FhZmlfNTdfd05UakMtazNGcmxVd1lzZW4xTV84SG5ZRGdSLXhnYUNFUQ</guid></item><item><title>基因检测可以预测肥胖的几率，从而进行早期干预- NBC新闻 | A genetic test could predict the odds of obesity, allowing for early interventions - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c517a0" class="body-graf"&gt;A genetic test may one day predict a child’s risk of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/obesity-dipped-us-adults-rcna183952" target="_blank"&gt;obesity in adulthood&lt;/a&gt;, paving the way for early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cd846c" class="body-graf"&gt;Certain genetic variants can affect how a person’s body stores fat or make them more prone to overeating.

It explained about 16% of the risk for having a high BMI in East Asian Americans, but just 2.2% in rural Ugandans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a9f9f1" class="body-graf"&gt;About 70% of people whose data was included in the study were of predominantly European ancestry. About 14% were Hispanic and typically had a mix of ancestries. About 8% were of predominantly East Asian descent and just under 5% were of predominantly African ancestry. These samples were predominantly from African American people, who largely had mixed ancestry. Just 1.5% were of predominantly South Asian ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d0b2f" class="body-graf"&gt;Loos said the new score is a big step forward, but that it’s still a prototype. The next step is to collect more — and more diverse — data on people with African ancestry in particular to improve how well the score works for everyone, not just white people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b48af5" class="body-graf"&gt;She said the score could offer one indicator — what &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/heart-health/new-blood-pressure-drug-helps-people-uncontrolled-hypertension-trial-rcna198443" target="_blank"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is to heart disease, for example — that could help predict a person’s risk of developing obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-81ae7b" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not only about genetics, so genetics alone can never accurately predict obesity,” Loos said. “For the general obesity that we see all over the world, we need other factors such as lifestyle that need to be part of the predictions.” Genetics play a bigger role in severe obesity, meaning a BMI of more than 40, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6998b9" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, identifying a person’s genetic risk early on in childhood and intervening early with lifestyle coaching could make a big difference, she said. Research has shown that about 55% of children with obesity go on to have obesity in adolescence, and that about 80% of those individuals will have obesity in adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5b14e1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Behavioral things are really important,” Kim said. “Their environment, their access to healthy food, exercise opportunities, even their knowledge about healthy foods all affect a person’s obesity risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-43f7a3" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are genetics, really?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-da5b10" class="body-graf"&gt;Although studies in identical twins have found that genetics can account for as much as 80% of the reason a person has obesity, lifestyle factors still play a huge role, Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-411973" class="body-graf"&gt;“Even with the same genetic makeup, people can have different body types,” he said. “From a very young age in my practice, we educate patients about the importance of eating protein-rich foods, a lot of fruits and vegetables and not too many refined carbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3635fb" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Juliana Simonetti, co-director of the Comprehensive Weight Management Program at the University of Utah, has been using genetic testing in her adult patients for about five years. She said understanding a person’s genes can help doctors better treat weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f62664" class="body-graf"&gt;“Obesity is not homogeneous. We have different kinds and different presentations,” said Simonetti, who wasn’t involved with the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5012c" class="body-graf"&gt;Simonetti uses a person’s genes to determine if a patient struggles with satiety, or feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bce1e7" class="body-graf"&gt;“They eat but do not feel full,” Simonetti said, adding that this is a disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting certain pathways in the body. People who have these mutations “tend to have higher weight,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7fc797" class="body-graf"&gt;But such mutations do not tell the whole genetic story of obesity, Simonetti said. The genes that a person inherits from either parent, even if they are not mutations, also determine how a person’s body stores weight or uses energy. Both can play a big role in obesity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3d9cb3" class="body-graf"&gt;Genetic testing is also starting to be able to determine how well certain weight loss drugs will work for a person, Simonetti said, but she added this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b002c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We are talking about three out of 80 mutations that we can treat,” she said. “We are getting better, and the more data we have, I’m hopeful that we are going to do a better job in being more precise in understanding treatment responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 09:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNaDh0RTcya1NFOUg5eW93bGZ6bEtXRTZsNVFnLVhvVElsY3E1ZkY3b050RzJ4bDdTR1ZidDc5M2ljY0h6ZnhVbDJ4WDJpYUJMV1VyOHI2NDN5d1dHSUxJQ0trcFQ4RlU4bmJyVmJnWTFmUXAxXzJxLVZXMUhna2ZjUl9Ja0VJS2pxLXlXRmMzVkc2ZzNTQXNISWYzeUNnOVN1UlYtd0NaUzVhRDI4ZFVXOGhQYV9hY2c</guid></item><item><title>青少年正试图大量摄入蛋白质补充剂。父母应该注意什么？ - NPR | Teens are trying to bulk up on protein supplements.

                &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/a&gt; last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year. Boys took it to bulk up; girls took it to replace meals.

   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky, 17, joined Santa Monica High School's football team as a freshman and — at the urging of coaches and teammates— started hitting the gym whenever possible: in the morning, after school, and on the weekends. The people he met there would share their strategies for bulking up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They would take protein powders, other supplements like some people I know take ashwagandha, and maybe creatine," he says, citing popular energy and exercise-enhancing supplements. Emiliano started taking some of them, too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But his dad, Eduardo Slesaransky, wanted to make sure his son's diet — and attitude — remained balanced: "My concern was the influence that social media has on these supplements and these kinds of things and the culture of body building and the gyms."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Protein supplements are big on social media, where&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;influencers are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;helping drive sales of protein bars, shakes and powders. &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/reports/teens-and-protein" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A poll of parents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan last fall found 40% of teens consumed some type of protein supplement in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Teen boys were more likely — twice as likely — to consume protein every day," says &lt;a href="https://chear.org/people/faculty-investigators/sarah-clark" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sarah Clark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research scientist and co-director of &lt;a href="https://mottpoll.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the poll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Girls, she says, more often relied on supplements as meal replacements, and the inspiration to consume protein shakes, bars or powders often came from coaches, peers, or influencers on social media. But Clark says parents were also among those promoting protein to their children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I wonder if, as parents, we are recognizing how much messaging we have taken in about protein being good," she says. "We have absorbed this messaging: That's the key to being healthy," she says, when in fact it is only one factor in a balanced, healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-78474" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                The vast majority of teens already get enough protein in their diet without supplements, pediatric dietician Abriana Cain says.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How much is enough? &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is also such a thing as &lt;em&gt;too much &lt;/em&gt;protein, says Abriana Cain, a &lt;a href="https://www.childrensnational.org/get-care/departments/clinical-nutrition-services/meet-the-team" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pediatric dietician with Children's National Hospital&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C. As a general rule, Cain tells teens and parents to gauge protein intake based on size — benchmarked at roughly 1 gram of protein a day per kilogram of body weight. (For a 150-pound teen, that amounts to about 68 grams of protein per day — or the rough equivalent of a cup of cooked chicken, a cup of yogurt, and a cup of black beans.)&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"It might even increase from there, based on their physical activity needs," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cain says more than 100 grams a day can damage the kidney and liver in the longer term. It can also cause stomach pain, as it did for one of her patients. "They were eating protein supplements with all of their meals and also with all of their snacks, and they were having a lot of abdominal pain."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of teens, Cain says, already get enough protein in their diet without supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about the marketing of supplements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is no quality control for these products, notes pediatrician and eating disorder expert Dr. &lt;a href="https://nagatalab.ucsf.edu/people/jason-nagata-md" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jason Nagata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at the University of California San Francisco. Supplements, including protein bars and powders, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/information-consumers-using-dietary-supplements/questions-and-answers-dietary-supplements#:~:text=The%20Dietary%20Supplement%20Health%20and%20Education%20Act%20(DSHEA)%20amended%20the,has%20not%20been%20chemically%20altered." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;u&gt; regulated by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — so they're not tested, and their ingredients aren't verified.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think it's important for teens and parents to know that there isn't that kind of rigorous quality control, especially when you're getting mixtures of muscle building supplements and products," he says. "I would just be very cautious."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nagata advises researching, reading ingredient labels and buying directly from known companies. Some products have been found to have contaminants such as heavy metals, bacteria, or chemicals or adulterants not listed on the label.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Eating disorders are up&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Separately, Nagata is concerned that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7483647/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protein craze is contributing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2812520?utm_campaign=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_medium=articlePDFlink&amp;amp;utm_source=articlePDF&amp;amp;utm_content=jamanetworkopen.2023.46012" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alarming &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813513#:~:text=A%20study%20in%20Canada%20of,of%20improved%20screening%20and%20detection." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increase in eating disorders among boys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over the past two decades, worldwide. He observes that over that time period, action figures like Batman and Superman are sold with bigger muscles, and pressures on ordinary teenagers to post attractive photos of themselves to be popular online have increased.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"The masculine body ideal has become increasingly large and muscular, and so more and more boys are trying to become muscular now than they have ever before," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emiliano Slesaransky stopped using protein powders about a year ago, he says, largely because he started forgetting to take it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His father, Eduardo, says his son still looks very strong and fit, but is no longer fixated with bulking up for sports. "He's focusing on getting into college."&lt;/p&gt;

As such, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective anticancer compounds, particularly those derived from medicinal plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the study reveal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the research team used a specific bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T, to ferment stevia leaves. They compared the fermented version (which they call FSLE) to regular stevia extract and found that FSLE performed better in every way they tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Masanori Sugiyama explained, “To enhance the pharmacological efficacy of natural plant extracts, microbial biotransformation has emerged as an effective strategy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They optimized the fermentation process and found that stevia was most effective when fermented for 72 hours, at 37°C, without oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were impressive: fermented stevia effectively killed pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1) while barely affecting healthy cells, even at higher doses. This selectivity is crucial for safe cancer treatments. Instead of an immediate kill, FSLE sometimes slowed down cancer cell growth, making them look weak and unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia also showed strong antioxidant properties, which is essential since oxidative stress is a big factor in cancer development. It neutralized free radicals more effectively than the non-fermented version, achieving a 94% scavenging power in one test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s the takeaway?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that fermentation transforms compounds into more active versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a compound called chlorogenic acid is converted into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME) during fermentation. CAME was found to be more effective than regular chlorogenic acid in halting cancer cell growth and triggering cancer cell self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its potency was significant: the dose needed to kill half the cancer cells was much lower for CAME compared to regular chlorogenic acid. CAME works by blocking the cell cycle and forcing cells into apoptosis, their self-destruct mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a genetic level, CAME influenced genes associated with cell death, activating pro-apoptotic genes while shutting down those that prevent cell death. This supports the observed effects, showing that CAME doesn’t just kill cells randomly; it drives them into a specific self-destruction pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up in simpler terms, this research suggests that fermented stevia could be a promising new avenue for effective cancer treatment, particularly for hard-to-treat pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is stevia?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is a sweet sugar substitute that is about 50 to 300 times sweeter than sugar. It is extracted from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, a plant (shrub) native to tropical and subtropical America, and areas of Paraguay and Brazil. The active compounds in stevia are steviol glycosides, and the leaves may be used as a calorie-free substitute for sugar. Stevia is heat-stable, pH-stable, and not fermentable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than just a sweetener:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia is not just a substitute for sugar anymore; it’s stepping up its game!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to fermentation, researchers have discovered that stevia extract can be transformed into a compound that fights cancer while leaving healthy cells unharmed. This exciting change is linked to specific enzymes from a bacterial strain called SN13T. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Danshiitsoodol, “This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that this new compound, CAME, is more effective at harming cancer cells and promoting cell death in PANC-1 cells than chlorogenic acid alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The way ahead:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next for this research? The team has plans to take their work from the lab to the real world, with mouse studies coming up. This will test if fermented stevia can work within living systems, which have complex immune responses and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Danshiitsoodol, “The present study has substantially enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of action of the Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T strain in the fermentation of herbal extracts, while also offering a valuable research perspective on the potential application of probiotics as natural anti-tumor agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going by this research, with the right microbes, even a simple leaf like stevia could become a powerful weapon against cancer. It’s not bad for a sugar substitute anymore; it’s a natural and valuable component with more than its sweetening qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer immunotherapy may also treat certain autoimmune diseases, claims study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 06:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>外科医生在拯救生命的婴儿器官移植中复苏“死”心脏- ScienceAlert | Surgeons Resuscitate 'Dead' Heart in Life-Saving Organ Transplant to Baby - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOQnUwTzl1TloxN2lnN2phWkVNaEdEV2x4NkEtdkFzeXpuY0ZYRkVxNkxTd2Z4M1AzdFc0a3Ftbk1TczhCaUVZQTVKM3VqUjh5MHRzZFByckpMSHI1azhzVWpTWTdUOFhQUUZZcExNYWNURzN5cERtN01nNTRfNDFZcG1QaS1zOFNWUTJqa2FDbUVZcTFYaU9PeTAwMHljOW05Mnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Surgeons at Duke University have resuscitated a 'dead' heart on the operating table after it stopped beating for more than five minutes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The organ was later transplanted into the chest of a three-month-old child, saving their life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infant with the donor heart continued to show normal cardiac function and no signs of organ rejection at six months of age, according to a brief report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eerie-personality-changes-sometimes-happen-after-organ-transplants?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Eerie Personality Changes Sometimes Happen After Organ Transplants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The story is proof that the concept of 'on-table reanimation' works at preserving hearts for transplantation – at least for infants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the consent of the donor family, surgeons reinvigorated a small donor heart on the operating table using an oxygenator, a centrifugal pump, and a hanging reservoir to collect expelled blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This contraption had to be custom-designed, as current care systems that keep organs alive outside of bodies are too big for infant hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today in the United States, up to 20 percent of infants in need will die waiting for a heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most organ donors must be declared brain dead before donation. Only 0.5 percent of pediatric heart transplants are donated after circulatory death, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;when the heart stops beating and blood stops circulating.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some critics do not think it is morally correct to take &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/exclusives/100950"&gt;a terminal patient off life support&lt;/a&gt;, get their heart beating again, and then remove it for transplantation. Concerns arise over declarations of death, and how to reanimate organs in an ethical way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After circulatory death, donor hearts can be re-oxygenated while they are still in the donor body, or they can be resuscitated on the operating table using machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png" alt="Organ Donation" class="size-medium wp-image-168331" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-642x390.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-683x415.png 683w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-768x467.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1-600x365.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/HF-EA-Lee-Pretorius-Fig1.png 1430w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168331" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Organ donation sources and techniques.

They also note that using organs after circulatory death has the potential to increase the donor pool by up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another team of surgeons at Vanderbilt University has a different idea. They have devised a way to avoid the most common ethical concerns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their technique doesn't seek to immediately reanimate donor hearts; instead, it preserves them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent brief report, the team explains that with&lt;span&gt; an aorta clamp and a cold-preserving flush of liquid, they successfully recovered three donor hearts for transplantation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By clamping off the heart's circulatory system, the team kept their work separate from the donor's brain (which raises ethical concerns over resuscitation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our technique flushes oxygenated preservation solution to the donor heart only, without reanimation of the heart and without systemic or brain perfusion," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In initial surgeries, the technique showed "excellent early postoperative outcomes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three donor hearts were successfully transplanted with healthy function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This method of heart recovery offers the possibility of broad application," the Vanderbilt surgeons &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2503487"&gt;Duke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2500456"&gt;Vanderbilt&lt;/a&gt; reports were both published in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, doctors have witnessed a disturbing trend linked with colon cancer, which traditionally is viewed as a disease of older adults, but is increasingly striking people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is a type of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cancer-alert-if-these-10-symptoms-last-more-than-a-few-weeks-it-is-advisable-to-get-checked/photostory/122807750.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cancer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.

One clinical trial (published earlier this year in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerpreventionresearch/article/18/4/235/754306/Systemic-Inflammation-and-the-Inflammatory-Context" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer Prevention Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;) showed 28 g of walnuts daily reduced inflammation markers and vimentin levels, proteins tied to aggressive colon tumors. Furthermore, as Dr. Salhab references, in stage III colon cancer patients, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2017.75.5413" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; shows, eating two servings of tree nuts daily reduced disease recurrence by 42%. Aim for a daily nut handful or mix walnuts into trail mix or oatmeal for an antioxidant boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apples&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;An apple a day might even keep the big C (cancer) at bay. Apples, especially with their skin, offer soluble and insoluble fiber plus flavonoids.

Fiber aids bowel regularity and toxin removal, while phytonutrients support gut health. Snack on apple slices with almond butter or part of a lunch fruit salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydrating and fiber‑rich citrus fruits, like oranges, grapefruits, and clementines, are not only high in fiber, but their water content, vitamins, and bioactive compounds also add to their numerous health benefits. A study, published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55219-5?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, shows citrus intake may decrease colorectal cancer risk by up to 18%. The combination of antioxidants, fiber, and hydration supports digestion and reduces carcinogen exposure in the colon. Moreover, you can enjoy them fresh, in smoothies, or sprinkled in salads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watermelon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Made of over 90% water, watermelon aids hydration and regular digestion. This luscious fruit is not only crucial for colon health, but the lycopene and antioxidants in watermelon contribute anti-inflammatory benefits, slashing the risk of colorectal cancer considerably. What’s more? Fresh watermelon slices or blended into agua fresca are a refreshing addition to your daily diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Salsa and guacamole&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one, we hardly see it coming! Tomato-based salsa provides lycopene and fiber, while avocado adds monounsaturated fats, fiber (about 10 g per medium avocado), and antioxidants. Mix them together for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8270321/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a gut‑health powerhouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. As per research, superfruit avocado consumption has been shown to lower colon cancer risk. Moreover, tomatoes and avocados together offer synergistic benefits.

It's the place where you're likely spending most of your time, and if it's not promoting healthy habits, a consistent routine, or peacefulness, you're going to feel drained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From hurting sleep quality, to sabotaging connection, heightening stress, and even negatively impacting physical well-being, the little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy are significant, yet difficult to notice in the grand scheme of things. Many may be overspending on objects or allowing certain things into their space without even realizing they're negatively impacting their own mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 little things deeply unhappy people have in their homes that anyone else would never buy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1.

Not only can this add up substantially, especially for people in an already uncertain financial situation, but indulging these subscriptions and services on a daily basis out of guilt for spending on them can negatively impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does mindless entertainment and passive activities like watching TV &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11939997/" rel="nofollow"&gt;tend to damper our mood and well-being&lt;/a&gt;, trying to cope with insecurity, discomfort, or emotional turmoil with distractions like turning on the TV &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/29/1/zmad056/7582213" rel="nofollow"&gt;or doomscrolling on our phones&lt;/a&gt; can be incredibly harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/things-brilliant-people-do-whenever-tempted-doomscroll"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8 Things Brilliant People Do Whenever They're Tempted To Doomscroll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

They may feed into trend cycles and adopt toxic consumerist habits to feel like they belong — like buying clothes from social media — even if it adds more financial strain and isolation to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/self/people-with-great-emotional-intelligence-usually-have-these-things-in-their-home"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People With Great Emotional Intelligence Usually Have These 11 Things In Their Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4.

Not only is it a constant reminder of a habit you're struggling to keep up with, sparking shame and guilt in your everyday life, it's expensive and financially draining, especially for people already struggling with money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it may be one of the last things an unhappy person wants to indulge, it can be the difference-maker for breaking bad habits and disrupting the cycle of depression they've fallen victim to.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Morgan Birch A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Morgan Birch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;How measles spread in Canada&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community," Ms Friesen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations.

Ms Birch then consulted her 78-year-old grandmother, who recognised Kimie's illness immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That's measles," her grandmother said. Ms Birch was stunned, as she thought the disease had been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;A lab test later confirmed her grandmother's hypothesis: Kimie had measles, likely contracted after a routine visit to the hospital in the Edmonton area a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie is one of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://health-infobase.canada.ca/measles-rubella/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;more than 3,800 in Canada who have been infected with measles&lt;/a&gt; in 2025, most of them children and infants. That figure is nearly three times higher than &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the number of confirmed US cases&lt;/a&gt;, despite Canada's far smaller population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Now Canada is the only western country listed among the top 10 with measles outbreaks, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, ranking at number eight. Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a postdoctoral fellow in public health at Western University in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think," Dr Smith said. "Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, its highest count since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Morgan Birch A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles." class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Morgan Birch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;How measles spread in Canada&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community," Ms Friesen told the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you," Ms Friesen said, or are "dangerous".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background," she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;Vaccine hesitancy on the rise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg," said Dr Suttorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Shapiro said there is "an element of chance" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up," she said. "If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called "Freedom Convoy" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations. With measles having been largely eliminated, families likely did not prioritise getting their kids' vaccinations up to date, Dr Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;That is not the case for Ms Birch, who began routine immunisations for her baby Kimie as soon as she was eligible. But Kimie was still too young for the measles vaccine, which is typically given at 12 months in Alberta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Suttorp said Alberta has since lowered that age cap in response to the recent outbreak, and there has been an uptick in people taking the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Health units across the country have also tried to encourage people to get vaccinated through public bulletins and radio advertisements. But the response is notably more muted than that during the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Kimie has since slowly recovered, Ms Birch said, though she continues to be monitored for potential long-term effects of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Alberta mother said she was saddened and horrified when she learned her daughter had measles, but also "frustrated and annoyed" at those choosing not to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She called on people to heed public health guidelines and "protect the ones that can't protect themselves".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"My four-month-old shouldn't have gotten measles in 2025," Ms Birch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 00:50:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9mNDVwYzgzanoxbDBoLVhRaENVWXFLc3NNMUdPTnhuUEx4WU5xQVJ1YmVPTWMtYXZ2VksyMVBWU2h0djNiY05oSTlnWmFucU5xNEY3cWhiWVRXZw</guid></item><item><title>与癌症疾病相关的刷牙.. -大安得拉邦 | Brushing Teeth Linked To Cancer Disease.. - Great Andhra</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNOTJ2LVVhT253Y0xTSkxKU2tUaHlBajB1RW1Id1poN1Nrb3hVR2RlUGV2Rm9ydTk0MmxqYnZXMFZ3R1hKQ0Y3elFVaWxXQzNyRXJQbWEtc01OM011aHo1MkJnMkdDTFB5allRMHUxOHRtLU9FY3F4TjQ5NHRWUXJEMWI2b1B5RS1ralBNX2NFcmdhVkZzSlVucnpSVDlrdTlYcUHSAZABQVVfeXFMTXhzSjNhdkYtak03WU9GZzNtY0VfY3gyYXdtdDhCQ0J2UG11Ukc4REFpQnV3WU5wNUhqRFBpUjJWT1NvUlp5bXRrLVBPVl9vcm5IMDV4RHlORE5jaEI1ZGpuYXlIZnQwd2p0aDJXaVJHWlRCT1ZoWTB6X2JleGxoMTJSbzZfYVptT29VQ1VqU0N6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="unselectable"&gt;

					
						
												&lt;p&gt;A recent AIIMS Delhi study highlights the critical role of oral health in preventing and managing serious illnesses, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers emphasized that oral hygiene practices must be integrated into all levels of healthcare, not just at the primary level, to improve overall health outcomes and reduce disease risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidence links poor oral hygiene with conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and especially cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gum disease, in particular, shows strong association with cancers of the head, neck, lungs, breast and digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from international studies revealed that routine dental care, like brushing daily and visiting the dentist annually; can reduce the risk of head and neck cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer treatment, especially radiotherapy, significantly affects oral health. Patients with poor gum health face higher complications after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, maintaining oral hygiene before, during and after therapy is essential for better recovery and survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study calls for better data from South Asia, awareness campaigns, school-based brushing programs and policies restricting sugar and tobacco promotions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recommend that WHO South-East Asia Region implement affordable, evidence, based oral health programs to reduce cancer risks and health inequalities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public awareness, supervised brushing and policy changes could help transform oral healthcare in India and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

We were grappling with the fact that Ben had gone from being apparently perfectly healthy to having months to live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Had we not met Dr Mulholland, that would have been it for us. We felt we had a lucky break in an otherwise devastating situation.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ben Trotman, 43, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma in October 2022, is now showing no signs of the disease after being administered an immunotherapy drug in a world first two years ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Most patients with the aggressive form of brain cancer typically die within 12-to-18 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Trotman went on to have the current standard treatment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. He also undergoes quarterly cans, which continue to return clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We obviously don't know what the future holds but having had the immunotherapy treatment and getting these encouraging scan results has given Emily and I a bit of hope,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are focused on rebuilding the life we thought we had lost and enjoying being parents'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trial, from University College London Hospital's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, follows a previous one on the same drug which closed because of lack of recruitment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dame Siobhain McDonagh MP lead a fundraising campaign to raise more than £1million to cover the costs of the new trials after her sister, Baroness McDonagh, died from glioblastoma in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dame Siobhain said: 'My beloved sister Margaret was appalled to discover that there had been no advances in brain cancer treatment for decades when she was diagnosed with glioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Changing this was Margaret's final campaign and one that I have continued in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am so grateful to the many people who knew and respected Margaret who have come together and helped to raise funds and campaign for this new trial that we are calling Margaret's Trial.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Paul Mulholland said: 'When I met Margaret she said to me 'what can I do to support you to cure this disease?'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Paul Mulholland with Dame Siobhan McDonagh.

The tend to come on really, really quickly, within a matter of seconds. You don't usually have a warning and they will knock you down to the floor until they're over.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller, who lives in Montana, spent much of his adult life suffering attacks up to four times a day for months at a time until they suddenly disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His clusters have slowed in recent years, but like the 1 in 1,000 Americans with the disorder, Zeller waits for the next attack with limited tools at his disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his newly released book, &lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction – and a Search for Relief&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Zeller detailed his decades–long search for cluster headache relief, along with the wackiest things he's tried to quell the pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Journalist Tom Zeller Jr's new book explores treatments and causes of cluster headaches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I never wanted to write this book, to be honest. I did not want people to know I had headaches. It's just terrible to be seen in this way,' Zeller told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I also felt like if you're going to write a book, they say, "Write about what you know." I realized that I know headaches.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cluster headaches are extremely painful and strike quickly in frequent attacks, or 'clusters,' lasting weeks or months at a time, earning the grim nickname 'suicide headaches.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disorder usually causes sharp and stabbing pain in or around the eye, restlessness, tears and eye redness, forehead sweating, swelling around the eye and eyelid drooping. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14579791/migraines-surprising-cure-effects-doctor-free.html"&gt;close relative of migraines&lt;/a&gt;, they're far less common. About 0.1 percent of Americans have had a cluster headache attack at some point in their lives, while 15 percent – most of whom are women – have migraines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Zeller, the attacks drove a wedge in his journalism career, often forcing him to 'retreat from opportunities in the newsroom.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not easy. The book talks about how any sort of headache disorder is kind of a drag on the momentum of your life. They're always slowing you down,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I wasn't having the headaches, I felt like I was pretty bold and pretty accomplished as a journalist. But when the headaches would come on, I would sort of disappear and I would work from home a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cluster headaches affect one in 1,000 Americans and cause debilitating pain (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a lot of stigma attached to headaches in a weird way. I tried very hard to make sure that no one knew that I had these headaches. You start to hide and that meant hiding from opportunities at work too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Throughout the book, Zeller detailed a laundry list of unorthodox treatments he tried or researched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was being ground down by the relentless injections, self–administered into an abdomen bruised and pockmarked by previous jabs, and overuse of the medication was likely driving an endless cycle of rebound attacks,' he wrote in his book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Given this unappealing tableau, why not shrooms?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, has been shown to alter how the brain processes and perceives pain signals and is thought to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's also tried inhaling capsaicin, an extract in chili peppers that gives them their signature heat. Some research suggests it helps desensitize nerve fibers in the nasal passages that transmit cluster headache pain to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller also rented oxygen tanks from a welding supplier as a 'really fast way to abort a cluster headache attack.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I also remember a forum saying that if you just tried to chug like 60 glasses of water a day, or some absurd amount, it would cure your headaches. I was willing to try, but all I did was visit the toilet a lot with headaches,' he recalled. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller said many patients with cluster headaches have to rely on bizarre hacks because of the lack of medications geared specifically toward their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured is the cover of Tom Zeller Jr's book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The thing that surprised me most, and what probably prompted the book, was that so little research was out there on primary headache disorders,' Zeller explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are often prescribed beta blockers, antipsychotics, antidepressants and other drugs manufactured for other illnesses, as they can treat headaches in some people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recently, the advent of CGRP drugs has changed the picture. Approved by the FDA in 2018, these preventative drugs block or reduce the effects of CGRP, which causes migraine and cluster headache pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A lot of times you'll find a drug or remedy that does kind of work, but the body adapts. We're very plastic, and over time, those things start to wane,' Zeller said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller uses the CGRP medication Emgality, the only FDA approved medication specifically designed for cluster headaches and migraines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cluster headache dose of Emgality is significantly higher than the migraine dose – 300 milligrams compared to 120 milligrams – and both versions are given through a subcutaneous injection just under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cluster headaches are their own unique animal, so once the headaches start happening, it does seem to be pretty hard to stop,' Zeller revealed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I think three times in I'm sort of convinced that the CGRP blockers work for me to stop a bout from happening.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The book opens with him tripping on magic mushrooms for cluster headaches (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like migraines, cluster headaches often become less frequent and severe with age, which some research suggests could be due to hormonal fluctuations and altered blood vessel function in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Zeller's clusters in recent years have slowed and can now fall years apart, but he's far from being in remission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I don't think I, or anyone really, is out of the woods yet,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For now, Zeller said he hopes his new book will help improve cluster headache awareness and provide a sense of community for readers with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his research, he spoke with several cluster headache and migraine patients who at first were 'guarded' and wary of speaking about their experience over fears of it being trivialized. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But throughout the interviews, they became excited because they had 'this pent–up desire to just unload about it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I hope they feel seen by the book,' Zeller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Someone out there is paying attention and you can take heart in that, and if you're able to buy time between painful bouts, I hope that you know the book will be affirming in that you know you're not alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;The Headache: The Science of a Most Confounding Affliction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds provide fiber, omega-3s and antioxidants that can help lower cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds are versatile, cost-effective and easy to incorporate into a heart-healthy diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating plant-based foods, exercising and not smoking are also important for better cholesterol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to lowering cholesterol levels, lifestyle changes are key. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292224/high-cholesterol-diet-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;High cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, or hypercholesterolemia, occurs when excess cholesterol is present in the blood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vandanasheth.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES, FAND&lt;/a&gt; says, “High cholesterol is linked to diet, genetics and lifestyle. Over time, this can increase your risk for heart disease.” The good news is that even just a few simple tweaks to your diet can make a big difference in managing your cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, adding a sprinkle of chia seeds to your meals is an easy way to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;boost your intake of soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; and healthy fats—key nutrients for lowering cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In fact, one review showed that consuming 35 grams (about 2.5 tablespoons) of chia seeds per day led to noticeable reductions  in LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the control group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Here, registered dietitians explain why chia seeds are the #1 food to eat more of if you have high cholesterol, along with other strategies for managing your levels. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seeds-benefits-11705262" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are the edible seeds of the &lt;em&gt;Salvia hispanica&lt;/em&gt; plant and are an impressive source of dietary fiber, plant-based protein, antioxidants, omega‐3 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They’re also naturally low in saturated fat and easy to incorporate into meals and snacks. Here are some of the reasons why adding chia seeds to your diet may be beneficial if you have high cholesterol.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; They Provide an Ample Amount of Fiber  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are rich in fiber, with a 2-tablespoon serving providing 10 grams of fiber, including 1.5 grams of soluble fiber. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to help lower cholesterol by binding to cholesterol in the small intestine and removing it from your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “When chia seed is mixed with water, the soluble fiber forms a gel called &lt;em&gt;mucilage,&lt;/em&gt; which can help transport cholesterol out of the body through the digestive tract,” says &lt;a href="http://kristydelcoro.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kristy Del Coro, MS, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. Research suggests that consuming at least 5–10 grams of soluble fiber per day may reduce LDL cholesterol by 5.5–11 mg per deciliter.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another impressive benefit of chia seeds is their rich concentration of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an essential fatty acid with anti-inflammatory effects.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Chia seeds are rich in plant-based &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fats&lt;/a&gt;, which positively support heart health,” says Sheth. Research suggests that ALA can help lower total and LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It may also help increase HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, though the findings weren’t significant.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are simple to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;incorporate into a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; and are relatively inexpensive—especially if you buy them in bulk. Akerman notes that while the price varies by brand, chia seeds are generally cost-effective as you’ll likely only use a tablespoon or two at a time.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds can be added to virtually any dish, from creamy overnight oats to dinner-sized salads. “Add chia seeds to a smoothie, mix into a yogurt, soak overnight in soy milk (also good for lowering cholesterol) to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chia-seed-pudding-8430793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;make a chia pudding&lt;/a&gt; or use [them] in granola. Powder form can be used in baked goods, bread or cracker doughs, oatmeal or smoothies,” says Del Coro. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overnight chia seed pudding is Sheth’s favorite recipe for a delicious, heart-healthy breakfast or snack. She varies up the milk (almond, soy) and adds fresh fruit (berries, mango, stone fruit) and a small handful of chopped nuts (pistachios, walnuts, almonds). You can also sprinkle chia seeds over a slice of avocado toast, add them to a classic PB&amp;amp;J or use them to make a DIY &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/homemade-protein-powder-11713647" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein powder&lt;/a&gt;. Just make sure to add chia seeds gradually into your diet and drink plenty of water to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dangers-of-chia-seeds-11717491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;digestive side effects&lt;/a&gt;, like bloating or gas. Sheth notes that this is particularly important if you’re not used to eating a high-fiber diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unopened, chia seeds can last up to 5 years when stored in a cool, dry place, like a pantry or cabinet. Once opened, Akerman recommends storing chia seeds in an airtight container in the fridge to extend their shelf life and prevent them from going rancid. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Certain risk factors for high cholesterol, like your genetics, age and family history, are outside of your control. However, there are several lifestyle changes you can make to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cardiologist-recommendations-for-high-cholesterol-8715965" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;help lower your cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and support heart health. Here are three strategies to try:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Eat more plants  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sheth recommends filling your plate with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7943524/plant-based-low-cholesterol-dinner-plan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt; and heart-healthy fats, like olive oil, to help lower cholesterol. Whole, minimally processed plant-based foods, like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds and legumes, are packed with beneficial nutrients for heart health and cholesterol levels. In addition to providing fiber, healthy fats, antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals, they’re also typically low in saturated fat. Compared to omnivorous diets, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vegan and vegetarian diets&lt;/a&gt; have been associated with lower total and LDL cholesterol levels and a reduced risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Move your body  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Akerman highlights the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-may-reduce-heart-disease-by-lowering-stress-response-8635621" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;importance of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. Regular exercise is shown to increase HDL and lower LDL levels. To help prevent or reduce high cholesterol, the American Heart Association recommends engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense cardiovascular exercise per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swimming, cycling, running and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8042248/walking-plan-to-lower-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brisk walking&lt;/a&gt; are all classic examples of aerobic exercise. Dancing, hiking, vigorous yard work and gardening also count. If you’re new to exercise, it’s important to talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Do not smoke  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Smoking and vaping can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-break-for-lower-cholesterol-8749670" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower HDL cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Smoking can also increase the risk of heart disease by increasing triglyceride levels and other health conditions associated with high cholesterol, like diabetes and high blood pressure. If you currently smoke, reach out to a healthcare professional for guidance and resources on how to quit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds contain soluble fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, all of which can help improve &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7877576/what-you-need-to-know-about-your-cholesterol-levels/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and support overall heart health. Besides being incredibly nutritious, these tiny but mighty seeds are also easy to use, versatile and relatively inexpensive, making them an excellent addition to your pantry (or fridge). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no one food&lt;/a&gt; can magically improve your cholesterol levels. Eating an overall healthy diet that’s rich in minimally processed plant-based foods, moving your body daily and not smoking are also key. Cholesterol-lowering medications may also be necessary for some folks. Regardless of where you start, identify at least one or two changes you can make today to start moving towards a more heart-healthy lifestyle.

Controlling blood sugar levels can help benefit the treatment of &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/obesity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes and obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes and obesity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/experts-reveal-5-step-approach-healthier-gut-stronger-immunity" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Experts Reveal 5-Step Approach To A Healthier Gut And Stronger Immunity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Experts Reveal 5-Step Approach To A Healthier Gut And Stronger Immunity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research published in the journal Nutrients found that patients who followed the meal sequencing method — eating vegetables before refined carbohydrates — showed a significant improvement in glycemic control and blood sugar after a five-year period, while the group that did not follow the approach did not show improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What causes the sugar spikes is eating too many carbs," Sandra J. Arevalo, a New York-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eating them alone makes it even worse," she cautioned. "When eating them together with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and fiber;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;protein and fiber&lt;/a&gt;, we are cushioning their effect by slowing their absorption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight loss;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that eating protein before refined carbs promotes the secretion of the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the gut, which delays gastric emptying and suppresses appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;In addition to lowering blood sugar levels, meal sequencing may also assist with weight loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat other foods first — mainly fiber-rich foods — and then you &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/water" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:drink water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;drink water&lt;/a&gt;, the fiber from the foods helps you feel satisfied, thus decreasing your appetite," Arevalo told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And let’s not forget that fiber also helps to reduce the absorption of sugar in the blood, helping to cushion your sugar levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complex carbohydrates — such as most vegetables, beans and legumes — are rich in fiber and slow to digest, which causes a gradual rise in blood sugar levels, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined carbohydrates — such as sugar, white rice and white flour — have higher glycemic levels, which are easier to break down and contribute to faster blood sugar spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As nutrition experts pointed out, eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:during digestion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;during digestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Eating fiber before refined carbohydrates can help slow the carbs’ absorption, which helps blood sugar levels stay lower during digestion.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assist with healthier food choices and to monitor blood sugar levels after a meal, experts recommend using a food rating system called the glycemic index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rating scale determines how quickly certain foods can cause blood sugars to rise and fall, according to the UCLA report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those interested in trying &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/diet-trends" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:meal sequencing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, Susie laid out the following steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with eating non-starchy vegetables first, as the fiber slows digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat protein and healthy fats.

			&lt;p&gt;Keep calm and try &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega-3_fatty_acid"&gt;omega-3&lt;/a&gt;. The fatty acids, available as dietary supplements via fish oil capsules and thought to help with mental and physical well-being, could also cut down on aggression, according to a 2024 study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings haven't come out of nowhere: omega-3 has previously been linked to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fish-oil-helps-at-risk-teenagers-avoid-schizophrenia-even-8-years-later"&gt;preventing schizophrenia&lt;/a&gt;, while aggression and antisocial behavior are thought in part to stem from a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/190990"&gt;lack of nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. What we eat can influence our brain's chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania built on earlier, smaller studies of omega-3 supplementation effects on aggression.

Before this study, it wasn't clear if omega-3 could help with these different types of aggression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While larger studies across longer periods of time are going to be needed to further establish this relationship, it adds to our understanding of how fish oil pills and the omega-3 in them might be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-kids-with-adhd-may-see-improvement-with-fish-oil-pills-but-results-are-mixed"&gt;beneficial for the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the very least, parents seeking treatment for an aggressive child should know that in addition to any other treatment that their child receives, an extra portion or two of fish each week could also help," Raine &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_149436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ExamplesOfFoodsThatHaveOmega3-e1736917333981.jpeg" alt="One Dietary Supplement Found to Reduce Aggression by Up to 28%" class="size-full wp-image-149436" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-149436" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Natural sources of omega-3 in foods. (Ekaterina Kapranova/iStock/Getty Images Plus)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think something in the way that omega-3 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327816302198"&gt;reduces inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and keeps vital brain processes &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3820"&gt;ticking over&lt;/a&gt; might be helping regulate aggression. There are still a lot of unanswered questions, but the team suggests there's enough evidence to look into this further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2154"&gt;the studies that show&lt;/a&gt; that medications derived from fish oil can help reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks, strokes, and other heart health problems, and there seems to be plenty of upside to adding some omega-3 to your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 is not a magic bullet that is going to completely solve the problem of violence in society," &lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/time-has-come-implement-omega-3-supplementation-reduce-aggression"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But can it help?

There has been a consistent yearly growth rate of 10.7% in this sector, showed the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts offer a slew of reasons for this rise, ranging from better awareness of heart diseases, new parameters for measuring hypertension as well as the increasing population of senior citizens. “There is no doubt that cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, but at the same time, access to care and diagnostic tools has improved," said Dr Ajay Mahajan, head of the cardiology department at KEM Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Medical guidelines have since changed and even readings above 120 are considered hypertensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While heart care until a few years back mainly meant lipid-lowering medications, the prescriptions for other drugs meant to control unstable heart rhythm or heart failure have also increased. “Cardiovascular medications are interrelated because they target different but connected pathways of disease,” said senior cardiac surgeon Dr Ramakanta Panda. “For example, anti-hypertensives lower blood pressure to reduce the strain on arteries and the heart. Lipid-lowering drugs like statins reduce cholesterol helping prevent arterial blockages. Anti-anginals improve blood flow to the heart muscle, relieving chest pain caused by narrowed arteries. These medications are often prescribed together," said Dr Panda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the frequent reports of cardiac arrest deaths among common people as well as celebrities and fitness enthusiasts, KEM cardiologist Dr Charan Lanjewar said underlying factors are almost always involved. “There’s a lack of data to identify a single cause in many cardiac arrest cases. The reasons are multifactorial, but lifestyle, stress, and consumption habits play a vital role,” Dr Lanjewar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aging population is more prone to heart conditions. Senior cardiologist Dr Akshay Mehta said, “The lifespan of the Indian population has increased and with a growing aging population, we are seeing a higher incidence of heart disease. Along with rising incidence, we also have better diagnostic tools now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 22:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>编辑《花花公子》，与帕金森一起生活-《泰晤士报》 | Editing Playboy, living with Parkinson’s - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPazZ2X3FPb01lc1pwVEs5SVJzd3Vpemo4VWI2VGJ5a1llVlp1RFY0Y3RrRF9HUVZPR3JUQmgtS0hlWmJrdG1MaHZhdHV3bUlpRG8zeEp0OG1mMDBGTlBUY3VrTzMydDBPSXdNNHVETlFDcHAwdDAtWnhXOGpMQlBlTHhLZDgwWUF1ejh1YUdlV0pKRkNkdkx0Vnk0ZDhCd005bUI2MHUwZ0k2OGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;It was among the “high rollers” at one such symposium that Jan Heemskerk, then the editor of Dutch Playboy, found his compatriot Playmate on set in floods of tears. Apparently, his star model and the photographer were at loggerheads. “I took the woman for a beer to talk it through,” recalls Heemskerk, 62. “It was literally only afterwards, as I walked away, that it dawned on me she was&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt; completely naked. I thought: I’ve been in this job too long.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="paywall-EAB47CFD"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If Heemskerk — a well-known media figure who, before helming Playboy, launched the Dutch version of the lads’ monthly FHM and another glossy called MAN — was inured to the excesses of men’s publishing during its sozzled last hurrah in the Noughties, his family history may hold the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/lily-phillips-interview-sex-101-men-sxpfdhhkj" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lily Phillips: Don’t blame me for how men have sex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His father, Jan Heemskerk Sr, had been the editor of Dutch Playboy before him, even causing a political scandal in the mid-1980s when he published photographs of two (very!) liberal Dutch parliamentarians eyeing each other up in the House of Representatives, then disporting themselves in bed and in the shower. Heemskerk says his dad was less than enthusiastic about his son assuming the Playboy mantle — “F*** no” was his response to news of the appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Both men had dealings with Playboy’s founder, &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/hugh-hefner-widow-crystal-marriage-brainswashed-wm0kzmh6c" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Hugh Hefner&lt;/a&gt;. “He was a small guy — the translator towered over him but when he started talking he was mesmerising,” recalls the wiry Heemskerk. “He oozed power and intelligence … and then the other side of him was just a dirty old man.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.5"&gt;&lt;div id="12a72786-de23-4b3f-a8c3-a0527eeb5035"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;In his Playboy days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;EYEVINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Heemskerk resigned in pique from his editorship of the Dutch organ in 2012, half a decade before the Playboy empire would have to reckon with fallout pertaining to the &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/world/article/playboy-founder-high-hefner-accused-of-drugging-and-secretly-filming-bunnies-5ksxzsp8p" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;most sordid aspects of Hefner’s life&lt;/a&gt; — among them allegations of drugging, coercion and using his power to silence women — in the wake of #MeToo. During Heemskerk’s tenure, the principal challenge for Playboy was one of competing with what we shall euphemistically refer to as “the possibilities of the internet”. Newsstand cover lines from the period before his departure — “The jokes page is back!” — speak to escalating desperation in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The rustic home Heemskerk Jr shares with his wife, the De Volkskrant newspaper executive Corinne van Duin, is half an hour’s drive from Amsterdam in the village of Nederhorst den Berg and is a far cry from the Playboy Mansion. This being Dutch farmland, the water feature I must navigate is a bucolic dyke rather than a lagoon pool. In fact, the only clue to Heemskerk’s former life is a bunny-emblazoned security pass lanyard that now dangles from the charge card for the family’s small electric Fiat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;These days, Heemskerk — who has three grown-up sons of his own — is an ambassador not for Playboy but for a certain defiant approach to having Parkinson’s disease, for which he has written a book: &lt;i&gt;Parkinson’s for Beginners&lt;/i&gt;. Its millennial pink cover shows a caricature of Heemskerk flipping the bird, his middle finger vibrating with the involuntary “shakes” that are the best-known manifestation of the disease. Heemskerk describes his approach as “on the offensive”. It wasn’t always this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/crystal-hefner-the-playboy-mansion-was-riddled-with-black-mould-6hthpsltr" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crystal Hefner: ‘The Playboy Mansion was riddled with black mould’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nine years into a post-Playboy portfolio career that included founding a short-lived crowdfunding platform for glamour photography, Heemskerk was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2021 after multiple people — a producer on a daytime TV show, his parents — noticed him staring into space or dragging his feet. He duly went to see his GP who, concerned by Heemskerk’s performance in a balance exercise, referred him to a neurologist in Hilversum, the town 15 minutes away that is the epicentre of the Netherlands’s media industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In “Hillywood” the Parkinson’s diagnosis came instantaneously, after which a shocked Heemskerk resolved to hunker down and exist in ignorance. It seemed to him uniquely unfair that he should be saddled with a degenerative disease after having cleaned his act up so comprehensively. Since leaving Playboy he had renounced his former routine of “parties that go on deep into the night, lots of red meat and alcohol” in a body-and-soul makeover chronicled via two self-help books published under the umbrella title &lt;i&gt;Als Jan het kan&lt;/i&gt; … (&lt;i&gt;If Jan Can Do It …&lt;/i&gt;). For the first book he reformed his diet, renounced booze and shed nearly four stone after Van Duin made disparaging remarks about his waistline. For the second he investigated meditation and other wellness practices in an attempt to cure the insomnia that had dogged him for years — something he now suspects may have been an early sign of Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Affronted by the diagnosis, he delegated all reading on the subject of Parkinson’s to Van Duin, who was instructed only to relay the “good” news — of which there seemed precious little. Then, after almost two years with his head in the sand, Heemskerk decided it was time to face up to the matter at hand. &lt;i&gt;Parkinson’s for Beginners &lt;/i&gt;is his attempt to make up for lost time and — in keeping with his new role as spokesperson for the Parkinson’s charity Parkinson NL — spread awareness about what is now the fastest-growing neurological condition in the world, affecting between seven and ten million people globally, with estimates predicting a doubling of cases by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="2.14"&gt;&lt;div id="befed110-3033-4e11-91ac-14db7b519971"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Jan Heemskerk Sr in 1977&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;On a cellular level the disease is caused by the abnormal accumulation of a protein that prompts the death of nerve cells in a metabolically active part of the brain called the substantia nigra. This leads to a deficit in dopamine, a chemical that plays an important part in controlling movement and maintaining posture. Everything from memory and sight to swallowing and speech can be affected, and the standard treatment remains Levodopa, a dopamine replacement agent in use since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;While there is a small hereditary component — if a first-degree relative has Parkinson’s, you have a 2.4 per cent chance of developing it, as opposed to 0.8 per cent otherwise — the biggest culprits by far, Heemskerk says, are likely to be environmental. Parkinson’s is emphatically a disease of industrialised nations, with pesticides likely playing a role. As with the wine-growing regions of France, residents of the celebrated Bollenstreek — the bulb-growing swathe of the Netherlands with vividly striped tulip fields that draw millions of visitors — have an elevated incidence of Parkinson’s, with farmers and gardeners as a group 2 to 2.5 times more likely to get the disease, according to Professor Bas Bloem of Radboud University in Nijmegen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/healthcare/article/parkinsons-disease-symptoms-creativity-h9vz9sfmc" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parkinson’s and me: on good days I convince myself that life is as it was&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Luckily, the Netherlands punches above its weight when it comes to Parkinson’s research. Leiden University Medical Centre is using the Netherlands Donor Faeces Bank to investigate whether faecal transplants can help slow the progression of Parkinson’s. And this year Amsterdam University Medical Centre (UMC) will launch Plants for Parkinson’s, a programme to investigate whether the positive impact of plant-based nutrition — which the hospital found could be just as effective as painkillers and anti-inflammatories in alleviating symptoms for patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis — extends to Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Keen to get ahead of the game, Heemskerk switched to a vegan diet in the course of writing this book and enlisted the Amsterdam Nutritional Assessment Center and a UMC-affiliated dietician to monitor his progress over several months. The results, detailed in the book, are encouraging, with Heemskerk showing marked improvement across metrics including hand-grip strength (an indication of overall muscle function) and a timed chair stand, which determines balance and risk of falling. The hardened carnivore party animal is now, by his own admission, “an advanced vegan”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Resplendent in charcoal grey athleisurewear, Heemskerk says he now feels overwhelmingly grateful for the midlife health kick that stood him in such good stead for his diagnosis. His beloved golf may no longer be viable (“I kept losing the ball”) but he has stuck with his Fit20 brand of high-intensity strength training and — a reformed dog-hater — delights in taking the family labradoodle, Pippa, for 10km walks. He has found solace in membership of a sea-shanty choir. But he’s not peddling &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/books/article/salt-path-scandal-how-it-happened-raynor-winn-wn0rb7w5n" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Salt Path&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-style miracles. In the book, he describes crying in frustration and admits that life with Parkinson’s can be tough: “I am borderline deaf, blind as a bat, always losing everything and never know what day of the week it is.” Today is the hottest day of the year and he’s clearly finding speech very difficult — with Van Duin stepping in to interpret when his stammer becomes too muddy for me to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;He is at his most animated when I ask about the causes of Parkinson’s and what he considers our collective complacency with regard to industrialised agriculture. In September 2023, for example, the European Food Safety Authority granted a ten-year extension for the use of glyphosate, one of the most controversial herbicides when it comes to Parkinson’s. “Sometimes I feel like I should be out there telling people that they are in grave danger,” he says, gesturing towards the tidy, silent farmland all around us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;When he does venture out, the man who was once the Netherlands’ foremost authority on how to make it in the “glamour industry” is waggish about how times have changed.

By analyzing brain scans from young adults, researchers found that individuals with higher levels of psychopathic traits showed distinctive patterns of structural connections in the brain. These patterns, in turn, were associated with behaviors that involve acting out, suggesting that the brain’s wiring might help explain some of the behavioral tendencies linked to psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychopathy is often associated with impulsivity, aggression, and antisocial behavior. While past studies have focused heavily on how different brain regions function in people with psychopathic traits, less is known about how these regions are structurally connected. Structural connectivity refers to the physical links between brain areas—similar to the brain’s wiring system. The researchers aimed to go beyond earlier work that focused only on specific brain circuits and instead look across the entire brain to identify any structural patterns linked to psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were especially interested in understanding whether structural differences in the brain might explain the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. Previous models have suggested two possible brain-based explanations for these behaviors. One theory emphasizes problems in how people process emotional threats, while another highlights difficulties in attention control. Both theories have some support, but no study had comprehensively examined how structural brain networks might connect psychopathy with real-world behavioral problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team analyzed data from 82 young adults who participated in the Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body study. All participants were screened to rule out medical or psychological conditions that might affect the results. Psychopathic traits were assessed using a questionnaire designed to capture both interpersonal-affective characteristics (like manipulation and lack of empathy) and behavioral traits (like impulsivity and rule-breaking). Externalizing behaviors were also measured with a separate questionnaire that included items on aggression, defiance, and similar tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant underwent high-resolution brain imaging using diffusion MRI, a technique that maps the white matter tracts—essentially the brain’s wiring—connecting different regions. The researchers used a method called connectome-based predictive modeling, which relies on machine learning to identify patterns in the brain’s structural connectivity that relate to individual differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method allowed them to identify two kinds of networks: positive networks, where stronger connections were linked to higher psychopathy scores, and negative networks, where weaker connections were related to those same scores. They also tested whether specific connections within these networks helped explain the relationship between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that psychopathic traits were significantly associated with both stronger and weaker connections in different parts of the brain. The positive network—made up of connections that increased with psychopathy—was better at predicting psychopathic traits than the negative network alone. But when both networks were combined, the prediction became even more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the connections in the positive network were located within the brain’s frontal and parietal lobes, which are involved in decision-making, emotional processing, and attention. These connections included pathways like the uncinate fasciculus, which links the frontal cortex with areas involved in emotion, and the arcuate fasciculus, which supports language and auditory processing. Other connections involved the cingulum bundle, associated with emotional regulation and social behavior, and the posterior corticostriatal pathway, which plays a role in reward processing and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the negative network involved fewer connections, notably in regions like the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus on the left side of the brain. These tracts are important for attention control and integrating information across different senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at whether specific connections in these networks could explain the link between psychopathic traits and externalizing behaviors. They found that one connection in the right hemisphere—part of a tract involved in emotion recognition—was associated with both psychopathy and higher levels of externalizing behavior. A second connection in the left hemisphere—related to attention control—was linked to both psychopathy and lower levels of these behaviors. Mediation analyses suggested that these two connections acted as pathways through which psychopathic traits might influence externalizing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that structural differences in how the brain is connected may play a role in how psychopathic traits are expressed behaviorally. Some connections—especially those involved in emotion and reward processing—may contribute to difficulties in recognizing and responding to social and emotional cues, which could make aggressive or impulsive behaviors more likely. Other connections, especially those related to attention control, may affect a person’s ability to process competing information, potentially influencing how they respond in complex or emotionally charged situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found that people with higher psychopathic traits did not always show weaker brain connections. In fact, some brain networks showed increased connectivity. This is different from earlier findings that have mostly focused on reduced structural integrity in white matter. The current study used a different measurement—counting the number of streamlines between regions—which may capture broader patterns of connection rather than subtle changes in tissue structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also emphasized that the results support a dual-pathway model of psychopathy. One pathway involves problems with emotional processing, and the other involves attention control. These two types of brain circuits may work independently or together to influence how psychopathic traits are expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer new insight into the brain’s role in psychopathy, there are several limitations. The participants in the study were young adults from the general population, and most had relatively low levels of externalizing behaviors. This limits how much the results can be applied to people with more severe or clinical forms of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also did not include behavioral or cognitive tasks that could directly link the brain’s structural features to performance in real-world situations. Including such tasks in future studies could help clarify how these brain differences translate into specific deficits in emotional or attentional processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study treated psychopathy as a single dimension. But research suggests that different components of psychopathy—such as callousness versus impulsivity—may be linked to different brain circuits. Future studies could look at how structural connectivity relates to specific traits or subtypes of psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the study’s sample size was relatively small, and the findings need to be replicated in larger and more diverse populations, including those with higher levels of psychopathic traits or histories of criminal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.70158" target="_blank"&gt;The Role of Structural Brain Networks in Psychopathy and Its Relation to Externalizing Behaviors&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Peiyang Guo, Cheng Cheng, and Xiangyi Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 20:20:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOa1RmT1dUN0xmWnpMalFZTU9vV3ZyMHA0UW9tTG12Y3lZWjU1blJBQW52S1diWnd3QVBFcG9VWmNmZG82dU1PZ0RzX0V1NXlfVTBTSG1Fa2s4bDUtWWE1VUhVeTRTVEZsYjFBSUN6SEJoVE10SFBvQmVQNkRSLWJ0dVI4UnNPbDNNQXpTd29fOWU4NHJ4anpHWVlZMWRJOUtabmkwWFBkRkEwbzQ</guid></item><item><title>据营养师介绍，最佳减肥高蛋白午餐- EatingWell | The Best High-Protein Lunch for Weight Loss, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNYzV4UUxhaU5ZaXFXaExaeVAwSlJaeXQ0cXdvWkVKVGNaZC1hU2p2QUJWcWpXdGVzcVRzSFVRWjVXaHpKcU5CTVR4eXBhTnZseGpBVjg4cHpPZHlhVy1xOXNtV2VaYkp0dFh6T1hpSmpDa1dHVXQyVk1ka3lSUmM1Tg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There may come a time in your life or that of a loved one where weight loss becomes a goal. It might have nothing to do with vanity, either. The emotional and physical toll of daily life can affect our health and weight. Whether it’s overeating as a way to cope with the loss of a job, or bingeing on junk food to manage the stress of taking care of family, we often turn to food for comfort. Luckily, there are strategies that can help you manage both your weight and your overall health. One of the best weight-loss strategies is choosing to enjoy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7833555/top-nutrients-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meals rich in nutrients&lt;/a&gt; that provide energy and promote satiety. One of my favorite lunch recipes that leans into that strategy is this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-chicken-salad-sandwich-11687670" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s why I think it’s the best lunch for weight loss.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One reason I love this lunch is that it’s packed with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;. It provides more than 40 grams of protein per sandwich, thanks to the chicken and Greek yogurt. But why is protein so important for weight loss? &lt;a href="https://www.christywilsonnutrition.com/menu" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christy Wilson, RDN&lt;/a&gt;, says, “When it comes to weight loss, protein helps keep us feeling full and satisfied long after we’ve eaten.”  Wilson cites a recent study where participants did lose weight when protein was 16% to 45% of total calories consumed. High-protein diets appeared to increase satiety and energy expenditure while improving body composition by increasing the amount of fat-free mass.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Ultra-Satisfying &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The protein makes the meal satisfying, but so does how it’s packaged. The chicken salad, for starters, is made with flavorful ingredients like tangy Greek yogurt and slightly sweet sun-dried tomatoes. There’s also the arugula, which adds color and a bright, peppery bite. Finally, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8045858/whole-grain-bread-vs-whole-wheat-bread/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole-wheat bread provides texture&lt;/a&gt; as well as a variety of nutrients, including fiber, which benefits health and boosts satiety. Each bite is as delicious and satisfying as the next!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Be Enjoyed in a Variety of Ways &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I love meals that can be reinterpreted or modified for enjoyment in other ways. This chicken salad sandwich is one of those meals. For example, during the warmer summer months, I prefer to serve the chicken salad over lettuce and include other seasonal vegetables as part of the meal. In the fall and winter, I’ll enjoy it as a sandwich but swap the bread for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sourdough-or-whole-wheat-bread-better-for-gut-health-11771656" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sourdough or something whole-grain and hearty&lt;/a&gt; from my local bakery. Or I’ll stuff the chicken salad into a bell pepper and broil for a few minutes to enjoy it warm. Being able to reinvent the dish means I can enjoy it several ways without getting bored!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s important to consider the food you eat when it comes to weight loss, but there are other things you can do, even during lunchtime, to help. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy your lunch with co-workers:&lt;/strong&gt; Eating by yourself or sitting at your desk staring at a screen is fine occasionally, but if you have the opportunity, I suggest &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8025502/cooking-and-eating-together-impact-your-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;dining with co-workers&lt;/a&gt;. Sitting down and talking with people during your meal gives you an excuse to slow down and enjoy your food while enjoying the company of others. This is good for digestion as well as boosting your mood—both of which can help with weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take a walk:&lt;/strong&gt; Either before or after your lunch, consider going on a walk. The benefits of movement go beyond weight loss, as research has proven &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;exercise makes you feel good&lt;/a&gt; and gives you energy. If a walk isn’t an option, consider finding some stairs to conquer, or just take a few laps around the office or your home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sip water:&lt;/strong&gt; Hydration plays a powerful role in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/does-drinking-water-help-you-lose-weight-11725115" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because the opposite, dehydration, can trick your mind into thinking you’re hungry versus thirsty. Good hydration means you’ll feel better too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a mindful reset: &lt;/strong&gt;Use your lunch break as a time to hit the mental “reset” button. Use a wellness app to find a quick mediation to help you relax or do some deep-breathing exercises to clear your mind. Taking a moment to center yourself can also &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290947/mindful-eating-the-key-to-eating-what-you-want-and-fully-enjoying-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;prevent mindless eating&lt;/a&gt; or overeating and help you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-habit-to-lose-weight-11766982" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;listen to your body’s cues for hunger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893676/how-to-lose-weight-when-you-dont-know-where-to-start-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;strategies you can use when looking to lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. A great one is enjoying a lunch that’s delicious and satisfying. Choosing something high in protein that includes a variety of ingredients and textures is a great option, like my favorite Marry Me Chicken Salad Sandwich. But remember, it’s not the only way. Be sure to include movement and socialization time in your plan. Stay hydrated and carve out some time for a midday reset. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And remember, says &lt;a href="https://www.resetlifestyle.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Wintana Kiros, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;: While protein is the foundation that helps you feel full, preserves your muscle and keeps you strong during weight loss, you also need fiber-rich carbs, healthy fats and anti-inflammatory foods like colorful plants to bring balance. So don’t exclude these other foods, she says. “Think of protein as your anchor, not your entire ship.”&lt;br&gt;

By recording brain activity in epilepsy patients watching a TV episode, they found ripples marked event boundaries in the hippocampus while supporting information processing in cortical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This segmentation acts like punctuation, helping organize experiences into coherent episodes.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is led by Lluís Fuentemilla, a researcher at the IDIBELL and UBneuro Cognition and Brain Plasticity research group, and is part of the doctoral thesis carried out in this same group by Marta Silva, the article’s first author, who is currently at Columbia University (United States). Experts from the Epilepsy Unit at Hospital Clínic de Barcelona – August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Columbia University, Ruhr University Bochum and Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (Germany) also participated in the study.&lt;br&gt;​​​​​​​&lt;br&gt;The recollection of specific episodes is the basis of memory. Although experience is constant, there is evidence that the brain segments it when there are changes in the flow of information to convert it into memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These segments mark the point at which the brain closes one episode in memory and begins recording another. For example, when you are doing something and you receive a phone call or the doorbell rings, the brain identifies that there has been a change in the course of the experience and uses these events as if they were punctuation marks, a full stop in a sentence, to proceed to store what you were doing in the form of an episode”, says Lluís Fuentemilla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Previous studies in mice have indicated that ripples play a fundamental role in memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These waves are thought to coordinate information transfer between the hippocampus and neocortical regions — the temporal and frontal cortex — helping to integrate new memories. This neural signal is key to generating synaptic potentiation, allowing the brain to fix and consolidate a memory”, note the researchers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A pioneering experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although these signals have been extensively studied in animals, especially mice, their analysis in humans has been very limited. This is due to the difficulty of recording them, as they originate in brain areas that require the use of intracranial electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, however, researchers have managed to analyse these waves in a naturalistic context, i.e. in conditions close to everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, they recorded the intracranial electrophysiological activity of ten patients with epilepsy — who had undergone surgery for clinical reasons — while they watched the first episode of the BBC series&lt;em&gt; Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;, which lasts 50 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This type of narrative format, as in real life, features scene changes that the brain identifies as event boundaries. The participants were then asked to recall and recount what they remembered of the plot”, the authors explain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results showed a dynamic pattern of ripple wave activation during memory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that these waves occurred in both the hippocampus and neocortical areas. However, they followed a different temporal rhythm: in the hippocampus, ripple activity increased at the boundaries of events, reflecting their role in segmentation; in contrast, in cortical regions, their presence was higher during the internal development of events”, says Marta Silva.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;​​​​​​​According to the researchers, this pattern suggests coordination between the two brain structures, as if they were “an orchestra”: the neocortical regions actively process information, and the hippocampus kicks in when there is a change of scene to “pack and consolidate” the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Segmenting to remember&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These findings reinforce the idea of the importance of segmentation and structuring in memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we see, both in this study and in related work, is that it is not enough to pay attention and record information, but that it is equally or more important to organize it in the context of the constant flow of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, it is not just a matter of activating the brain’s machinery while it is recording information, but also of acting as an orchestra conductor who marks when the memory begins and ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These signals help not only to record what is happening as it happens, but also to organize the information coherently”, they point out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results could also have important implications for understanding memory disorders and developing future therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To date, when faced with an amnesic problem, we thought of attention deficits or difficulties in acquiring information. Our results suggest that there could also be a failure in these segmentation signals, in how information is structured in the brain”, they note.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this sense, the study opens the door to exploring therapies that consider how information is organized at the brain level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In older people, for example, who are beginning to show memory impairment, it could be beneficial to present information in a more structured way, with clear pauses between relevant events. Not only as a matter of cognitive rhythm, but because this could facilitate its correct encoding and storage”, they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#dba9b4a8bab6baa9afb2b5bea19baeb9f5bebfae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rosa Martínez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ub.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Barcelona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rosa Martínez – University of Barcelona&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-60788-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;A naturalistic study reveals ripples in the human temporal cortex track episodic memory formation&lt;/a&gt;” by Lluís Fuentemilla et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A naturalistic study reveals ripples in the human temporal cortex track episodic memory formation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripples are fast oscillatory events widely recognized as crucial markers for memory consolidation and neural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These transient bursts of activity are thought to coordinate information transfer between the hippocampus and neocortical areas, providing a temporal framework that supports the stabilization and integration of new memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, their role in human memory encoding during naturalistic scenarios remains unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we recorded intracranial electrophysiological data from ten epilepsy patients watching a movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ripples were analyzed in the hippocampus and neocortical regions (i.e., temporal and frontal cortex).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results revealed a differential dynamical pattern of ripple occurrence during encoding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enhanced hippocampal ripple recruitment was observed at event boundaries, reflecting hippocampal involvement in event segmentation, whereas higher ripple rates were seen within an event for cortical electrodes with higher ripple occurrence at the temporal cortex, reflecting whether an event was later recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying memory encoding and provide insights into the potential role of ripples in the encoding of an event, suggesting an impact on the formation of long-term memories of distinct episodes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 18:53:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1yMlZYVlhBV0V4QmhpcDA5YURHLWVMbUQwNWFKTXp5SHBHd1NXX3lGTGY4TXJYR0dnZmhRbjFOQmo3T2xuNWFzZElyMkp2U1ozSTBXeURiR1NXODlTZjM3R1BaQ21DMEpKa0V0Rw</guid></item><item><title>压力声音如何放大疼痛和炎症-神经科学新闻 | How Stress Sounds Amplify Pain and Inflammation - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY0FVX3lxTE9WY0hncHBLcFZhM3ZseTh6LWdZb2VEQTR3MnZEbnNDS0NGWkpQWUMtbWl2MktYNU9iY3VaenVCc2RLM0dWeDRuYWxqYmx4eWF2S3R6c25vQ1Y5SHVkYy1zSXpmVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Pain isn’t just physical—it can be socially and emotionally transmitted. New research shows that ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by mice in pain trigger hyperalgesia in nearby mice, even without direct injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “sound stress” response involves brain inflammation, gene activation, and heightened pain sensitivity, which can also worsen existing pain and blunt treatment effects.

While physical pain is an outcome of tissue damage, pain can manifest as diverse unpleasant sensory and emotional experiences. Many studies report that emotional or psychological stress enhances pain responses. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, mice housed with other mice experiencing inflammatory pain exhibit a ‘bystander effect’ with heightened pain sensitivity, or ‘hyperalgesia.’ However, the effects that underpin social pain transmission remain elusive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111791"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman holding her head in pain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/stress-sound-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Notably, exposure to sound stress led to hyperalgesia, measured by a decrease in the paw withdrawal threshold. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodents emit ultrasonic vocalizations in the form of high-pitched squeaks in response to various stimuli, including pain, in both audible and ultrasound frequencies that are inaudible to humans. Recently, a team of researchers led by Assistant Professor Satoka Kasai from the Department of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Science (TUS), Japan, conducted a series of experiments to understand how ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by mice in response to pain stimuli affect the other mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLOS One,&lt;/em&gt; was co-authored by Professor Satoru Miyazaki, Professor Akiyoshi Saitoh, (the late) Professor Satoshi Iriyama, and Professor Kazumi Yoshizawa, all from TUS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giving further insight into their exciting findings, Asst. Prof. Kasai explains, “In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by mice in response to pain stimuli induce emotional transmission and hyperalgesia in other mice. These mice exhibit hypersensitivity that arises without injury or direct painful stimulation but is instead triggered by exposure to sound stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recorded and extracted the ultrasonic range from stress calls emitted by mice experiencing pain and exposed naïve mice to the sound stress in a soundproof box in the absence of other external stressors or stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, they evaluated the mechanical/tactile sensitivity of mice by using von Frey filaments of different stiffness to gauge the threshold that elicits the animals’ hind paw withdrawal. Notably, exposure to sound stress led to hyperalgesia, measured by a decrease in the paw withdrawal threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying sound stress-induced hyperalgesia, the researchers performed a microarray analysis, a technique used to assess gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that sound stress exposure led to the upregulation of 444 genes (particularly &lt;em&gt;prostaglandin-endoperoxidase synthase 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1&lt;/em&gt;) and downregulation of 231 genes in the brain tissue compared to control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, functional and molecular pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were related to inflammatory and lipopolysaccharide response and the tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, suggesting their potential role in sound stress-induced hyperalgesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatment with anti-inflammatory (pain-relieving) agents following exposure to sound stress significantly suppressed pain responses. Additionally, exposure to sound stress prolonged pain in a mouse model of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents attenuated pain responses exacerbated by sound stress in mice with heightened inflammation, thus corroborating the demonstrated association between sound stress, inflammation, and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings shed light on how sound stress can induce hyperalgesia and exacerbate inflammation and pain responses. In the current study, mice were exposed solely to sound stress in the absence of other sensory stimuli such as sight, smell, or contact, suggesting that social pain transfer can occur through sound exposure alone.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results highlight the impact of social or environmental factors on chronic pain or stress-related pain persistence. Additional studies are needed to understand how different sounds that reflect different mental or emotional states influence pain responses in different regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, these findings highlight the importance of medical environments free from stressful sounds that can induce brain inflammation and worsen pain or recovery. Additionally, the study paves the way for the exploration of ultrasound-induced neuroinflammatory mechanisms involved in pain perception and pain modulation using ultrasonic exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asst. Prof. Kasai concludes by saying, “In addition to inducing inflammation in the brain that leads to hyperalgesia, sound stress also exacerbates inflammatory pain and may interfere with pain-relieving treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research can help improve the understanding of stress-related pain and guide the development of new, scientifically based pain management treatment strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these findings provide novel insights into mental health, pain perception, and emotional empathy, explaining why some individuals feel more pain on seeing or hearing others in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The authors received a grant from FUJIMIC Inc.

However, the specific mechanisms behind emotional transmission are still not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, sounds in the ultrasonic domain that were recorded during pain stimulation in mice were used as sound stress to examine the effects of psychological stress caused by exposure to ultrasound on tactile thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also examined the effects of psychological stress caused by the ultrasound on an inflammatory pain model of mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tactile threshold decreased the next and three days after sound stress exposure in mice. DNA microarray analysis of the mouse thalamus exposed to sound stress revealed increased expression of inflammation-related genes, &lt;em&gt;Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 1&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their respective inhibitors, loxoprofen and SB225002, significantly improved hyperalgesia induced by sound stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sound stress was applied to a mouse model of inflammatory pain in which pain thresholds were restored 14 days after complete Freund’s adjuvant administration, prolonged pain and attenuated analgesic effects of loxoprofen were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that sound stress not only induces inflammation in the brain that causes hyperalgesia but may also be partially responsible for exacerbating inflammatory pain, hence complicating treatment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 18:34:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTE9WY0hncHBLcFZhM3ZseTh6LWdZb2VEQTR3MnZEbnNDS0NGWkpQWUMtbWl2MktYNU9iY3VaenVCc2RLM0dWeDRuYWxqYmx4eWF2S3R6c25vQ1Y5SHVkYy1zSXpmVQ</guid></item><item><title>波尔克县发生车祸，车辆翻转，淹没在水中； 5人受伤- KCCI | Vehicle flips, submerges in water in Polk County crash; five injured - KCCI</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxQSW10ZVJ3RFRLb0ZGSDRaNjlWUVJYUlR1Q3BybmJ1cHkxMTE1YnQxNzliRjg0YUFYV0xXMXp2VFFndnJHMms3RjBsbmlpVXNJc3haUnlxVmllRHdlZ1VPRUl5emptb3c5MkhlTElsOFl2YlcyUTYzRFFRV1RHbkxRT19xaU01RUNiTzA4SzlxRmdOaEZKZG40UHM2OFlLTXRibmhsRThjWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;

Unless AMR programmes are protected from aid cuts, resistance rates across the world will likely increase at a rate in line with the worst-affected countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This would result in millions more people dying worldwide, including across G7 nations. Investing in treatment for bacterial infections now will save lives and deliver billions in long-term economic returns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The research calculated the economic and health burden of antibiotic resistance for 122 countries and forecast that in that in this most pessimistic scenario, by 2050, GDP losses in China could reach just under $722bn a year, the US $295.7bn, the EU $187bn, Japan $65.7bn and the UK $58.6bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation&lt;/a&gt; (IHME), deaths from AMR are expected to increase 60% by 2050, with 1.34 million people in the US and 184,000 in the UK alone predicted to die each year from antibiotic resistant bugs, while numbers of those becoming seriously ill from drug-resistant bacteria are also expected to jump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Superbugs increase the number of hospital admissions and lead to longer and more intensive hospital stays, costlier second-line treatments and more complex care, meaning resistant infections are roughly twice as expensive to treat as those for which antibiotics are effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study estimates global health costs of treating AMR could increase by just under $176bn a year, while in the UK, they would rise from $900m to $3.7bn and in the US from $15.5bn to just under $57bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Higher rates of resistant bugs would also shrink the UK, EU and US workforces by 0.8%, 0.6% and 0.4% respectively, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But if countries invest more in tackling superbugs – increasing access to new antibiotics and high-quality treatment of these infections – the US economy would grow $156.2bn a year and the UK $12bn (£9.3bn) by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Responding to the findings, Dr Mohsen Naghavi, a professor of health metrics at IHME, said: “Today the threat of AMR is increasing, and without immediate action from all stakeholders the medicines we have access to now could stop working, potentially causing a simple infection to become deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That would involve policy changes from the US, European and UK governments, the development of new drugs and ensuring everyone understood that antibiotics were ineffective against viruses, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A UK government spokesperson said: “Our 10-year health plan recognises antimicrobial resistance (AMR) as a major threat and commits to urgently tackle its spread, including through new vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have made important progress - reducing antibiotic use in meat and pioneering a world-first subscription model to incentivise the development of new treatments. We also continue to work closely with international partners to influence global efforts to limit the spread of AMR.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxPcnlkbm41dnZxbVA4ZjhfRnk0c3U0b0NTbE4zTUk2VmhYQTRjWFl3QUVpX1I4WHlCS2VYNkhWN2Nrd0VKMkZWS1lPVjdnVEFJRFhua25VbGNXVEg2N2xrZEo2Sl9RWWxGajNqbmZlQnkwUkEtLUFkbVRlLU5nSWl3YkhXTHhNSnctNTlUOHl2aEIyYzlKMEVoalgxWWsyWmVBUGJCemtkN0hEZlNyRVdkalkteV91WURncThPM2g4VQ</guid></item><item><title>并非所有的人造甜味剂都对您有害，这也可能对抗癌症- Earth.com | Not all artificial sweeteners are bad for you, and this one might also fight cancer - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxPcC0wSkFyNno4TGlyXzFOZHJqWUkzWVR5VFM2WHNTZ1JZdDVDbVNONkFuVGZfaUticFk3ZHZUMGxEVlpjVzktOElDdWNzd0NuSWZEdVhxRUp0VUtHMnpXcC01Z0Y1bWpIaGppVjZlVUdLR1NjcU5YZEpLSUNfU2dVRlFqM0YxSTRDZmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stevia may soon offer more than just sweetness. In the lab, researchers found that when fermented with a bacterium from banana leaves, this natural plant extract targets pancreatic cancer cells – while leaving healthy kidney cells unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Globally, the incidence and mortality rates of pancreatic cancer continue to rise, with a five-year survival rate of less than 10%,” said study co-author Narandalai Danshiitsoodol from &lt;a href="https://www.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hiroshima University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pancreatic cancer is highly invasive and prone to metastasis, showing significant resistance to existing treatments, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. As such, there is an urgent need to identify new and effective anticancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-cells-create-power-waves-to-fuel-invasion/"&gt;compounds&lt;/a&gt;, particularly those derived from medicinal plants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fermented-stevia-for-cancer-therapy"&gt;Fermented stevia for cancer therapy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; SN13T, a bacterium from banana leaves. They fermented stevia leaves and compared the result to a regular extract. The fermented version (FSLE) worked better in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To enhance the pharmacological efficacy of natural plant extracts, microbial biotransformation has emerged as an effective strategy,” said Masanori Sugiyama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we aimed to compare LAB-fermented and non-fermented extracts to identify key compounds that enhance bioactivity, ultimately contributing to the efficacy of herbal medicine in cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/walking-each-day-at-any-speed-lowers-the-risk-of-cancer/"&gt;prevention&lt;/a&gt; and therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t just mix things and hope. They optimized fermentation time, temperature, and oxygen levels. Stevia turned out to be most potent when fermented for 72 hours, without oxygen, at 37°C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fermented-stevia-hits-cancer-cells-hard"&gt;Fermented stevia hits cancer cells hard&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented stevia killed pancreatic cancer (PANC-1) cells more efficiently than the non-fermented extract. At the same time, it barely touched healthy HEK-293 cells, even at high doses. That balance is rare and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some concentrations, FSLE didn’t kill cancer cells immediately. Instead, it slowed their growth. The cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-scientist-discovers-that-common-non-cancer-drugs-when-combined-can-kill-cancer-cells/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; looked weak, lost shape, and stopped sticking together. Under the microscope, they looked scattered and unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy kidney cells stayed mostly unaffected. This points to selectivity – a key feature for safe treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-strong-antioxidant-effects"&gt;Strong antioxidant effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer isn’t just about rogue cells. Oxidative stress plays a big role. Fermented stevia turned out to be a powerful antioxidant too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In lab tests, it neutralized free radicals more effectively than non-fermented extract. It hit 94% scavenging power in the DPPH assay and 75% in ABTS. Even when healthy cells were exposed to hydrogen peroxide, FSLE helped them survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation likely created new compounds. The researchers suspect chlorogenic acid transformed into chlorogenic acid methyl ester (CAME), a more active form. Fermented stevia contained lots of it. The raw extract had none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-powerful-compound-fights-cancer-cells"&gt;Powerful compound fights cancer cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;CAME packed more punch than chlorogenic acid. It stopped cancer cell growth and triggered their self-destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its IC50 – the dose that kills half the cancer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breakthrough-cancer-cells-have-a-molecular-switch-that-could-be-rewired-to-behave-normally/"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; – was just 119.1 µg/mL. For regular chlorogenic acid, it was 189.6 µg/mL. That’s a big difference. CAME shut down cancer cells by blocking their cell cycle and making them commit apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flow cytometry showed CAME, produced by fermented stevia, locked the cells in the G0/G1 phase. That’s the stage before a cell starts duplicating. It also caused the cells to release cytochrome c and activate caspases, which break down dying cells from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-altered-gene-activity"&gt;Altered gene activity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the gene level, things got interesting. CAME dialed up pro-apoptotic genes like Bax, Bad, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Cytochrome c. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound also boosted E-cadherin, a gene linked to reduced cancer migration. Meanwhile, it shut down Bcl-2, a gene that normally stops cells from dying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gene activity supports what the microscope and assays showed. The cells didn’t just die randomly. CAME pushed them into a specific self-destruct mode, the mitochondrial pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stevia-more-than-just-a-sweetener"&gt;Stevia: More than just a sweetener&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermentation changed the story. It gave stevia extract a new weapon – a compound that targets &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/light-activated-molecules-kill-cancer-cells-with-precision/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; while keeping healthy cells safe. That transformation seems to happen through specific enzymes from the SN13T strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This microbial transformation was likely due to specific enzymes in the bacteria strain used,” Danshiitsoodol said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our data demonstrate that CAME exhibits stronger toxicity to cells and pro-apoptotic effects – which encourage cell death – on PANC-1 cells compared to chlorogenic acid alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-upcoming-cancer-research-with-stevia"&gt;Upcoming cancer research with stevia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team plans to move beyond the lab dish. Mouse studies come next. That will show whether fermented stevia works in living systems with real immune responses and complex metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The present study has substantially enhanced our understanding of the mechanism of action of the Lactobacillus plantarum SN13T strain in the fermentation of herbal extracts, while also offering a valuable research perspective on the potential application of probiotics as natural anti-tumor agents,” said Danshiitsoodol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research suggests that with the right microbes, even a simple leaf can evolve into a targeted therapy. Not bad for a sugar substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/26/9/4186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;International Journal of Molecular Sciences&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

But lurking beneath all these headlines and gripes lies a stubborn, unshakable fact: in 2025, Americans simply don’t live as long as citizens in dozens of other high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re an average American baby born this year, you’re expected to live about 78 years. That sounds fine, maybe even good to some ears, but step outside US borders even just over to Canada or across the United Kingdom and it’s abundantly clear: Americans are living shorter lives than almost all their economic peers and, frankly, than millions of people in less wealthy parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s going on? Let’s take a look into what the latest data tells us about American longevity—and why, for all the tech innovations and world-class medical centers dotting the landscape, life expectancy here just keeps stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does &lt;keyword id="3932708" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="US-life-expectancy" source="Orion"&gt;US life expectancy&lt;/keyword&gt; measure up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first: life expectancy is the average number of years a newborn can expect to live under current mortality rates. In the US, that number hit a recent low after COVID-19 but has since bounced back a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s not keeping pace with history—or with the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023 US life expectancy: 78.4 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global Average (2025): 73.5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ranking: 48th globally (and slipping)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: the US is above the global average, but a few years below its “peer” nations. Most of Western Europe, plus Japan, Australia, South Korea, and even some smaller nations like Monaco, enjoy life expectancies between 82 and 87 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are on average living about 3–5 years less than their economic peers, and as much as 8 years less than the world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the numbers really say&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the latest stats for the US:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both sexes: 78.4 years (2023 data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Males: 75.8 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Females: 81.1 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Canada, France, Japan, and even the UK all clock in well above the US average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO (World Health Organization) data lines up: no matter which authority you check, the trend is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;America’s rank in the longevity league&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that put the US? In 48th place (as per several reports) and, according to the latest forecasts by World Population Review, likely to drop even further down the list by 2050. Other wealthy nations, meanwhile, continue to inch higher, sometimes gaining years while the US just creeps forward months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer nations growing faster: For example, Japan, Korea, Portugal, the UK, and Italy already clock in at 80+ years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;US trend is stagnating: Some projections put the US at 80.4 years—in 2050. That’s nearly a quarter-century just to gain a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is the US lagging behind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spent any time in a US health economics classroom, you might echo this refrain: Americans spend more—way more—on healthcare than anyone else, but live shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get sticky (and let’s be real, infuriating). According to the CDC and public health research, several chronic and acute challenges conspire to keep US life expectancy low:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease and obesity: Rates here dwarf those in peer nations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes: A chronic and costly epidemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Diseases of despair": Suicide, alcoholism, and drug overdoses hit the US particularly hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant mortality: Above-average for a wealthy nation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicle fatalities: Still shockingly high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare disparity: Insurance rates, cost barriers, and uneven healthcare access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socioeconomic inequality: Health outcomes dramatically vary by income, ZIP code, and racial group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are living shorter, sicker lives even as the country outspends rivals on everything from advanced surgeries to high-end drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparing to the UK and peers: A stark gap&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause and zero in on a particularly telling comparison: the United States vs. the United Kingdom. Recent investigative reports by Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health deliver this sobering headline: Americans live years less than the Brits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading causes of excess US deaths: Heart disease, drug overdoses, infant and maternal deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really stands out isn’t just the small year-by-year difference. It’s the long-term trend: since the 1980s, America’s trajectory has flatlined, while Europe trudges upward—even through its own crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy differences: Universal coverage, safety nets, and regenerative social programs in the UK and Europe often make healthier choices easier and provide fallback care when disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health investment: The UK spends less on care, but more on prevention and community wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digging into health habits and policy differences&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for “silver bullet” explanations, the data won’t cut you any slack. It’s death by a thousand small problems, and they’re entangled:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet: Appallingly high processed food consumption, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ultra-processed snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise: Sedentary lifestyles prevail, especially among kids and teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addiction: A toxic brew of widespread opioid, meth, and alcohol abuse.

But lurking beneath all these headlines and gripes lies a stubborn, unshakable fact: in 2025, Americans simply don’t live as long as citizens in dozens of other high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re an average American baby born this year, you’re expected to live about 78 years. That sounds fine, maybe even good to some ears, but step outside US borders even just over to Canada or across the United Kingdom and it’s abundantly clear: Americans are living shorter lives than almost all their economic peers and, frankly, than millions of people in less wealthy parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what’s going on? Let’s take a look into what the latest data tells us about American longevity—and why, for all the tech innovations and world-class medical centers dotting the landscape, life expectancy here just keeps stagnating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does &lt;keyword id="3932708" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="US-life-expectancy" source="Orion"&gt;US life expectancy&lt;/keyword&gt; measure up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first: life expectancy is the average number of years a newborn can expect to live under current mortality rates. In the US, that number hit a recent low after COVID-19 but has since bounced back a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it’s not keeping pace with history—or with the rest of the developed world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2023 US life expectancy: 78.4 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global Average (2025): 73.5 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ranking: 48th globally (and slipping)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s the kicker: the US is above the global average, but a few years below its “peer” nations. Most of Western Europe, plus Japan, Australia, South Korea, and even some smaller nations like Monaco, enjoy life expectancies between 82 and 87 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are on average living about 3–5 years less than their economic peers, and as much as 8 years less than the world leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the numbers really say&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes the latest stats for the US:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Both sexes: 78.4 years (2023 data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Males: 75.8 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Females: 81.1 years&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, Canada, France, Japan, and even the UK all clock in well above the US average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO (World Health Organization) data lines up: no matter which authority you check, the trend is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;America’s rank in the longevity league&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where does that put the US? In 48th place (as per several reports) and, according to the latest forecasts by World Population Review, likely to drop even further down the list by 2050. Other wealthy nations, meanwhile, continue to inch higher, sometimes gaining years while the US just creeps forward months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peer nations growing faster: For example, Japan, Korea, Portugal, the UK, and Italy already clock in at 80+ years and counting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;US trend is stagnating: Some projections put the US at 80.4 years—in 2050. That’s nearly a quarter-century just to gain a single year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why is the US lagging behind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you spent any time in a US health economics classroom, you might echo this refrain: Americans spend more—way more—on healthcare than anyone else, but live shorter lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s where things get sticky (and let’s be real, infuriating). According to the CDC and public health research, several chronic and acute challenges conspire to keep US life expectancy low:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiovascular disease and obesity: Rates here dwarf those in peer nations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes: A chronic and costly epidemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Diseases of despair": Suicide, alcoholism, and drug overdoses hit the US particularly hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant mortality: Above-average for a wealthy nation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motor vehicle fatalities: Still shockingly high.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare disparity: Insurance rates, cost barriers, and uneven healthcare access.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Socioeconomic inequality: Health outcomes dramatically vary by income, ZIP code, and racial group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are living shorter, sicker lives even as the country outspends rivals on everything from advanced surgeries to high-end drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparing to the UK and peers: A stark gap&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s pause and zero in on a particularly telling comparison: the United States vs. the United Kingdom. Recent investigative reports by Johns Hopkins’ Bloomberg School of Public Health deliver this sobering headline: Americans live years less than the Brits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading causes of excess US deaths: Heart disease, drug overdoses, infant and maternal deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What really stands out isn’t just the small year-by-year difference. It’s the long-term trend: since the 1980s, America’s trajectory has flatlined, while Europe trudges upward—even through its own crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy differences: Universal coverage, safety nets, and regenerative social programs in the UK and Europe often make healthier choices easier and provide fallback care when disaster strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health investment: The UK spends less on care, but more on prevention and community wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digging into health habits and policy differences&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for “silver bullet” explanations, the data won’t cut you any slack. It’s death by a thousand small problems, and they’re entangled:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diet: Appallingly high processed food consumption, sugar-sweetened beverages, and ultra-processed snacks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise: Sedentary lifestyles prevail, especially among kids and teens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Addiction: A toxic brew of widespread opioid, meth, and alcohol abuse. Overdose rates have reached devastating levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental health: Underfunded and stigmatized, pushing more people into crisis and self-harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthcare Coverage: Insurance gaps, high out-of-pocket costs, and rural hospital closures remain endemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Environmental factors: Pockets of heavy pollution and “food deserts.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the CDC points out, even American children today face a 1-in-5 shot at developing obesity before adulthood, foreshadowing future medical costs and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What would it take for America to catch up?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts and studies converge on a short list of must-dos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle chronic disease: Expand access to preventive screening, healthy foods, and physical activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Address the opioid crisis: Investment in mental health and addiction treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make healthcare universal and affordable: Reduce insurance and cost barriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maternal and infant health: More prenatal care, family leave, and education.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tackle poverty and inequality: Social safety nets, fair wages, and safer housing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without bolder national action—and strong local follow-through—these gains will remain elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s health gap is no longer a technical problem; it’s a political, social, and moral one.

This can happen for several reasons. For example, some diabetes medications (like metformin) can interfere with nutrient absorption, and chronic high blood sugar can cause the body to lose vitamins (especially in the urine). Further, some dietary restrictions also lead to a gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes commonly show deficiencies in vitamins such as D and B-group vitamins. Below, we look at key vitamins that are often low in diabetic people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin D deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is found in foods like fatty fish, mushrooms, eggs, and fortified dairy. Studies show that vitamin D deficiency is very common in diabetes. One recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37313077/#:~:text=Results%20Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20was,Increasing%20awareness%20about%20a" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found that about 74% of type 2 diabetics had vitamin D levels below the normal range. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that having diabetes is itself a risk factor for low vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D in diabetes is problematic because vitamin D helps with calcium absorption and supports bone, muscle, and immune health. Deficiency can lead to weak bones and muscle aches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B12 deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 is found in animal foods and is needed for red blood cell production and nerve function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficiency of B12 is surprisingly common in diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes. Much of this is because of metformin, the most common diabetes drug for type 2. Mayo Clinic notes that some people who take metformin may get B-12 deficiency and might need supplements. Over time, metformin interferes with B12 absorption, causing levels to drop. At the same time, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3649932/#:~:text=Vitamin%20B12%20is%20an%20essential,B12%2C%20proposed%20pathophysiological%20mechanisms%20of" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;people &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;with long-standing type 1 diabetes sometimes develop autoimmune gastritis or pernicious anemia, which also blocks B12 absorption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thiamine (Vitamin B1) deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In diabetes, thiamine levels tend to fall for two reasons. First, high blood sugar speeds up the loss of thiamine in urine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jocmr.org/index.php/jocmr/article/view/890/463#:~:text=thiamine%20deficiency%20,increase%20in%20thiamine%20transporter%20expression" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;report that people with diabetes lose thiamine much faster through the kidneys than non-diabetics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin B6 Deficiency&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) is important for nerve and blood cell health. Research suggests that vitamin B6 levels tend to be lower in people with diabetes. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/21/10/3669#:~:text=Epidemiological%20and%20experimental%20studies%20indicated,against%20diabetes%20and%20cancer%20is" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;found a clear inverse association between B6 levels and diabetes, meaning “people with diabetes often have lower B6”. Chronic inflammation and high blood sugar may raise the body’s need for B6, and limited research indicates many diabetics do not get enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin C Deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an antioxidant most commonly found in fruits and vegetables. People with diabetes often have lower vitamin C levels than healthy people. A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fjps.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s43094-020-00040-2#:~:text=The%20prevalence%20rate%20of%20hypovitaminosis,predictors%20of%20vitamin%20C%20deficiencies" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;of type 2 diabetics found 55% had subnormal vitamin C (either “deficient” or “inadequate”). In other words, more than half of those patients did not meet the recommended vitamin C level. This deficiency may be due to higher oxidative stress (which uses up vitamin C) and poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

			&lt;p&gt;If you spend any time in the wellness corners of TikTok or Instagram, you'll &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thewellnesswaysjordan/video/7436921015961242923?q=patrick%20flyn%20sleep&amp;amp;t=1750967908904"&gt;see claims&lt;/a&gt; women need one to two hours more sleep than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does the research actually say? And how does this relate to what's going on in real life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we'll see, who gets to sleep, and for how long, is a complex mix of biology, psychology and societal expectations. It also depends on how you measure sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/losing-just-one-nights-sleep-changes-your-immune-system-study-finds?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Losing Just One Night's Sleep Changes Your Immune System, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_168370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168370" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/WomenCoveringEyesFromLightInDarkBed-e1752798905748.jpg" alt="Woman covering eyes from light shining on dark bed" class="wp-image-168370 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-168370" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Extra social demands on women do not help. (skynesher/E+/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the evidence say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers usually measure sleep in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;by asking people how much they sleep (known as self-reporting). But people are &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/41/6/zsy057/4986872"&gt;surprisingly inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; at estimating how much sleep they get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using objective tools, such as research-grade, wearable sleep trackers or the gold-standard polysomnography, which records brain waves, breathing and movement while you sleep during a sleep study in a lab or clinic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the objective data, well-conducted studies usually show women sleep about 20 minutes more than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One global study of nearly 70,000 people who wore wearable sleep trackers found a consistent, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/44/2/zsaa169/5901589?login=false"&gt;small difference&lt;/a&gt; between men and women across age groups. For example, the sleep difference between men and women aged 40–44 was about 23–29 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another large study using polysomnography found women slept &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/216692"&gt;about 19 minutes longer&lt;/a&gt; than men. In this study, women also spent more time in deep sleep: about 23 percent of the night compared to about 14 percent for men. The study also found only men's quality of sleep declined with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key caveat to these findings is that our individual sleep needs vary considerably. Women may sleep slightly more on average, just as they are slightly shorter on average. But there is no one-size-fits-all sleep duration, just as there is no universal height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggesting every woman needs 20 extra minutes (let alone two hours) misses the point. It's the same as insisting all women should be shorter than all men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though women tend to sleep a little longer and deeper, they consistently report &lt;a href="https://www.scielosp.org/article/gs/2017.v31n1/18-22/en/?uid=fe7f4167s16"&gt;poorer sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. They're also about &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/29/1/85/2708069"&gt;40 percent more likely&lt;/a&gt; to be diagnosed with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mismatch between lab findings and the real world is a well-known puzzle in sleep research, and there are many reasons for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, many research studies don't consider mental health problems, medications, alcohol use and hormonal fluctuations. This filters out the very factors that shape sleep in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mismatch between the lab and the bedroom also reminds us &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/45/10/zsac187/6668259"&gt;sleep doesn't happen in a vacuum&lt;/a&gt;. Women's sleep is shaped by a complex mix of biological, psychological and social factors, and this complexity is hard to capture in individual studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Let's start with biology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep problems &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811414001199"&gt;begin to diverge&lt;/a&gt; between the sexes around puberty. They spike again during pregnancy, after birth and during perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluctuating levels of ovarian hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811414001199"&gt;seem to explain&lt;/a&gt; some of these sex differences in sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, many girls and women report poorer sleep &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399903000679"&gt;during the premenstrual phase&lt;/a&gt; just before their periods, when estrogen and progesterone begin to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-documented hormonal influence on our sleep is the decline in estrogen during perimenopause. This is linked to increased sleep disturbances, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0369811414001199#bib0440"&gt;particularly waking at 3am&lt;/a&gt; and struggling to get back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health conditions also play a part in women's sleep health. &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-72102-6_6"&gt;Thyroid disorders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/iron-deficiency"&gt;iron deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, are more common in women and are closely linked to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12875-016-0545-5"&gt;fatigue and disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How about psychology?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are at &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(16)30358-3/abstract"&gt;much higher risk&lt;/a&gt; of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="168360" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety and trauma-related disorders. These very often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369209603226"&gt;accompany sleep problems and fatigue&lt;/a&gt;. Cognitive patterns, such as worry and rumination, are also more common in women and &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15402002.2015.1083022"&gt;known to affect sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women are also prescribed &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bjpsych-open/article/antidepressant-prescribing-patterns-in-australia/08E1231DAE09B29D4BDCB24248A9D968"&gt;antidepressants more often&lt;/a&gt; than men, and these medications tend to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1744-6163.2009.00221.x"&gt;affect sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Society also plays a role&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caregiving and emotional labour still fall disproportionately on women. Government data released this year suggests Australian women perform an average &lt;a href="https://genderequality.gov.au/status-women-report-cards/2025-report-card"&gt;nine more hours of unpaid care and work each week&lt;/a&gt; than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many women manage to put enough time aside for sleep, their opportunities for daytime rest are often scarce. This puts a lot of pressure on sleep to deliver all the restoration women need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my work with patients, we often untangle the threads woven into their experience of fatigue. While poor sleep is the obvious culprit, fatigue can also signal something deeper, such as underlying health issues, emotional strain, or too-high expectations of themselves. Sleep is certainly part of the picture, but it's rarely the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, rates of iron deficiency (which we know is &lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/iron-deficiency"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt; in women and linked to sleep problems) are also higher &lt;a href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/iron-deficiency"&gt;in the reproductive years&lt;/a&gt;. This is just as many women are raising children and grappling with the "juggle" and the "mental load".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women in perimenopause &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5259896"&gt;are often navigating&lt;/a&gt; full-time work, teenagers, ageing parents and 3am hot flashes. These women may have adequate or even high-quality sleep (according to objective measures), but that doesn't mean they wake feeling restored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most existing research also ignores gender-diverse populations. This limits our understanding of how sleep is shaped not just by biology, but by things such as identity and social context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While women sleep longer and better in the lab, they face more barriers to feeling rested in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do women need more sleep than men? On average, yes, a little. But more importantly, women need more support and opportunity to recharge and recover across the day, and at night.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/259985/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beef gets a bad rap. Yes, red meat is high in saturated fat and if eaten in excess it can increase the risk for heart disease and contribute to issues like obesity, cancer, and diabetes. But beef is also a great source of protein and iron, and it can contribute to a healthy diet if you choose the right type and limit your intake to three portions per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The key is buying lean cuts, which contain less than 10 grams of fat per serving. &lt;a href="http://foodmysteries.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Registered Dietitian Angel Luk&lt;/a&gt; recommends looking for options with the least amount of saturated fat. "The amount of saturated fat is an important consideration for people living with high cholesterol," she says. "Generally speaking, aiming for less than 16 grams of saturated fat a day is a heart healthy approach. Lean cuts of red meat, such as round, sirloin, or loin, are lower in saturated fat and can be part of a healthy diet, providing important nutrients such as iron, zinc, B vitamins and protein." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beef can only be labeled as lean if it complies with the regulations set by the USDA, so check the package for the special marking. It's different from the grading label producers use (for example, when you see a cut marked as "Prime" or "Select"), which has to do with marbling. The key words you're looking for are "lean" or "extra-lean". You can ask your butcher for a &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/695592/steak-guide-cuts-types/" target="_blank"&gt;guide to different cuts&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;h2 class=""&gt;Avoid marbling and processed beef&lt;/h2&gt;

                    &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;
                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Andrey Starostin/Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While marbling leads to delicious flavor, unfortunately, it does not contribute to a healthy heart. Prime doesn't equal lean, so even the most expensive T-bone and porterhouse steaks should be avoided. Go for Choice and Select cuts, which are typically cheaper. "Select beef tends to be the leanest," Luk explains, "making it a better choice for people opting for red meat as part of their saturated fat 'budget.'"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Some lean cuts include chuck roast, shoulder roast, and arm roast, which all benefit from slow cooking. You can &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1719052/how-to-smoke-chuck-roast/" target="_blank"&gt;smoke chuck roast&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1772550/how-long-cook-pot-roast-oven-tender/" target="_blank"&gt;cook a pot roast in the oven &lt;/a&gt;with any option. As for steak, sirloin tip side is the leanest option, with just five grams of fat per serving, but top sirloin makes for an &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1421551/tips-cook-sirloin-steak-juicy-tender/" target="_blank"&gt;unbelievably juicy steak&lt;/a&gt;. Anything with less than five grams of fat is considered extra-lean by the USDA, and if you can get something organic or grass-fed, even better. As for ground beef, look for the lowest fat percentage you can find, like 95% lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The big thing to really avoid is anything that is ultra-processed. "Ultra processed beef such as hot dogs and sausages, and cuts with high amounts of saturated fat like ribeye with a lot of visible marbling are the least healthy," Luk suggests. You can treat yourself once in a while, but if you want to watch things, make sure it's lean beef in your rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Generally, across the country, about 8 to 10 percent of kids have asthma. In the Amish kids, it’s probably 1 to 2 percent,” said Carole Ober, chair of human genetics at the University of Chicago. “A few of them do have allergies, but at much, much lower rates compared to the general population.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter | align_items_center border_bottom border_gray border_top border_1 container font_primary width_full margin_vertical_32 padding_vertical_24 is_article"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter_cta | border_box width_full no_image"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter_grid newsletter_grid--1"&gt;&lt;span class="title | bold font_secondary margin_bottom"&gt;Get Starting Point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter_grid newsletter_grid--2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter_grid newsletter_grid--3"&gt;&lt;span class="newsletter_widget_description"&gt;A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Now, Ober and other researchers are trying to discover what makes Amish and other traditional farming communities unique, in the hopes of developing a protective treatment that could be given to young children. For instance, a probiotic or essential oil that contains substances found in farm dust, such as microbes and the molecules they produce, could stimulate children’s immune systems in a way that prevents allergic disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Certain kinds of farming practices, particularly the very traditional ones, have this extraordinary protective effect in the sense that, in these communities, asthma and allergies are virtually unknown,” said Donata Vercelli, a professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of Arizona. “The studies that have been done in these farming populations are critical because they tell us that protection is an attainable goal.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Amish are members of a Christian group who practice traditional farming - many live on single-family dairy farms - and use horses for fieldwork and transportation. As of 2024, around 395,000 Amish live in the United States, concentrated mostly in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Over the past century, the incidence of allergic diseases - including hay fever (allergic rhinitis), asthma, food allergies and eczema - has increased dramatically. Hay fever, or an allergic reaction to tree, grass and weed pollens, emerged as the first recognized allergic disease in the early 1800s, climbing to epidemic levels in Europe and North America by 1900.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The 1960s saw a sharp increase in the prevalence of pediatric asthma, a condition in which the airways tighten when breathing in an allergen. From the 1990s onward, there has been an upswing in the developed world in food allergies, including cow’s milk, peanut and egg allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Urbanization, air pollution, dietary changes and an indoor lifestyle are often cited as possible factors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

Strachan wondered whether unhygienic contact with older siblings served as a protection against allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Subsequent findings have given support to the hygiene hypothesis, such as that children who grow up with more household pets are less likely to develop asthma, hay fever or eczema. Perhaps even more beneficial than having older siblings or pets, however, is growing up on a farm. (More than 150 years ago, hay fever was known as an “aristocratic disease,” almost wholly confined to the upper classes of society. Farmers appeared relatively immune.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This “farm effect” has been confirmed by studies on agricultural populations around the world, including in the United States, Europe, Asia and South America. But even among farming communities, the most pronounced effect appears to be in the Amish. In a study of 60 schoolchildren by Ober, Vercelli and their colleagues, the prevalence of asthma was four times lower in the Amish as compared with the Hutterites, another U.S. farming community with a similar genetic ancestry and lifestyle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The prevalence of allergic sensitization - the development of antibodies to allergens and the first step to developing an allergy - was six times higher in the Hutterites. The researchers first ruled out a genetic cause; in fact, an analysis showed that the Amish and Hutterite children were remarkably similar in their ancestral roots. Instead, the main difference between these two populations seemed to be the amount of exposure as young children to farm animals or barns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The Hutterite kids and pregnant moms don’t go into the animal barns. Kids aren’t really exposed to the animal barns until they’re like 12 or so, when they start learning how to do the work on the farm,” Ober said. “The Amish kids are in and out of the cow barns all day long from an early age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;When analyzing samples of Amish and Hutterite house dust, they found a microbial load almost seven times higher in Amish homes. Later experiments showed that the airways of mice that inhaled Amish dust had dramatically reduced asthmalike symptoms when exposed to allergens. Mice that inhaled Hutterite dust did not receive the same benefit.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

In 2023, their analysis of farm dust found proteins that act like delivery trucks, loaded with molecules produced by microbes and plants. When these transport proteins deliver their cargo to the mucus that lines the respiratory tract, it creates a protective environment that regulates airway responses and prevents inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We don’t really talk about the hygiene hypothesis as much anymore because we now understand that it’s not really about how hygienic you’re living,” said Kirsi Järvinen-Seppo, director of the Center for Food Allergy at the University of Rochester Medical Center. “It’s more like a microbial hypothesis, since beneficial bacteria that colonize the gut and other mucosal surfaces play a significant role.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;During the first year or two of life, a baby’s immune system is rapidly developing and highly malleable by environmental stimuli, such as bacteria. Some experts believe that exposing young children to certain types of beneficial bacteria can engage and shape the growing immune system in a way that reduces the risk of allergic diseases later in life. Farm dust contains a hodgepodge of bacteria shed from livestock and animal feed that isn’t harmful enough to cause illness, but does effectively train the immune system to become less responsive to allergens later in life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In 2021, Järvinen-Seppo and her colleagues compared the gut microbiomes of 65 Old Order Mennonite infants from a rural community in New York with 39 urban/suburban infants from nearby Rochester. Like the Amish, the Old Order Mennonites follow a traditional agrarian lifestyle. Almost three-fourths of Mennonite infants in the study were colonized with B. infantis, a bacterium associated with lower rates of allergic diseases, in contrast to 21 percent of Rochester infants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The colonization rate is very low in the United States and other Western countries, compared to very high rates in Mennonite communities, similar to some developing countries,” Järvinen-Seppo said. “This mirrors the rates of autoimmune and allergic diseases.” These clues about the origin of the farm effect represent a step toward the prevention of allergic diseases, Järvinen-Seppo says.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Whatever form the treatment takes, the impact on prevention of allergic diseases, which affect millions of people worldwide and reduce quality of life, could be enormous, experts say.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I don’t know that we can give every family a cow. … But we are learning from these time-honored and very stable environments what type of substances and exposures are needed,” Vercelli said. “Once we know that, I don’t think there will be any impediment to creating protective strategies along these lines.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Boston Globe</author><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jul 2025 14:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNdzFUNFBUVldHN3VMT1NPQ2dlcTdrV3Y5MVQ1UllsYnY0N3U5azUycUZGam9iTVdKOTlteHI0MVY2WDF3bGdKWlZxZ181T2hxMTdCbnZSYUI0MXhmcGdMNUpHUVRPZnFmRjJkZnB1UUFtUms2UzNxamVteHg1UDUzNExBSVI1amotdHFlTTlleXpfMWNPMlFBQ1RtdUtUZGFMSV9YRkhxSQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
