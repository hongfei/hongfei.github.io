In dry weather, the spores spread as dry dust and soil are kicked up because of construction, agriculture or wind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think climate change is the main reason to explain this type of dramatic explosion,” Yang told SFGATE. “I don’t think anything else can explain this type of phenomenon.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang said his lab used to see about one case of Valley fever a month, but now it often sees five cases per month, including an occasional pediatric case of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When children get this kind of very severe [Valley fever,] it’s very devastating,” Yang said, explaining that infection can disseminate and spread to the bone in children, requiring chronic treatments. “They’re not going to live normally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. John Galgiani, the director for the University of Arizona Valley Fever Center for Excellence, said one explanation for the increase in cases is that health officials have streamlined some of the reporting process. Galgiani pointed out that patients who tested positive for Valley fever used to have to be tracked down to confirm their symptoms before their cases were reported to the state, and in recent years, that requirement has been loosened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The actual impact of the disease is probably not as great a change as the numbers appear,” Galgiani told SFGATE. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani said while cases have increased, they are still variable, and occasionally, the number of annual cases has sometimes dipped below previous levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that it looks higher now doesn’t mean it’s going to be even higher next year, and then higher after that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani did echo Yang’s concern that changes in climate could push the fungus into new areas of the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s estimates that climate change, or the long-term effect of climate change will increase the distribution of the infection across the western United States, all the way to the Canadian border,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can cause severe fatigue, cough, fever, night sweats and muscle pain, and it can last weeks to months. In severe cases, the spores can &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverSymptoms.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;disseminate&lt;/a&gt; in the body, infecting the bones, brain or skin. In these cases, a person may need to be on anti-fungal medications for the rest of their lives, according to Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valley fever can also be deadly, with 1 out of 10 people hospitalized for the disease dying from it, &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverBasics.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;according &lt;/a&gt;to the California Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-3" data-large-id="Inline-5" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some people will have severe symptoms, Yang said a majority of people will either not get sick or have mild symptoms if they come into contact with the spores. Since so many people do not get diagnosed, the actual number of cases is likely about 10 to 18 times higher than what is reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/ValleyFeverGroupsAtRisk.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;most at risk for developing Valley fever&lt;/a&gt; are those who live or work in agriculture or construction in areas where it’s endemic. People over 60, pregnant people, people who have diabetes and those with compromised immune systems are at higher risk of having serious or debilitating symptoms if they get sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galgiani said if you think you could be at risk and start to get symptoms, you should get tested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-4" data-large-id="Inline-6" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The recommendation is, if you have pneumonia in Bakersfield, for example, or other endemic places, or if you visited there, you should be tested,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 23:46:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNVW5ycy0wRS1GX0x2ZlRFTXJWSXZsTFZUamdYWlAtMUUzTlJEMDMzRFlPaHI3TmNBOWpMV3dXQnl4bHh5QVpOVnkyX0ZNdFRFMnExbUVBbFV1X3I2YUNkaWN3VVVtUnlTV2pPZU5KRmFwdTByNkR5SV9wa1JCZURLeHhuaVF0V3ZScE4xOVphNzJnTnc3</guid></item><item><title>蒙大拿州西部报告2例新的麻疹病例- NBC蒙大拿州</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPNUwwSmZWT3dPdFluTEFsd0lPQWc3NU9mVDBoS29adEk5eS1IYm9kb2hOX25LX2lzMjhjQm94RkVieHFHTzA2MDh2aDg0UUFodlV2bldtelp4Y29rSGVlZ2tHWFNZVDlOU1V0eTRJdVZqZ3VlOHVWejFpWmdEWmN5cUlYTHJrMzU4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;BOZEMAN, Mont.  — &lt;/span&gt;On Aug. 18, two new measles cases were reported in western Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gallatin County Health Department reported a new exposure site that occurred on Aug. 12 at Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport on Southwest flight 2740. The time of exposure was from 6:37 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. According to the airport’s website, Southwest flight 2740 was inbound to Bozeman from Denver, CO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those exposed are advised to monitor for symptoms until Sept. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in Lewis and Clark County, the first measles case in decades was reported in a resident.

If this damage affects genes that control growth and death, mutations accumulate, allowing abnormal cells to multiply unchecked, eventually forming tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nutrition scientists in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/iran/index.html" id="mol-b94af090-7c66-11f0-ba99-0d96d46a8b7e"&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/afghanistan/index.html" id="mol-b94a0630-7c66-11f0-ba99-0d96d46a8b7e"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; reported that consuming almonds, around two large handfuls, significantly improved oxidative stress markers by reducing DNA and lipid damage while boosting antioxidant defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits were strongest with higher almond intake, likely due to their vitamin E, polyphenols, and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results varied between studies, though, possibly due to differences in the ways almonds were prepared, such as salting or roasting, or the study subjects’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds are widely recognized &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13334127/Eat-nuts-seeds-fight-disease-Healthy-snacks-added-5-day-guidance-boost-nations-health-report-suggests.html"&gt;as a nutritious food&lt;/a&gt;, but quantifying their specific health benefits has proven difficult due to inconsistent research findings stemming from key variables across studies, including differences in almond preparation methods (such as roasting versus raw), study durations, and characteristics of the people in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research consolidates previous studies and fragmented findings to better identify how and how much almonds benefit the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eating roughly 60g almonds daily (about 2 handfuls) reduced oxidative damage, lowering DNA harm and lipid damage (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After reviewing all the research, scientists focused on eight high-quality studies involving 424 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The studies tested different groups, including healthy adults, smokers, and people with chronic diseases, using almond doses ranging from a small handful, about five grams, to about six handfuls, or roughly 168g, per day for one to six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds' health benefits depend on the serving size. Eating at least two large handfuls daily, about 60g, made a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating this amount reduced cell membrane damage by a statistically significant 0.46 units, lowered DNA damage by 5.83 units, and boosted the body's natural defenses by 2.02 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers have been trying to prove almonds’ anti-cancer impacts for years, since the 1997 report of the World Cancer Research Fund, which concluded that, while there are ‘theoretical reasons to believe that diets high in nuts and seeds might protect against some cancers, the evidence is currently lacking.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over two decades of research has revealed important connections between nut consumption &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://scijournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jsfa.2659?casa_token=4R4dHrw8ehEAAAAA%3A30JFIBoxJen8wtjhJCChlNOz_JLhuBadWr9Llhclpp3aaa4_DXQs243otC9hP88qobJ0-1jlZECcE_M"&gt;and cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt;, with almonds emerging as a particularly promising food in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Large observational studies spanning multiple countries have found that people who regularly eat nuts tend to have lower rates of certain cancers, particularly prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The evidence also suggests a potential protective effect against colon cancer in women, with those consuming just a small handful of nuts daily, about six grams, showing measurable benefits compared to those who did not eat almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The figure, published in Advances in Nutrition, shows how eating different amounts of nuts affects a person's risk of serious health problems. The solid red line shows whether more nuts lower risk (when the line goes down) or do not make much difference (when it is flat). The blue shaded area shows the confidence interval. When it is narrow, researchers are more certain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Population-level findings are supported by laboratory research showing that almonds may actively combat cancer development at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Animal studies have shown that eating an almond-rich diet can reduce the formation of precancerous growths in the digestive tract and may trigger natural anti-tumor defenses in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almonds pack a powerful nutritional punch, making them a favorite snack among dietitians and nutritionists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831323000686#:~:text=An%20intake%20of%2028%20g,and%20diabetes%20incidence%20were%20mixed."&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; showed that eating 28 grams of nuts daily, such as almonds, walnuts, cashews, and pistachios, was associated with a 21 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks, strokes, and atrial fibrillation, an 11 percent reduced risk of dying from cancer, and a 22 percent lower risk of premature death from any cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The benefits likely come from their unique combination of healthy fats, fiber, and antioxidants that improve cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support blood vessel function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of being rich in vitamins that protect cells from oxidative damage, such as vitamin E, almonds contain monounsaturated fats that lower ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested that eating a handful of almonds with a meal can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent, an effect comparable to a diabetes drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These findings support almonds as a functional food for oxidation management,’ the researchers said, adding that more rigorously controlled studies are required before implementing broad dietary guidelines to include more almonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research has suggested that eating a handful of almonds with a meal can reduce blood sugar spikes by up to 30 percent (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers did not examine toxicity, but overeating almonds can have drawbacks. Two heaping handfuls of almonds contain around seven grams of fiber, around 27 percent of the daily recommended amount. Too much too fast could cause bloating, gas or diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, overeating almonds can cause vitamin E toxicity if the person is also taking a vitamin E supplement or a multivitamin containing vitamin E. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin E acts as a blood thinner. Very high doses may increase bruising or bleeding risk, especially if a person is taking blood-thinning medication, such as warfarin or aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who are susceptible to kidney stones should also moderate their almond consumption. Almonds contain oxalates. The body converts excess oxalates into crystals that may form stones, especially when combined with low fluid intake or other risk factors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, a person would have to eat magnitudes more almonds than what is typical.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 400mg vitamin E supplement plus 60g almonds, 15mg, is safe, reaching the 1,000mg upper limit would require eating 5.3 lbs (2.4kg) of almonds daily alongside the supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, research shows the oxalate content in typical almond portions poses little risk when consumed as part of a balanced diet with adequate hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 21:28:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNVjFGYWo4VXpBSUZoTVlaakpLeDJTYXJQSzAwNkxCNFZOcmtHeVZSYnBQN1M1S3JJdTI5NjhnUTdwMGdWdVVZOFBrT3RSMTdXaDZNSnhEX2phdHRoUEdHcUJGTHFyMzZiVHRhYURQZ0Z4LXZSNzFhak5ta1dLbFQwQ2dwRUdWZ0Zmc2xFQ1dkNGFlMVQ3TXNOTENfcTNXekp4cHZfNkJR0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBWVnJKZG8tb3BZekdVT3c0YzBEYkdmVGVWV1EzLUFHTkRaWXI2ZFdXYWlDWlBnSUQ3blBTeUJQTWpVUzhfb0daRlk5VW5uTEc1ZTIxMTdGVlZ4dDNRdll2UUxpMUpiREFWdHlndXdLaW5KVWxnc05WbVh6cGhTVXYyLUphNEpjUHRXc1hodEdQUE5VY1pjQVM3YV9PcEtMTG9uanc4VE4wQUUwbw</guid></item><item><title>州政府表示，新泽西州居民感染疟疾可能是几十年来首例“本土”病例- NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QSHR6ZSSZFCT5GJCF4MC2KTYFA"&gt;Investigators are trying to determine whether a Morris County resident infected with malaria represents the first locally-acquired case of the disease in New Jersey since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2A6GIR2SI5HDPBYGQ3UILM6JH4"&gt;The resident, who has no international travel history, was not identified.

              &lt;p&gt;A woman’s supposed pregnancy turned out to be something much stranger. In a recent report from her doctors, they detail how the woman had developed an incredibly rare form of ovarian cancer that mimicked the symptoms of pregnancy, even causing a positive pregnancy test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors in India &lt;a href="https://www.oncoscience.us/article/622/text/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; the case of mistaken identity earlier this July in the journal Oncoscience. After first suspecting the woman had an ectopic pregnancy, the doctors instead discovered a large and rare type of tumor in her right ovary. Thankfully, the cancer was removed before it spread elsewhere, and the woman seems to have responded well to treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A pregnancy that wasn’t&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the 36-year-old woman visited doctors three months into having intermittent bouts of heavy menstrual bleeding. She tested positive for a pregnancy on a urine test, and when doctors performed a physical examination, they felt a solid mass along her abdomen consistent with having a 20-week-old fetus. An initial ultrasound appeared to show that the woman was experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, a condition where the embryo forms outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube (ectopic pregnancies are inherently non-viable). After conducting more extensive imaging, they found that she actually had cancer in her right ovary, most likely a choriocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24863-choriocarcinoma"&gt;Choriocarcinomas&lt;/a&gt; are tumors mainly formed from the cells that become the placenta during a pregnancy. It’s an especially dangerous cancer since the tumors tend to grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. The woman’s doctors soon performed surgery to assess the progression of her cancer and to treat it if possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They successfully removed the tumor, along with the woman’s uterus, ovaries, and surrounding lymph nodes. Though relatively large, the tumor was still in an early stage of development and hadn’t metastasized. When the doctors looked closer, though, they found her cancer was even weirder than first thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Exceedingly rare’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Choriocarcinomas are usually gestational, meaning they’re linked to pregnancy; oftentimes, the tumor will even arise from an abnormal and non-viable pregnancy. But the woman’s cancer was a non-gestational ovarian choriocarcinoma (NGOC), which only accounts for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35328112/"&gt;0.6%&lt;/a&gt; of all reported ovarian germ cell tumors (a germ cell being the actual egg). What’s more, the cancer was a pure NGOC, an “exceedingly rare” subtype made completely out of germ cells and not any other kinds of tissues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An image of the woman’s tumor, as well as her uterus and a benign ovarian cyst, can be seen &lt;a href="https://www.oncoscience.us/output/cache/622/F3.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but be warned, it’s not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While these cancers aren’t tied to pregnancy, they do cause the body to produce high levels of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Women also produce high levels of hCG during pregnancy, and some tests detect pregnancy through measuring hCG, explaining the woman’s positive result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“NGOC is a rare, distinct, and highly aggressive tumor that predominantly affects young, reproductive-aged women,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in this case, the cancer appears to have been caught early enough in time. Following surgery, the woman was placed on chemotherapy. And her most recent tests showed that her hCG level had returned to normal, indicating a complete treatment response, according to the doctors.

A 2023 study of nearly 1,000 adults by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine compared the rate of cognitive decline over a three-year period between people who did and didn't receive hearing aids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hearing aids could slash the risk of dementia by almost two thirds, new findings suggest (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers found those who received hearing aids had a 48 percent reduction in the rate of cognitive decline compared with people who didn't get the devices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In response, Professor Frank Lin, of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, said: 'These results provide compelling evidence that treating hearing loss is a powerful tool to protect cognitive function in later life, and possibly, over the long term, delay a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But any cognitive benefits of treating age-related hearing loss are likely to vary depending on an individual's risk of cognitive decline.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with hearing loss putting an increased workload on the brain, Professor Lin believes that it can also make people feel more isolated and less socially engaged, which can contribute to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained: 'When you have hearing loss, you may not be as socially engaged. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You may become more lonely or withdrawn. One thing we know about risk of dementia and cognitive decline is that if people don't remain engaged with cognitively stimulating activities, it is not good for the brain.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hearing loss has been strongly linked to neurogenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, but it has so far been unclear whether it is a symptom or one of the causes behind the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age-related hearing loss is extremely common, with an estimated one in three people over 60 in the US having some degree of hearing loss, with women at a slightly higher risk than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, only around a third of this population use hearing aids.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, over 7 million individuals aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease with this number projected to nearly double to 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the US, over 7 million individuals aged 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease with this number projected to nearly double to 13 million by 2050&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is thought to be caused by a build-up of amyloid and tau in the brain, which clump together and from plaques and tangles that make it harder for the brain to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, the brain struggles to cope with this damage and dementia symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is more&lt;span&gt; prevalent among females, with around two-thirds of cases occurring in women.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The increased risk among women is attributed to a combination of factors, including women's longer life expectancy, hormonal changes associated with menopause, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle influences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other risks for dementia include high blood pressure, lack of physical activity, smoking, alcohol use and uncontrolled diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids can be purchased directly from retail stores or online without a prescription or professional fitting by an audiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, audiologists can also provide prescription-strength hearing aids, which may be necessary for more severe hearing loss or for those who prefer a customized fitting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Age-related hearing loss is extremely common, with an estimated one in three people over 60 in the US having some degree of hearing loss, with women at a slightly higher risk than men. However, only around a third of this population use hearing aids (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Many warning signs of dementia are often confused with normal aging. Common early symptoms include forgetfulness, repeating themselves, sudden changes in mood, inability to speak, and personality changes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite them being readily available, many people still don't seek help or wear hearing aids because of the perceived stigma around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, with technological advancements and a growing preference for sleek, discreet designs, hearing aids are becoming increasingly popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hearing aids market is expected to reach $45.68 billion by 2031, an increase from $28.75 billion in 2024, which experts say is largely due to an aging population.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has suggested hearing loss can contribute to a faster rate of brain wasting as well as prompt social isolation – another known risk factor of mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists also believe it may also make the brain work harder to the detriment of other mental functions like thinking and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The agency says it has been more than 42 days since a new case was reported in any of the counties that previously showed evidence of ongoing transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The outbreak has contributed to the worst year for measles cases in the United States in more than 30 years. As of August 5, the most recent update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a total of 1,356 confirmed measles cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;have been reported across the country this year&lt;/a&gt;. For comparison, there were just 285 measles cases in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The Texas outbreak began in January in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates. More than two-thirds of the state’s reported cases were in children, and two children in Texas died of the virus. Both were unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. Over the course of the outbreak, a total of 99 people were hospitalized, representing 13 percent of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-is-how-measles-can-kill-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-vaccines-vitamin-a/"&gt;temporarily weaken the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, leaving individuals vulnerable to secondary infections such as pneumonia. In rare cases, it can also lead to swelling of the brain and long-term neurological damage. It can also cause pregnancy complications, such as premature birth and babies with low birth weight. The best way to prevent the disease is the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. One dose of the vaccine is 93 percent effective against measles while two doses is 97 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A measles outbreak is considered over after 42 days if no new cases are discovered because it is double the disease’s maximum incubation period—the longest time it can take between when a person is exposed to the virus and when they develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. The West Texas outbreak has been linked to cases in neighboring states, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-cases-are-soaring-in-mexico/"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the Texas outbreak has ended, measles cases are still being reported elsewhere in the country. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, 40 other states have reported cases, and a total of 32 US outbreaks have been reported in 2025, compared with 16 outbreaks in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The ongoing outbreaks put the country’s measles elimination status at risk. The designation means there is no ongoing domestic spread of measles for longer than 12 months. The US achieved that status in 2000 after years of increasing vaccination rates but &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/can-us-measles-outbreaks-be-stopped/"&gt;almost lost it in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when measles cases swept through undervaccinated Orthodox Jewish communities in New York for much of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As vaccination rates continue to decline in the US, public health researchers warn that outbreaks of measles and other diseases are likely. One recent peer-reviewed paper found that at current state-level vaccination rates, measles could &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-say-measles-likely-to-become-endemic-in-us-polio-diphtheria-rubella/"&gt;reestablish itself and become endemic again&lt;/a&gt; within the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 18:30:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5rbk5DSFRXSTZhWHNJZWJLR19sbGdidTAyOUdORUZIVGJIZUJBQkRMTXRZWTVIMTBWclBqWlhxWlMtV1poRXBzVWZUZUM1VkJPVElsX1pRZUE3cjVfYjNlLXc0dTVVLWZiYkZCZzFQQzRlZ05HUmpzTnRR</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的疫苗豁免请求在7月份激增，因为一些专家担心会有更多家庭选择退出- ABC13休斯顿</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOZUtFek4tclRwZllkcmNIeDR4bHNkZDhEc3ZpTXlPMDNaOTNRTWRnVzNUVHA2NDVQVnFZcmM1N0JoU0JxbXNLZ1dFUlppX0NzSVVHVDJ2NWx3dmhiQnRTVEJHX2NNWjFHdWp1OHMyY0JpVzNTNURPaXBsUV9vVnRmdmxtZzcwQlJsZEpNY2M5SEtMOTNIRkU2eHppWlJYNTVJMEV0czJGYlRDS1FOWVRsM1hn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;Texas school districts are coming back from summer with a rising number of parents asking for vaccine exemption forms and a new law that will make those documents even easier to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Combined with funding cuts to public vaccination programs, chilling effects of immigration policies on health care, and the wearying battle by school nurses to balance parental consent and overall student body health, Texas schools are on track to have the lowest vaccination rates in decades if exemption rates continue to climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I do think that there is a problem - period - that is worse than we have known about previously," said Terri Burke, executive director of The Immunization Partnership, which advocates for public policies that support increased access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since 2018, the requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for a vaccine exemption form have doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In July, ahead of the new school year, the state received 17,197 requests for a vaccine exemption form, 36% higher than the number reported in July 2023. Because each requestor can have forms for up to eight individuals, the number of children those forms covered also soared - 23,231 in July 2023 compared to 30,596 in July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Now, as some public health departments indicate there are drops in the number of poorer children coming to them to get vaccinated during the summer months, and a new Sept. 1 law that will make the vaccination exemption form downloadable instead of it being mailed, vaccine experts fear herd immunity will be tougher to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Rebecca Hardy, president of Texans for Vaccine Choice, which successfully lobbied for the easier exemption process, suggests the fears are overblown. She said she hasn't seen an increase in interest in exemption forms and insists that her organization exists to "support all parents, regardless of how they vaccinate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Vaccination picture for Texas &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vaccination effectiveness relies on having enough people immunized so that those with compromised immune systems and cannot vaccinate are protected. The gold standard used by public health officials and schools is to have 95% of school-aged children vaccinated. A clear statistical picture of this school year's vaccination rates will likely not be available for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;While vaccination rates for Texas kindergarteners hover around 93%, pockets of 80% or lower exist, with some school districts reporting a high exemption rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For example, in the Austin school district during the 2024-25 school year, 79.6% of kindergarteners were up to date on the vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, a drop from 2020 when 96% were vaccinated. And in Gaines County, where the West Texas measles outbreak began in January, 77% of kindergartners were vaccinated the same year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Texas leads the nation with the most kindergartners - more than 25,000 - who were not fully vaccinated against measles, followed by Florida and California, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released last month. The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93.24% is the lowest it's been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vaccine supporters, such as Burke, told lawmakers earlier this year that legislation to make the vaccine exemption form easier to obtain would inevitably drive down vaccination rates for school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In recent weeks, Burke said her organization has had disheartening conversations with pediatricians and public health officials who say vaccine skepticism has worsened. "Their frustration is that they can't even bring up the subject with parents."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the Waco district, more than 98% of kindergartners were vaccinated, and less than 1% of students filed exemptions. Lana Scully, a school nurse in Waco, said even with the new downloadable option going into effect in September, she anticipates her rate staying low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The main nuisance for parents wasn't that exemption forms had to be mailed to them by the Texas Department of State Health Services, she said. Parents didn't want to have to take the extra step of getting it notarized. That requirement will not change when the new downloadable form is made available next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"You know there are two inconveniences of it, well, actually three," Scully explained. "One is you have to go to the health department, pick it up. One is that you have to get it notarized. And the last one is that they're only good for two years. So that kind of weeds out who's got the strong feelings versus who doesn't want to get to the doctor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scully said she has no issue with parents wanting fewer vaccinations for their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"If somebody really has a strong conviction, great," Scully said. "That's your strong conviction, and you're doing what's best for you and your family ... But if it's just, I don't feel like taking my kid to the doctor 'cause I'm sitting on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune, it's a lot easier to go get the shots."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;School challenges driving up vaccine delinquencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Funding cuts for schools have meant fewer school nurses and health aides and a crushing workload for those who remain. There's the constant managing of emergency health equipment, maintaining students' daily medication regimens, and caring for more kids with chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Finally, there's the year-round chase of parents for their child's vaccination records - or vaccine exemption forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It was a snap decision, but it was oncoming," said Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who abruptly retired from Bellaire High School in the Houston school district after 25 years in the profession. "This past year was the worst year I've ever had in school nursing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Historically, Texas public schools have been a stopgap to compel vaccinations. Students are required to be vaccinated to attend school unless they have a notarized exemption form or face being sent home until they have either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As larger urban districts combat suburban ones for students, Texas school nurses are often hearing from districts, including Houston, not to let vaccination requirements prevent students from attending school. If every student without the required paperwork were denied entry to class, schools would lose out on their basic allotment funds for each student enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There are some superintendents that will say, 'All kids come to school. I don't care if they've got their vaccines or not,'" said Karen Schwind, a past president of the Texas Association of School Nurses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In the 2024-25 school year, 2.7% of kindergarteners did not have records of the required doses of the measles vaccine and lacked an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I have kids, been hounding them for two years," Thomas recalled. "All I can do is send letters, call parents, and beg."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Houston school district confirmed to The Texas Tribune in April that "at this time, we are not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status." District officials more recently said their policy has not changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hardy, with Texans for Vaccine Choice, said her group "applauds any school that recognizes that being militant about vaccine paperwork simply makes no sense."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Whether families submit shot records, vaccine exemptions, or a mix of both, it's still just paperwork," she said. All of those things are not a "measure of a student's health and certainly irrelevant to the core mission of schools: to educate, not operate as ad hoc health clinics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Public health departments report some vaccination dips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Each year, many of the state's school-age children who have no health insurance or who are covered by Medicaid turn to public health departments for their vaccinations. Dallas and Austin public health officials have reported some decreases in visits to summer vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We typically have, like, you know, big lines, and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed," said Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. "This year it has not been that way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Huang and his staff believe threats of ICE arrests and deportations have pushed more undocumented children and their parents to stay away from vaccination. In Texas, there are an estimated 111,000 undocumented children, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Funding cuts have also contributed to the reduction of vaccinations, particularly among the uninsured and Medicaid-insured populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;During the pandemic, local health departments received a surge in federal funding. That boost allowed local health departments to "right-size" their lean immunization programs for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We had 20 to 25 team members, so we were able to see well more than 20 people (daily) or even conduct multiple clinics at a time," said Chris Crookham, program manager of the immunization unit at Austin Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Today, public health officials are now scaling back after the federal government put an early end to such funding. "Now the team is down to just seven people, and so we're capping our clinics at 20 clients only," Crookham said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In June, Austin Public Health and other local health departments braced for even more cuts, up to $28 million more in federal immunization cuts. Eventually, $1.7 million was cut from Texas and that entire amount was absorbed by DSHS through the agency's own reduction in vaccine marketing materials and other budget-tightening measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Still, that potential pause forced local health departments to start scaling back and their employees to consider other career options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That happened at Austin Public Health, where its primary staff immunization nurse will be leaving for another job at the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The damage was done," Crookham said. "We started to go through looking at a RIF (reduction in force) process, and because of that, people started looking for other jobs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Texas Tribune&lt;/a&gt;

That said, those cells were more awakened than they had been — and were therefore more likely to multiply in the future. In theory, each future infection would increase the risk that dormant cancer cells could wake up and proliferate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s worth noting that the study was conducted in rodents, and while a similar effect may occur in humans, this has not definitely been proven, Kollipara said. In addition, the study only examined cancer cells in the lungs, so it’s unclear if the infections impacted cells located in other parts of the body, she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might COVID and the flu have this effect on cancer cells?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you contract the flu or COVID, your body releases inflammatory &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24585-cytokines" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cytokines" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a3487ae4b03709c085c04d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24585-cytokines" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cytokines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that help fight the pathogen and heal damaged tissue.

To the research team, this ultimately suggests that the surge in IL-6 that follows an infection plays an essential role in igniting sleeping cancer cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Forrester suspects the link between viral infections and cancer recurrence is multifactorial. More research is needed to understand how viral infections impact cancer recurrence, but this report offers some important clues as to why breast cancer recurrence has increased since the COVID pandemic. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This study may lead to more research to determine if this type of immune response in humans has contributed to that finding,” Forrester said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for breast cancer survivors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to Forrester, the new findings reinforce how important it is for cancer survivors and people with cancer to take extra precautions to avoid getting the flu or COVID. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She recommends staying up to date with your vaccines and washing your hands thoroughly when you’re out and about. If you develop respiratory symptoms, book an appointment with a health care provider. There are prescription treatments for both COVID and the flu that can shorten the duration of the illness, and reduce the intensity of the symptoms. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kollipara said everyone should consider wearing a face mask in public if they have respiratory symptoms to help prevent the spread to cancer survivors. “Simple measures like vaccinations, masks and early treatment already provide a known benefit with minimal risk and should therefore be encouraged,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:27:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxNeGJ1cVNsandVMUNsOU93ekU5cGJrSU13QTBmRnRCX1AzYkpvSDJ4SVpMb0JKUFIyV3kyNFhRdV9nYy1RM0pUMm9saTJkc0VfMFBMWURrQ3VxYnRuVHNEc21ZOHpWZjdTT1J0X2Nwa0xhVDhqQUxIX1BnQ2pPb0dFMXlITFFSOE1z0gGOAUFVX3lxTE5XN3JEeW1jZkJOMnZsRzRXSEJtc3pUeERhdHJSQlNhRVQxNFB2ZXlvZ0dLQ0RMaERLbUtKalFhenBpQ1ZxS1E3a2s1WkpJRnlOWDBMSXFPOVN1d2pJNDhKenYzMTdjaGpXYnZYanJNbWRVSXdLQjZHRW1uSmctZFFCSEhDYXhlc2p0RXE3dHc</guid></item><item><title>令人惊讶的身体部位的大小可以预测您将如何以及何时死亡-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOR00zN1I2TTFvWENHMTduLWhLdU1HUWI2WjJOa01LMENzS3Z6azVHUkVyQjB1S0dzMGtld3ZEVWpTYS1HVkZmT2FSTUp4MWVlb3RGNGhJTnN4dVpuTDVSNjhxR1dPb2FFUV90cWFXZkwtdk84aktFRjlrWmNGYkpfaGJkZU5jRm5SZDlzLXVWZ0lBM0RSZENfeWp30gGfAUFVX3lxTE9wV3UwZS10YVBDcjRSbU1GbTd2dXJYQjRVeVlKMGZYNUtQVHN1dHBTWUZmelpyb3Z1REU0cmdyMkV2SUxSS004cUpoR0pjbG9aWVBIVTZ1QWMwcHV4UWxrZmVwcC0zT3FPOG5DZ0ViVTNYWTRnUzVKY1kyNjc1TVZsUnlma01uVk1nS2NiMlAwV2V6RmtRT0dueFlXUDVfTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An unsuspecting part of your body could reveal when you're going to die, according to research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Several studies have found evidence that suggests a person's neck size relative to the rest of their body is a predictor of various health markers, including cardiovascular risk factors, nutritional status, and even mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study by a team at Boston University found that a large neck, thicker than 17 inches for men and 14 inches for women in circumference – was linked to an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AFib is a common heart rhythm disorder in which the heart's upper chambers (atria) beat irregularly and often rapidly, disrupting the normal flow of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to palpitations, fatigue, and an increased risk of stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, the research team said there is evidence that individuals with high neck circumference have increased risk of obstructive sleep apnea, which is also associated with AFib. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long-term study, involving around 4,000 participants, looked at neck circumference compared to the circumference of a person's waist and their BMI. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because it takes into account both obesity (excess abdominal fat) and muscle mass, making it potentially a better indicator of overall health risks than BMI or waist circumference alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Several studies have found evidence that suggests a person's neck size relative to the rest of their body is a predictor of various health markers, including cardiovascular risk factors, nutritional status, and even mortality (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A healthy neck circumference to waist circumference ratio is generally considered to be less than 0.5; meaning your waist circumference should be less than twice your neck circumference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AFib is associated with an increased risk of death and can potentially shorten lifespan. A 2018 study found people with Afib had an up to four times increased risk of mortality compared to the general population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While modern treatments have improved outcomes, AFib still carries a significant risk, particularly due to complications like stroke and heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For measurement of neck circumference, participants were instructed to stand straight with the measuring tape around the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both neck and waist circumference were measured to the nearest quarter inch. Standardized protocols were used to measure height and weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that the correlation between neck circumference and increased risk of AFib persisted after taking into account traditional body fat measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, height and weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say a larger neck circumference is a proxy for excess upper body subcutaneous fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of fat, particularly in the upper body, can be a major source of circulating free fatty acids in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Increased levels of free fatty acids are linked with insulin resistance and an imbalance of lipids in the blood, which can lead to the development of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Researchers from Boston University found that the correlation between neck circumference and increased risk of AFib persisted after taking into account traditional body fat measurements such as BMI, waist circumference, height and weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study out of Israel in 2019 presented similar findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The analysis included 302 patients with the average age being around 62 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the participants' height was accounted for, they found a high neck circumference 'significantly correlated with poor long-term outcome'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the complaints they found among the subjects with thicker necks included diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found the risk of these ailments was 2.3 times higher for those with larger neck circumferences compared to those with slimmer necks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And a 2022 study by researchers based out of Shanghai found that neck circumference was 'significantly associated' with the risk of future cardiovascular events in middle-aged and elderly populations and was a better predictor in men.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers enrolled 1,435 participants aged 50 to 80 years from communities in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A high neck circumference was defined as more than 15 inches in men and over 13 inches in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers employed various methods to explore the association between neck circumference and cardiovascular events. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a mean follow-up period of 7.6 years, 148 cardiovascular events occurred. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that for every one standard deviation increase in neck circumference, individuals in the study population were 1.45 times more likely to experience a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke compared to those with a lower neck circumference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers conclude that neck circumference is 'a new measurement index that is simple, saves time, has little variability, and can reflect upper-body fat content'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 17:07:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOR00zN1I2TTFvWENHMTduLWhLdU1HUWI2WjJOa01LMENzS3Z6azVHUkVyQjB1S0dzMGtld3ZEVWpTYS1HVkZmT2FSTUp4MWVlb3RGNGhJTnN4dVpuTDVSNjhxR1dPb2FFUV90cWFXZkwtdk84aktFRjlrWmNGYkpfaGJkZU5jRm5SZDlzLXVWZ0lBM0RSZENfeWp30gGfAUFVX3lxTE9wV3UwZS10YVBDcjRSbU1GbTd2dXJYQjRVeVlKMGZYNUtQVHN1dHBTWUZmelpyb3Z1REU0cmdyMkV2SUxSS004cUpoR0pjbG9aWVBIVTZ1QWMwcHV4UWxrZmVwcC0zT3FPOG5DZ0ViVTNYWTRnUzVKY1kyNjc1TVZsUnlma01uVk1nS2NiMlAwV2V6RmtRT0dueFlXUDVfTQ</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州宣布麻疹疫情结束-美联社新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNY01oaEJIajFzVlp5SmUxRkptWkNiQUt5c1hJNFF6NnpabkFMOVEya200ME85Vjk1VzlqdUNHQ216ajJwYW05QlVQTkV5cmx0YmRJTVBpbWdGcTZwY3NIeDZ2cW1qc3hQR1B0aTFMVDB4SXQwN3ZJUHVDM0NZNk94UDdRZHllWi1Semd4LXNPNTc3bG82UzR4dVh3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 16:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNY01oaEJIajFzVlp5SmUxRkptWkNiQUt5c1hJNFF6NnpabkFMOVEya200ME85Vjk1VzlqdUNHQ216ajJwYW05QlVQTkV5cmx0YmRJTVBpbWdGcTZwY3NIeDZ2cW1qc3hQR1B0aTFMVDB4SXQwN3ZJUHVDM0NZNk94UDdRZHllWi1Semd4LXNPNTc3bG82UzR4dVh3</guid></item><item><title>与慢性皮肤病变化脓性汗腺炎症状减轻相关的GLP-1药物- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPcXd4YUFJY3RIOHd0VGxla1NOZXY3V0lSOUw2WnJWN1F0dmc0ZzJ1NnVQaHJKVHlsRUZWNmZhSEtoZzhHWkFGUy1weEtKUHlxZHMtUUNuQ2ZnZ1RYQVFEOG1DeUM0d1YtdzM3XzJ6WFVjbkRuN3Z5cUYyMER6UnVmSnFfbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multicenter French study led by Rennes University Hospital reports potential benefits of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), with statistically significant reductions in HS-related scores at six months and at last follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;HS is a chronic skin condition that causes painful lumps and lesions in areas like the armpits, groin, and buttocks. Skin inflammation causes hair follicles to get blocked and the nearby sweat glands become inflamed, causing the lesions. The majority of HS patients are overweight or have obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctional adipose tissue contributes to the pathophysiology by overproducing proinflammatory adipokines and cytokines, while reducing anti-inflammatory adiponectin. Weight loss, through diet or obesity surgery, has a beneficial effect on HS in most patients. Meaningful reductions remain a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, originally developed for type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated major efficacy in inducing weight loss and could also possess anti-inflammatory properties, prompting investigation into their impact on HS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists in Hidradenitis Suppurativa," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2837172" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Dermatology&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study to assess the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on HS outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 66 patients with HS from 15 centers, median follow-up while taking GLP-1 receptor agonists was 18.5 months. Semaglutide was taken by 48 patients, dulaglutide by 13, and liraglutide by five. Adults with HS confirmed by a dermatologist who were receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for three months or longer were included. Outcomes were assessed at initiation, six months, and discontinuation or last consultation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The median age was 46.0 (37.5–54.0) years; 58% were women. The median BMI was 39.4 (32.9–45.0). Diabetes was present in 86%. Ongoing HS treatment at initiation occurred in 35 patients (53%), with &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antibiotic+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antibiotic therapy&lt;/a&gt; 23, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/broad-spectrum+antibiotics/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;broad-spectrum antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; three, and biologic nine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At six months, 54% of patients had a reduction in HS with 12% showing a 2-point or higher reduction based on the HS Physician's Global Assessment scale. By last consultation, 62% observed reductions, with 32% at or above the 2-point scale with flare reductions in 67% of patients, and decreased pain in 60%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Possible mechanisms for the results include a direct effect of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/weight+loss/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; and obesity-related low-grade systemic inflammation, an anti-inflammatory effect by lowering &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+cytokines/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory cytokines&lt;/a&gt; and attenuating Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammation in response to bacteria, with potential promotion of skin healing by reducing matrix metalloproteinases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors state that GLP-1 receptor agonists may offer promise for patients with HS and obesity and potentially for patients without obesity through immunological effects. Randomized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+trials/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; are needed to confirm the role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in HS management.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gwwz000h3b7an0ts5e4e@published"&gt;My husband died suddenly at age 71. We were married almost 40 years. He was retired and had a pension and social security, both of which went away when he died. Because of my own chronic health conditions, most of our financial planning imagined that I would die first and he would be financially secure. Man plans, God laughs. I am financially stable but must keep working to maintain my household.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gx4h000i3b7adxnnjycf@published"&gt;My husband has two living brothers. One is financially unstable with his own health issues. Throughout our marriage, we were able to throw some significant sums and the occasional emergency money his way. I continue to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="121" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gx65000j3b7alkldbwnj@published"&gt;The other brother seems fine but has had his own struggles. It seems that he had an expectation of an inheritance after my husband died. Is that a thing? If we had both died, there was a will that would have given each of his siblings and their children money. The day after my husband died, he and his family asked for his car. I said no, and traded in my 10 year-old car and his 11-year-old car for a new car for me. Now this family, who lives nearby, has distanced themselves from me and I only see them at the holiday gatherings. I don’t have warm fuzzy feeling for them now, but I’m wondering if I did something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m marveling at the gall of a brother who would ask a new, grieving widow for her husband’s car the day after his death. That’s some chutzpah.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="45" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gxrc000n3b7azogp0m0q@published"&gt;There’s a fair amount of ignorance about what happens when someone dies. For example, television shows have conditioned many people to believe there is an “estate reveal,” where loved ones or strangers come together to hear a reading of the will. That doesn’t often happen.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gxwl000o3b7awnlypuq7@published"&gt;If there is a will, the named executor will start the process of managing the estate, which may include filing the will with probate court, and finding all of the assets. Eventually, once any debts incurred by the estate are paid, the executor will distribute the assets to beneficiaries named in the will. The process can take months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gy1i000p3b7agniyjb2w@published"&gt;According to Caring.com’s &lt;a href="https://www.caring.com/resources/wills-survey"&gt;2025 survey&lt;/a&gt;, 76 percent of Americans don’t have a will. When someone dies intestate, or without a will, assets must be probated and a court decides who gets what, and manages the distribution of assets according to state law. If the decedent has minor children, then the court will decide who will have custody of those minor children and who will manage any assets left for their care.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="98" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gy64000q3b7a5s8nsblq@published"&gt;So, back to you. Did you do something wrong? Not from where I sit. In your case, your late husband has two living brothers, each of whom are struggling. While the one brother may have thought your late husband’s will left him something, asking for his car the day after he died makes me think he isn’t at all concerned about you. Telling him no was the easiest and best thing you could have done. The fact that they’ve essentially cut off ties indicates there perhaps wasn’t as much to the relationship as your husband may have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8gyas000r3b7a4nagsici@published"&gt;It’s kind of you to continue to support the other brother, although if you can’t afford it once you retire, you could walk that back a bit. Since you have been financially supporting him for a longer period, it would be thoughtful to give him some warning, so he can make other arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoo000w3b7arwp1buem@published"&gt;Near where I live, there’s a beautiful woodland area where I regularly walk my dogs. It’s a protected site, part of a former mining zone that’s now been reclaimed by nature. The terrain is unique and scenic—full of bumps, hills, small cliffs, and shaded by mature trees. According to local regulations, it’s off-limits to activities like motocross, which are both dangerous and disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoo000x3b7azkcgsfnd@published"&gt;Unfortunately, some local riders seem to ignore this. Despite complaints from residents, the local council has shown little interest in enforcement. So, I’ve taken a bit of initiative. Using fallen trees (brought down by storms or age—not cut by me), I’ve placed them across some of the popular trails. They’re always placed in visible spots, so as not to cause accidents, but the idea is to break up the speed and rhythm of motocross riders, discouraging them from using the trails altogether. Anecdotally, it seems to be working: the forest is much more peaceful now&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoo000y3b7a2cysx6xk@published"&gt;However, here’s my dilemma. These barriers also inconvenience other legitimate users of the forest—like mountain bikers and possibly even fellow walkers. While the trees can still be stepped over or climbed over (no athletic feats required), I acknowledge it creates a disruption. My wife thinks I should stop and restore the paths. I’m torn between trying to protect the forest’s character and peace, and respecting all users’ access.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="17" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihop00123b7afhyodtxo@published"&gt;I’m with your wife. Stop what you’re doing and return the trails to their former, natural state.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihop00133b7ayhmogq2m@published"&gt;I’m not an attorney, but you may be running afoul of several types of laws in the name of keeping the trails “peaceful.” If this is public land, placing obstacles on trails could constitute vandalism or interference with public property, even using “natural” materials. You might also be exposing yourself to a liability claim, if someone gets injured because of these barriers, which are intentionally placed. Many jurisdictions have specific laws against blocking trails or public pathways, regardless of good intentions. And finally, taking enforcement into your own hands when official authorities exist (even ineffective ones) can sometimes violate laws about interfering with governmental functions.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8itaz00193b7ap009fd93@published"&gt;You’re better off taking video or images of people who are misusing the trail and pressing the local council to regulate trails more actively. You might also approach, and offer to work with, local environmental groups about preserving the peaceful nature of the trail system. Can a system be developed where certain hours of specific days or weeks are reserved for motocross activities? Finally, can you work with the local authorities to put up better signage so that everyone knows the rules, regulations and fines that could be assessed?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh8ihoq00143b7aygyom01w@published"&gt;While the woodland area is clearly worth protecting, actively harming the trails in the name of protecting the environment could put you in serious legal jeopardy. Try to find another way to achieve the same, peaceful result.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="86" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeh7gke5000qxtkvtb0tjoun@published"&gt;I’ve decided to basically cut off my daughter once she’s finished with high school, which will be just over five months from now. She didn’t do anything wrong, I’m not eager to be rid of her, and I could easily continue to provide for her basic needs, but I won’t. I myself lived with my parents into my 20s, but I feel like this did me no favors, and I’ve come to believe in “sink or swim” and “hard knock” life philosophies. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2023/01/cutting-off-daughter-personal-finance-advice.html"&gt;So please don’t argue about this decision.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These sickly squirrels aren’t zombies, however, but victims of a real viral disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Residents in both &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/article/what-is-squirrelpox-and-should-canadians-be-concerned/"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/05/15/homestead/squirrel-pox-maine-joam40zk0w/"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; have recently reported sightings of the zombie squirrels, dating back to at least 2023. These animals are likely carrying a germ known as the squirrel fibroma virus (SFV). Though the condition is scary-looking, squirrels usually recover from the infection, and it poses no threat to humans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SFV was first &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/13037878/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in the 1950s and is a poxvirus, meaning it’s related to the virus that causes smallpox in humans. That said, it’s a part of a genus, leporipoxvirus, whose only &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/leporipoxvirus#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20evidence%20that%20leporipoxviruses%20are%20zoonotic%2C%20but%20myxoma%20virus%20exhibits%20tropism%20for%20tumor%20cells%20from%20outside%20the%20rabbit%20species."&gt;known natural hosts&lt;/a&gt; are squirrels and rabbits. The infection causes benign tumors, or fibromas, to form across the squirrel’s skin, particularly on its head or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;

It predominantly affects gray squirrels, though it can infect &lt;a href="https://ilacadofsci.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/108-07MS991Final.pdf"&gt;other species&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SFV can be a dangerous disease for squirrels. The tumors can potentially metastasize to the animal’s internal organs or become so large and numerous on the skin that they cause secondary infections or even hamper the animal’s vision and ability to eat. But according to the &lt;a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/managing-resources/wildlife/wildlife-disease/wdm/squirrel-pox"&gt;Michigan Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;, the infection typically doesn’t cause any obvious signs of illness outside of the skin fibromas. And in areas where it is common, like Michigan, the virus hasn’t had any effect on the overall squirrel population. In &lt;a href="https://cwhl.vet.cornell.edu/disease/fibromas"&gt;most cases&lt;/a&gt;, the fibromas regress over time, and the animal recovers completely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a hunter with a hankering for squirrel meat, you can also rest easy. Even SFV-infected squirrels are apparently safe for consumption, according to the Michigan DNR. Still, the average person shouldn’t try to touch or handle infected squirrels, or really any wildlife for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;On a little side note, SFV is sometimes called the squirrel pox virus. But this is also the nickname for a different pox virus (the &lt;a href="https://ictv.global/report/chapter/poxviridae/poxviridae/sciuripoxvirus"&gt;squirrelpox virus&lt;/a&gt;) that predominantly affects squirrels in the UK. Adding to the confusion, researchers have &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23307385/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5621524/"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; potential squirrel pox viruses in countries like Canada and Germany. All of which is to say: It feels like there should be a cleaner labeling system for these squirrel-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

Immunization Dashboard reports 93% of kindergarteners statewide were up to date
on required vaccines, &lt;a href="https://www.dph.ncdhhs.gov/programs/epidemiology/immunization/data/kindergarten-dashboard"&gt;as
of the most recent data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The interactive dashboard enables parents to narrow immunization
data searches by county, and specific school.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Orange County has the highest compliance rate in central North Carolina at 97%. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Durham County has the lowest compliance rate in central North Carolina at 88%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wake County and Johnston County are listed at 94%, with Chatham County at 95%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Herd immunity, the point where enough people in a population
have achieved immunity against a virus from vaccination or prior exposure to make
it difficult for a disease to spread, varies based on the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19"&gt;World
Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; states measles requires a herd immunity of 95% to reduce
the likelihood of an outbreak. NIH studies show &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10458369/"&gt;rubella requires a
lower percentage&lt;/a&gt; of about 80-85%. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tony Moody, a pediatric infectious disease specialist who
sees patients with Duke Health, said Durham County’s low numbers are
surprising. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Durham County is lower than I would’ve expected, given it’s
a very medically savvy community,” stated Moody. “It’s a little shocking to see
kindergarten readiness is lower than you would’ve expect, and teenagers are not
as well-vaccinated as you would expect.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor explained there are several factors behind why vaccinations
are lagging, including pandemic-related disruptions, and the age of the child
in question. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We obviously took a hit with the pandemic, and it was a
reasonable hit,” said Moody. “I’m not shocked we had that dip, but we have not
recovered to the extent that I would’ve hoped.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He further noted older children have historically been more
likely to miss a scheduled vaccination or fail to complete a vaccination series
on time. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“As you get into the older age ranges, and really we’re
talking about vaccines given between 9-15 years of age, they’re lower than they
are for younger children,” said Moody. “A lot of times, they’ll catch up or get
some of those vaccines as they’re heading off into college or go off into the
military.”

&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;What vaccines are the most urgent to schedule my child
for?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Topping the list of the most urgent vaccinations North
Carolina children need to be up to date on is MMR for measles, Moody advised. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We see that &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/triangle-hospitals-alert-measles-case-nc-june-2025/"&gt;measles is out there&lt;/a&gt;. We obviously have the
huge out breaks in Texas, we’ve had pockets across the country, there’s a huge
outbreak going on in Canada right now – and we’re just a plane ride away from everywhere,”
warned Moody. “It is so contagious it could just rip through a school before
you’ve had any opportunity to contain it.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;One dose of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is
93% effective against measles, 72% effective against mumps and 97% effective
against rubella, according to the CDC. Completing the two-dose series bumps protection
for measles up to 97% and 86% for mumps.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody says parents should also prioritize these vaccinations,
among others recommended by the CDC, in their child’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/by-age/index.html"&gt;first few years of life&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Haemophilus influenzae (Hib)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody also recommended starting the four-dose series of the pneumococcal
(PCV) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In teens and preteens, the pediatrician advises vaccinations
for meningococcal and human papillomavirus (HPV). &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;

Does my child need a COVID or flu vaccine right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When it comes to a recommendation for an annual flu and
COVID shot, Moody said he strongly believes they are effective in reducing
serious illness. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;However, the pediatrician argued that being up to date on
MMR should be a higher priority for families at the current moment. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If the decision is going to be to get the MMR and get good
immunity to that, and something else, I’m going to get the MMR. That’s the
thing that really could become a public health disaster,” he stated.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;
Why schedule an appointment for my child now?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Returning to the classroom can be a prime time for illnesses
to spread, especially among children who are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Immunity can take a few weeks to build, so pediatricians
urge parents to get children up to date now, before respiratory viruses surge
in late fall and winter.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we know is when you bring people together
who have not been together recently, they essentially swap bugs,” Moody said. “We
are all carrying around things, we are all shedding things, and we know when we
bring people together, they will start swapping things around. Any of the susceptible
individuals can potentially come down with it and get sick.”

&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;h2&gt;How do I know the recommended vaccines are safe for my
child?&lt;/h2&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Talk to your pediatrician,” Moody simply replied when asked
the same question by WRAL.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician offered his own services, &lt;a href="https://www.dukehealth.org/treatments/infectious-diseases"&gt;encouraging
people to call him with their questions&lt;/a&gt; or contact other reputable infectious
disease experts working locally within local health systems. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor also warned of misinformation online and advised
parents to take their questions directly to their licensed family doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked how he navigates conversations about
misinformation with parents, Moody stated, “I think it’s tough. We have to get
better at saying, ‘Here’s what the truth is and here’s what the data show.'”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He continued, “Nobody is making these decisions because they
think they’re making the wrong decision. Part of what I would try to do is talk to them
about actual risks and actual benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Using MMR as an example, Moody shared he would explain to
parents and patients, “If you’re susceptible to measles and you get it, there’s
about a 20% chance of going into the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;He continued, “When you’re talking about the vaccine, there
are people who can have reactions to it, and a very small number of people who
can have a fever.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/durham-county-lowest-vaccine-rates-central-nc-august-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Severe complications from the MMR vaccine are “exceedingly
rare,” the physician stated. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines don’t make money, that’s just the truth,” Moody
noted. “We’re doing it because we don’t want to see these kids going to the
hospital. We don’t want to see these kids with the long-term complications that
we know can come up from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody also added he encourages those with vaccination concerns
based on religious beliefs to get involved in local scientific research efforts to find
new ways to protect against infectious diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“These things are done the way they are done because that’s
how we did them in the past, but it doesn’t mean we can’t do them a different way,”
said Moody. “Help me find a better way to do it. That’s what we want as scientists
is to find better ways of doing things.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Moody shared the &lt;a href="https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/immunizations/vaccination-recommendations-by-the-aap/?srsltid=AfmBOoruybEhJU8xPZI4Yn3p6NsOr5sdGW4sKOnUgLJmcJjAUXLWry6T"&gt;American
Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pids.org/"&gt;Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society&lt;/a&gt; are good sources for trusted catch-up vaccine information
and data for interested parents.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

            

&lt;p&gt;Mosquito season is in full swing in Europe, and with it, mosquito-borne virus season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 470 cases of West Nile virus, chikungunya, and dengue have been reported so far this year, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/communicable-disease-threats-report-week-33-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(ECDC)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks cases in the European Union and a few other countries in the region.&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;These viral diseases, which usually occur when an infected mosquito bites someone, are becoming more common in Europe due to increased travel and warmer summer temperatures driven by climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about these illnesses and where cases have been detected so far this summer, as of mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;West Nile virus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/surveillance-and-disease-data/disease-data-ecdc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight European countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported West Nile virus infections this year: Italy (274), Greece (35), Serbia (nine), Romania (six), France (four), Hungary (two), Spain (one) and Bulgaria (one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those counts include both probable and confirmed cases in people. &lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;p&gt;Most cases so far this year have been among men aged 65 and older, and most people have been hospitalised. At least &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/08/02/ten-deaths-reported-from-west-nile-virus-in-italy-since-the-start-of-the-year"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10 people in Italy have died&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from West Nile virus in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 150 people who are infected with the virus will develop severe illness, such as encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, or meningitis, which is inflammation of the protective membranes around the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These complications can be fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chikungunya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has reported 111 chikungunya cases this summer, amid an uptick in cases in recent weeks. There have been 22 clusters of chikungunya infections this summer, and 16 are still active.&lt;/p&gt;  



&lt;p&gt;Italy, meanwhile, has recorded seven cases of chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya is not endemic in the EU mainland, but warmer weather during the summer months make it easier for mosquitoes to spread the virus. Most cases are typically reported in July or August, the ECDC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two chikungunya vaccines approved in the EU, but there are no specific treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya can cause fever, nausea, headache, fatigue, rash, muscle aches, joint swelling, and joint pain, which can be debilitating and long-lasting. Severe symptoms and death are rare consequences, though babies and older adults are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dengue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France has seen 11 dengue cases this year, while Italy has seen four and Portugal has reported two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU health authorities believe the Portuguese infections, which were reported in Madeira in January, were likely contracted last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECDC said one type of mosquito that spreads dengue has been “established in a large part of Europe” and that another is fairly common around Madeira, Cyprus, and the Black Sea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Globally, there are 100 million to 400 million dengue infections per year, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people who are infected with dengue have no or mild symptoms, but the virus can cause fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and a rash. In extreme cases, dengue can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specific medication to treat dengue, and the best way to avoid infection is to take steps to prevent mosquito bites.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

But not everyone wants to wear prescription glasses or contact lenses. Accordingly, hundreds of thousands of people undergo corrective eye surgery each year, including LASIK -- a laser-assisted surgery that reshapes the cornea and corrects vision. The procedure can result in negative side effects, prompting researchers to take the laser out of LASIK by remodeling the cornea, rather than cutting it, in initial animal tissue tests.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, will present his team's results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS). ACS Fall 2025 is being held Aug. 17-21; it features about 9,000 presentations on a range of science topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human corneas are dome-shaped, clear structures that sit at the front of the eye, bending light from surroundings and focusing it onto the retina, where it's sent to the brain and interpreted as an image. But if the cornea is misshapen, it doesn't focus light properly, resulting in a blurry image. With LASIK, specialized lasers reshape the cornea by removing precise sections of the tissue. This common procedure is considered safe, but it has some limitations and risks, and cutting the cornea compromises the structural integrity of the eye. Hill explains that "LASIK is just a fancy way of doing traditional surgery. It's still carving tissue -- it's just carving with a laser."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the cornea could be reshaped without the need for any incisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Hill and collaborator Brian Wong are exploring through a process known as electromechanical reshaping (EMR). "The whole effect was discovered by accident," explains Wong, a professor and surgeon at the University of California, Irvine. "I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the body, the shapes of many collagen-containing tissues, including corneas, are held in place by attractions of oppositely charged components. These tissues contain a lot of water, so applying an electric potential to them lowers the tissue's pH, making it more acidic. By altering the pH, the rigid attractions within the tissue are loosened and make the shape malleable. When the original pH is restored, the tissue is locked into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, the researchers used EMR to reshape cartilage-rich rabbit ears, as well as alter scars and skin in pigs. But one collagen-rich tissue that they were eager to explore was the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the team constructed specialized, platinum "contact lenses" that provided a template for the corrected shape of the cornea, then placed each over a rabbit eyeball in a saline solution meant to mimic natural tears. The platinum lens acted as an electrode to generate a precise pH change when the researchers applied a small electric potential to the lens. After about a minute, the cornea's curvature conformed to the shape of the lens -- about the same amount of time LASIK takes, but with fewer steps, less expensive equipment and no incisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They repeated this setup on 12 separate rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. In all the "myopic" eyeballs, the treatment dialed in the targeted focusing power of the eye, which would correspond to improved vision. The cells in the eyeball survived the treatment, because the researchers carefully controlled the pH gradient. Additionally, in other experiments, the team demonstrated that their technique might be able to reverse some chemical-caused cloudiness to the cornea -- a condition that is currently only treatable through a complete corneal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this initial work is promising, the researchers emphasize that it is in its very early stages. Next up is what Wong describes as, "the long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise," including tests on a living rabbit rather than just its eyeball. They also plan to determine the types of vision correction possible with EMR, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism. Though the next steps are planned, uncertainties in the team's scientific funding have put them on hold. "There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible," concludes Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Title&lt;/strong&gt; Electrochemical corneal refraction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt; The cornea is a transparent, highly organized anatomical structure that is responsible for ~2/3 of the refractive power of the eye. The corneal stroma consists of orthogonally stacked collagen- fibril lamellae whose molecular composition and precise macromolecular geometry eliminate backscattered light and maintain the shape of the cornea. Anatomical variation, birth defects, trauma, and various pathologies can alter the shape, structural stability, and transparency of the cornea, thus affecting vision. Surgical interventions to treat myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism include laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). Despite their popularity, these procedures are expensive and permanently lower the biomechanical strength of the cornea. Here we report our efforts to apply electromechanical reshaping (EMR) as a molecular- based, non-ablative/non-incisional alternative to laser vision refraction, using ex vivo rabbit globes. EMR relies on short electrochemical pulses to electrolyze interstitial water, with subsequent diffusion of protons into the extracellular matrix of collagenous tissues; protonation of immobilized anions within this matrix disrupts the ionic-bonding network that provides structural integrity. This leaves the tissue transiently responsive to mechanical remodeling; subsequent re-equilibration to physiological pH restores the ionic matrix, resulting in persistent shape change of the tissue. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), second-harmonic generation (SHG), and confocal microscopy suggest that EMR enables control over corneal contouring while maintaining the underlying macromolecular collagen structure and stromal cellular viability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This research was funded by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health and the John Stauffer Charitable Trust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

delved into the “Make America healthy again” (Maha) movement, a “big tent” group that’s “not just Republicans”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Many within the loose Maha movement are parents interested in feeding their children healthy food. “People have found themselves in Maha for all sorts of reasons, and there are areas where it has legitimate concerns,” Oliver said on Sunday evening. He pointed to numerous former episodes that overlapped with Maha concerns, from plastic to sugar to biases in medicine, and confirmed that experts agree with health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr’s central claim that American children are getting sicker; a child in the US is 15% to 20% more likely to have a chronic condition in 2023 than in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/series/john-oliver-recap","type":"Series","title":"John Oliver recap"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/john-oliver","type":"Keyword","title":"John Oliver"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","type":"Keyword","title":"Television &amp;amp; radio"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/comedy","type":"Keyword","title":"TV comedy"},{"id":"culture/television","type":"Keyword","title":"Television"},{"id":"culture/culture","type":"Keyword","title":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/comedy","type":"Keyword","title":"Comedy"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-arts-and-culture","type":"Tracking","title":"US Arts and Culture"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"tv-and-radio/2025/aug/18/john-oliver-make-america-healthy-again","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="61460da0-d3a7-4885-8038-bc605d2f390a" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.VideoYoutubeBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“So for some, especially experts in diet and nutrition, suddenly seeing the Maha movement bring attention to issues they’re passionate about has been validating if also bittersweet,” said Oliver before a clip of renowned nutritionist Dr Marion Nestle admit that seeing Kennedy appointed health and human services secretary was “the first time I’ve heard anybody at that level of government talk about these things … I can’t get over it. And it’s hard to put that together with some of the other things he’s saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; bizarre to have someone you virulently disagree with in most respects echo your opinions in another,” Oliver confirmed. “It would be like if Kim Jong-un came out and said, ‘Wirecutter has too many articles now, and if you’re looking at Wirecutter for like ketchup, you need to reassess how you make decisions.’ It would be weird.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4a879e14-35a1-409a-8ffc-1868fcdb1511" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":5,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"John Oliver on Ice’s crackdown: ‘Trying to drive up arrests at all costs’","elementId":"4a879e14-35a1-409a-8ffc-1868fcdb1511","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/11/john-oliver-trump-ice-immigration"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":3}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unfortunately, some of ‘the other things’ RFK is saying could now have massive consequences given the position that he’s in,” he continued. “Because even when he and his movement can be right about identifying a problem, their solutions can range from the superficial to the outright dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Oliver punctured some of the movement’s claimed victories, such as the banning of certain artificial food dyes. Given that there is literature to support that synthetic food dyes can impact neurobehavior in some children, and the fact that there is no real need for them, Oliver didn’t oppose removing dyes from foods. But experts say such moves “won’t actually move the needle” when it comes to Americans’ health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Making a big deal out of narrow wins is part and parcel of this movement,” he explained, pointing to the influencer and Kennedy acolyte Vani Hari, also known as the Food Babe, who markets her own line of protein shakes in videos calling out obscure ingredients in normal milkshakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You might be thinking, well, who cares if some of Maha’s boosters can be wobbly on the science or are hawking products, as long as RFK Jr is putting reliable people in charge at the top,” said Oliver. “But I’d argue he isn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The host then looked at the brother and sister duo of Calley and Casey Means, top advisers for RFK Jr. The former claimed on the Joe Rogan podcast that he convinced Kennedy to join Trump’s campaign after a revelatory meeting at a sweat tent. “I would rather be anywhere on earth than in a sweat tent with RFK,” Oliver joked. “I’d rather be in a dumpster full of glass and cockroaches. I’d rather be in a flight where half the passengers are babies and half are Mel Gibsons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Oliver also mocked a Casey Means podcast appearance in which she drank a “liver smoothie” and winced. “I think we as a society have collectively lost our grasp of what smoothies are supposed to be,” he said. “Because there should not be meat in there, as that is definitionally no longer a smoothie. It’s hospital food for a terminally ill hyena.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Both Meanses promote the idea of “metabolic health” or, to quote their book, “Good Energy”, to the point that Calley Means said that cancer, dementia, and genetic diseases are not random, but “all tied essentially to food”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t think it’s quite that simple,” said Oliver. “Most medical experts will tell you that it’s not that health outcomes can’t be impacted by personal behaviors or diet, but health is complex, and its components are personal, environmental and systemic, on top of which sometimes – and this is a technical term – shit just happens, and it’s out of your control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While the Meanses come down hard on processed foods, there are other areas where they are “worryingly lax”, said Oliver. Casey doesn’t favor restrictions on selling raw milk, which can contain carry dangerous pathogens such as salmonella, E coli and listeria, and has entertained bogus ideas on vaccines causing autism. Calley Means said on Rogan’s podcast that “if you were metabolically healthy, you did not die of Covid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If one is to take the Meanses at their word, they just want Americans to eat healthier, but their work with Kennedy is not accomplishing that goal. The new administration has cut $1bn in federal funding for schools and food banks to buy food from local suppliers, and its made cuts to Snap food assistance eligibility, meaning there are fewer recipients of free breakfast and lunch at school. “Which I guess is one way to accomplish Maha’s goals – kids can’t eat any food dyes if they’re not eating anything,” said Oliver. “And that is the thing: whatever cosmetic gain Maha has won since Trump took office have been more than offset in massive losses elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ae6f3979-bbcd-4676-99c0-a25004738a01" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"John Oliver: ‘Gaza is being starved by Israel’","elementId":"ae6f3979-bbcd-4676-99c0-a25004738a01","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/04/john-oliver-gaza-starvation"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":3}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Oliver also looked ahead to potentially even worse losses ahead. The Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy has already begun scaling back and defunding mRNA vaccine research, in what one public health expert called “the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen made by a government body”. And in June, Kennedy fired everyone from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which decides on immunization standards. He has since appointed seven new members, only one of whom is recognized as a vaccine expert, the rest being, as Oliver put it, “a real who’s-uh-oh of crackpots”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is a bleak time to be involved in public health,” he summarized, as the administration is “taking a buzzsaw to so many of Maha’s stated priorities”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is maddening that for the first time in recent memory, there’s been a genuine groundswell of support for a cleaner, healthier, less corporately controlled America, but it’s taken this fucking form,” he added. “Because for the final time: it is absolutely legitimate to want Americans to be healthier, and there are clearly legitimate problems when it comes to America’s health. But these just aren’t the solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Instead, the administration is “shredding the social safety net”, said Oliver, while “elevating voices that push the responsibility for healthcare down to the individual”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“In its current form, Maha is not about making America healthy again,” he concluded. “At best, it is about laundering the reputation of an administration that is doing the exact opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQb3J2V0lqX2xVMUlBdWgyWFB1eWNyTzQ2UVF5aU43VTNKTW1rNW9CYmNmazktUUVnZlJKT0x4WUczQkM5TjNnaVNERTRvR09QekpqdGRGV1pYSUdMNXJfSTA4cFJvN3hFWmJhSlktT1ZCdXhWNkROd1RaaDVXRDR5cW05c3g0Q3R1NS1hWWZZQ01iYkJhcXc</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，减少一种食物类型可以使体重减轻近一倍- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1tLXh0QjIxNkpBS3lqQ0daMUxWQXN4WjNVek1BVnBoUm5xQ0xrdkVmVmtEdXJZVkhYWXhBN25WNU9GZXRqaGhBV3MwY296MDdrZTl3c2YzcWtRMFQzWVRGVHh0a25vb25GR0s0QU04QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that cutting out a single category of foods could nearly double people's &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nutrition-and-fitness/weight-loss" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight-loss results.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;weight-loss results.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal Nature Medicine on Aug. 4, found that overweight adults who ditched &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ultra-processed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; (UPFs) lost nearly twice as much weight over a two-month span as those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs include microwave meals, sodas, potato chips and packaged cookies, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/5-everyday-foods-drinks-damaging-long-term-health-nutrition-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:5 Everyday Foods And Drinks Silently Damaging Your Long-term Health, Say Nutrition Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 Everyday Foods And Drinks Silently Damaging Your Long-term Health, Say Nutrition Experts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they can also include items marketed as &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/healthy-foods" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:"health foods,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;"health foods,"&lt;/a&gt; some medical professionals say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPFs go through multiple processes to be "stabilized for consumption," Dr. Jeffrey Kraft, a bariatric surgeon at Hackensack Meridian Palisades Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A new study found that cutting out ultra-processed foods from the diet may accelerate weight loss.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Processed foods are not natural foods," he said.

In fact, 37% of Americans say they can tell how their day will go within the first 10 minutes of waking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what else we uncovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;1 in 3 Americans have morning thrown off by change in routine. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It doesn’t take much to throw off a morning. Whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/perk-up-without-caffeine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:forgetting to brew coffee;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;forgetting to brew coffee&lt;/a&gt;, skipping a shower, or neglecting to drink water, these seemingly minor slip-ups can have a major impact. Here’s what people said were the biggest morning disruptors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reasons why mornings get thrown off. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does skipping part of your morning routine affect your whole day? Because routines provide structure, predictability and control, all of which help you mentally and physically prepare for the day ahead. When that structure is disrupted, on the other hand, your brain registers it as a break in rhythm, which can lead to feeling rushed and scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Reasons why mornings get thrown off. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why does skipping part of your morning routine affect your whole day? Because routines provide structure, predictability, and control, all of which help you mentally and physically prepare for the day ahead. When that structure is disrupted, on the other hand, your brain registers it as a break in rhythm, which can lead to feeling rushed and scattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So What Happens When You Wake Up on the Wrong Side of the Bed?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer? A bad day. Half of Americans say they can tell how their entire day will go based on how they feel right after waking up. Younger generations are especially attuned to this connection, with 67% of Gen Z and 58% of millennials linking a rough morning to a rough day ahead. The takeaway? How you start your day matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Generational perception of how mornings affect days. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most people don’t just feel the impact of a bad morning, they recognize it. In fact, over 60% said they could likely trace a rough day back to how it started. When you know, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Percentages of respondents that can identify a bad day was caused by a bad morning. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;But why does a bad morning lead to a bad day? One possible explanation is that the first hour of your day shapes your mindset, stress levels, and energy. Thus, when you wake up feeling tired, rushed, or out of sync, it can trigger a cascade of negative emotions and decision fatigue that together make it harder to stay focused, patient, or productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can You Turn a Rough Morning Around?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the morning goes sideways, most people have a go-to fix. For some, it’s a solid breakfast. For others, it’s as simple as stepping outside for fresh air or sipping more water alongside that first cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the data, these are the top things people do to turn a rough morning around:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Eating breakfast early in the day (49%)&lt;br&gt;• Getting fresh air (46%)&lt;br&gt;• Drinking as much water as coffee or tea (42%)&lt;br&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/meditation-cushions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stretching;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Stretching&lt;/a&gt; (35%)&lt;br&gt;• Taking a lukewarm or cool shower (27%)&lt;br&gt;• Exercising before going to work (24%)&lt;br&gt;• Spending less than 10 minutes scrolling on a phone (21%)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Top seven things to do in the morning to boost your day. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regardless of gender, the top three ways to improve a morning were the same:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Eating an early breakfast&lt;br&gt;2. Getting fresh air&lt;br&gt;3. Drinking just as much water as coffee or tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These simple habits stood out across the board as the most effective ways to reset and reclaim the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Responses to question - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;While it's helpful to know how to bounce back from a rough start, the best mornings are the ones that don’t need fixing. That’s where routine comes in. On average, it takes about 25 minutes to feel fully awake. Millennials take the longest, with a 29-minute gap between waking up and feeling awake, while the Silent Generation needs only 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Time spent waking up in minutes, by generation. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s no surprise, then, that most people build a morning routine that lasts around 30 minutes — just enough time to fully wake up and move through the habits that help them feel ready for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to our findings, these are the most common ways people start their mornings on the right foot:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Brushing their teeth (65%)&lt;br&gt;• Drinking water (60%)&lt;br&gt;• Making fresh coffee and tea (51%)&lt;br&gt;• Clearing their eyes (48%)&lt;br&gt;• Scrolling through missed notifications (40%)&lt;br&gt;• Stretching (38%)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graph showing tasks that comprise a typical morning routine. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;But What If a Great Morning Starts the Night Before?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as people focus on what happens after the alarm goes off, the truth is, better mornings often begin long before that. In fact, most (68%) agree that a good night of sleep is the real secret to a good day — and the data backs it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Cycle showing the relationship between a good night of sleep and having a good day. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sleep well, wake well, live better. It’s a cycle worth getting right. Most adults (75%) believe their day would be better if they got the perfect amount of sleep. This is especially true for Gen Zers, with 80% of respondents born between the years 1997 and 2012 believing that getting the perfect amount of sleep leads to a better day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Percentage of people who believe their day would be better with better sleep, by generation. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;We all know what the perfect night of sleep feels like, but how many of us are actually getting it? When we asked people to compare how much sleep they typically get versus how much they wish they got, the gap was impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority report sleeping between four and six hours a night, even though 80% say their ideal would be seven to nine hours. And while 72% believe hitting that sweet spot would make their day better, only 47% are actually doing it. The struggle for better sleep? Very real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Opinions on getting the perfect amount of sleep. - Naturepedic&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;How to Give Yourself the Best Chance at Rest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the path to better mornings starts the night before, the path to better sleep starts before your head hits the pillow. Many people rely on small, familiar habits to help them &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/blog/healthy-bedtime-routine" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wind down;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;wind down&lt;/a&gt; — watching TV, reading, pouring a glass of water, or &lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/lifestyle/bed-pro-step-step-guide-150005165.html" data-ylk="slk:putting fresh bedding on the bed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;putting fresh bedding on the bed&lt;/a&gt;.

Better Days Begin With Better Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the first few minutes after waking up to the small habits we rely on before bed, one theme is clear: how we structure our routines matters. A consistent morning sets the tone for the day, but real energy, focus, and resilience start the night before — with enough rest, the right habits, and a space (&lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/adult/mattresses" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mattress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mattress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/np/adult-bedding" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:bedding;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;bedding&lt;/a&gt; included) that supports deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because when you sleep better, you live better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;TL;DR: Quick Answers to Your Morning Routine Questions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long does it take to feel fully awake in the morning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On average, it takes about 25 minutes to fully wake up in the morning (though it varies slightly by generation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long should a morning routine be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A morning routine should be about 30 minutes long. That’s the average across all age groups and matches the time most people need to fully wake up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to improve a bad morning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eating breakfast early, getting fresh air, and drinking water are the top three things people do to improve a bad morning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can a bad morning really ruin your day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. 49% of people say their morning plays a major role in how the rest of the day goes, and 37% can tell within 10 minutes how their day will unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does better sleep lead to a better day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolutely. 70% of people believe that a good night of sleep improves their day, and 68% of people believe a good day improves their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What helps people fall asleep and stay asleep?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Top bedtime habits for better sleep include watching TV, reading, drinking a glass of water, using fresh sheets, and limiting screen time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.naturepedic.com/healthy-morning-habits" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://naturepedic.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Naturepedic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naturepedic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:07:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE9BMW81OFliQjM3UW5ZRFJIY0psRTVPQnRtbnpXU01QbTlfVWNfMDNPQ1l4ZHJmZDZUWkM0M2lNaTZoOTdEMHhWSlhsZ2tES01ORzBpVEdEdkRpcmFHZllPQmZ5eWNsb3g4N1E</guid></item><item><title>“我的癌症症状被误认为是更年期的迹象–现在我无法行走” -《独立报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVTlJZ01ZTHJTaGJGQXRXZ1h0cmp5UTQxTzlOMjl0aE5iVnlMLWFZSUFwbTVjRW5TTlFhNmlhaWh0RlhHZFRSekx6QXpzam4xYmRoZUppaWxCcTRHRk9sLURZUFRqd1R2LTBNMmJKSVBhcHl1NXhRVjBjSEhzd1dWR1d6NjY3TVFUaUo0dzY3VExwVGZ0TFNPNEhySQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

However, she was told the back pain was due to gardening,&lt;/a&gt; despite having only done 20 minutes of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two months, her symptoms worsened and she stopped eating properly, lost weight, and developed a temperature, later losing all sensation in her legs and as well as bladder and bowel function. After being taken to the hospital and admitted for two weeks, she was given the devastating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;news that she had stage four non-Hodgkin lymphoma in her kidneys, and a tumour wrapped around her spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one round of radiotherapy and further chemotherapy, she is now in remission. However, she has been left unable to walk and is now a full-time wheelchair user. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “life-changing” impacts of the cancer have meant she has to reduce her working hours to four a week, while her husband has given up work to be a full-time carer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-right"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dZfcjv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/50/1092bef4-6281-4a84-be95-1403ffe828e0.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Karen Davey, 54, is now in remission after being treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-14146"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Karen Davey, 54, is now in remission after being treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Spinal Injuries Association)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Davey told the Spinal Injuries Association she felt her symptoms were “dismissed” by her GP and continued to be dismissed until she was admitted to hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: “I’d gone from somebody who was quite active before. I’d do a lot of hiking across the moors, I used to go cold water swimming all year round. One of the last things I did before I got ill was an abseil off a 120-foot viaduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t what I’m supposed to be doing at this time of life. I’ve not yet been able to get back to driving or anything like that. I’m completely reliant on my husband; it’s messed up my social life, just going out to meet friends or going swimming or popping into town to look around the shops. Emotionally, it’s just completely messed me up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Davey said she wanted to spread awareness of her situation and help others who might be experiencing similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 PzkRY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-14147"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Spinal Injuries Association)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said, “I had no idea that hot flushes would lead to all this. The symptoms you’ve got aren’t always menopause symptoms, and we need to be more mindful of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just get annoyed that it was attributed to menopause and doing gardening when it needed looking into a bit more. I didn’t know anything about &lt;a href="/topic/spinal-cord-injury"&gt;spinal cord injury&lt;/a&gt; and when my toes started going tingly, it didn’t occur to me that that’s what it was.

Dharshana Sridhar, campaigns manager at Spinal Injuries Association, said, “Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that women’s health symptoms should never be dismissed or explained away without proper investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Too often, women with spinal cord injuries face delays in diagnosis and unnecessary barriers to equitable care, leaving them to cope with life-changing consequences that could have been prevented. Across the board, women’s concerns are frequently overlooked and when disability or other intersecting factors are involved, the barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment become even greater. Through our women’s health campaign, we’re calling for better awareness, earlier diagnosis, and accessible healthcare for every woman, no matter her disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVTlJZ01ZTHJTaGJGQXRXZ1h0cmp5UTQxTzlOMjl0aE5iVnlMLWFZSUFwbTVjRW5TTlFhNmlhaWh0RlhHZFRSekx6QXpzam4xYmRoZUppaWxCcTRHRk9sLURZUFRqd1R2LTBNMmJKSVBhcHl1NXhRVjBjSEhzd1dWR1d6NjY3TVFUaUo0dzY3VExwVGZ0TFNPNEhySQ</guid></item><item><title>您是否“过于敏感” ？科学说它可能会影响你的心理健康-研究发现</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNZGdqeExkeE5lWVBCSzkzbU1yYnRNelpLUnFNOGg1RlE2MUJkQ2dmNTVrTWt3eGNCZXp6S1RoTDBfSmREeXJhM0p2bVVEa1RiVU4zWVlrdUtabU9LeXVsdVVmN3V3RERZZXdwTVNrVXNWQWlxNmF6X3dDRDJhdFpmR3FRWkZhSDNlZno2eEc4TQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="" alt="Man crying, battling depression or anxiety" data-lazy-src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Depression-1200x800.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Depression-1200x800.jpg" alt="Man crying, battling depression or anxiety"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;Highly sensitive people are at greater risk for numerous mental health conditions.

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About one in three people are “highly sensitive,” meaning they feel sights, sounds, and emotions more deeply than others.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A review of 33 studies with nearly 13,000 people found that higher sensitivity is linked to more symptoms of anxiety and depression.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers say sensitivity is not a disorder, but it may shape how people experience mental health and should be considered more in treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LONDON —&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly one-third of people possess a personality trait that is linked with depression and anxiety symptoms, yet it’s often overlooked in treatment. A new systematic review and meta-analysis of existing studies reveals that “highly sensitive” people tend to show moderate associations with mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed 33 studies involving more than 12,000 people and found consistent positive connections between heightened environmental sensitivity and common mental health disorders. They argue that sensitivity represents a measurable trait that may matter for &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;psychological well-being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Led by scientists from Queen Mary University of London, the research shows moderate links with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/ocd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;obsessive-compulsive disorder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;post-traumatic stress disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and social phobia. The connection was similar in strength for both depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-signs-you-may-be-a-highly-sensitive-person"&gt;Signs You May Be a Highly Sensitive Person&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Environmental sensitivity describes people who process sensory information more deeply and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/highly-sensitive-people-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;react more strongly&lt;/a&gt; to their surroundings. These individuals often notice subtle environmental changes, feel overwhelmed in busy environments, and experience intense emotional responses to both positive and negative situations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This trait exists on a spectrum. About 29% of people show low sensitivity, 40% show medium sensitivity, and 31% display high sensitivity, according to previous research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists measure this trait using questionnaires that include questions such as &lt;em&gt;“Are you more than others affected by moods of other people?”&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;“Do you become unpleasantly aroused when a lot is going on around you?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The concept traces back to Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who described “innate sensitiveness” in 1913, but systematic research only began in the 1990s. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-scans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brain imaging studies&lt;/a&gt; have revealed heightened activity in regions associated with empathy, social processing, and reflective thinking among sensitive individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-high-sensitivity-tied-to-anxiety-depression-and-other-mental-health-problems"&gt;High Sensitivity Tied to Anxiety, Depression, and Other Mental Health Problems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis found moderate connections between sensitivity and both depression and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individual studies showed connections ranging from weak to strong, but all studies that measured overall sensitivity found positive links. Results varied across studies, but the general pattern remained: higher sensitivity typically went hand-in-hand with more &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/communication-mental-health/"&gt;mental health symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The review also identified positive associations with obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, and social phobia, though these relationships varied in strength.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different aspects of sensitivity showed varying relationships with mental health. The tendency to feel easily overwhelmed and having a low threshold for sensory input showed stronger connections with psychological problems than aesthetic sensitivity, which is the capacity to be deeply moved by art, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/music/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beauty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-healthcare-providers-can-better-help"&gt;How Healthcare Providers Can Better Help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, most therapists and doctors don’t routinely check for environmental sensitivity, potentially missing an important factor in their patients’ psychological makeup. Since about 31% of the general population show high sensitivity, this trait may also be relevant for many people in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous smaller studies have indicated that highly sensitive individuals may respond differently to psychological treatments. Some research shows they may benefit more from certain types of therapy, particularly &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mindfulness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mindfulness-based&lt;/a&gt; approaches that help manage overstimulation and emotional reactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the researchers write: “Better knowledge on the role of individual differences in sensitivity for mental health may not only inform theory but could also have practical implications” for treatment planning and how well interventions work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-research-on-highly-sensitive-people-can-and-can-t-tell-us"&gt;What the Research on Highly Sensitive People Can — and Can’t — Tell Us&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis has important limitations. Most studies relied on &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/college-students/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;college students&lt;/a&gt;, which may not represent the broader population. Most participants were young, educated women, so the results may not apply as well to men and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly all studies looked at people at one point in time, making it impossible to determine whether sensitivity causes mental health problems or whether having mental health issues makes people more sensitive. Only five studies followed participants over time, and just two examined people actually receiving mental health treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Study authors acknowledge that all studies relied on questionnaires, which can be affected by how people see themselves and want to present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this doesn’t prove that sensitivity causes mental health problems, it suggests this personality trait deserves more attention in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health research&lt;/a&gt; and potentially in clinical practice. For people who experience the world more intensely than others, understanding this aspect of their temperament could inform how they approach their mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/strong&gt; This article is a summary of peer-reviewed scientific research. It is provided for informational purposes only and should not be taken as medical advice. If you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns, please consult a qualified healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers searched seven major academic databases for studies published between 1997 and 2024. They included 33 studies with 12,697 participants (62.5% female, average age 25 years) that measured environmental sensitivity using standard questionnaires and assessed mental health through validated surveys. The earliest included study was published in 2000. For the main analysis, they examined 25 studies that specifically measured depression and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analysis showed positive relationships between environmental sensitivity and mental health problems. The main analysis found moderate connections for both depression (r = .36) and anxiety (r = .39). The broader review identified positive relationships with obsessive-compulsive disorder, PTSD, social phobia, agoraphobia, and physical symptoms, with relationship strengths ranging from weak to strong. Different parts of sensitivity showed varying relationships, with “ease of excitation” and “low sensory threshold” more strongly linked to mental health issues than “aesthetic sensitivity.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study had several important limitations including too many young, educated women in the samples and heavy reliance on college students. Most studies looked at participants at one point in time, preventing determination of cause and effect. Only two studies included people actually receiving mental health treatment rather than general population samples, and five studies were longitudinal. All studies relied on self-report surveys, which can be biased, and most were not preregistered. The research also showed variation between studies, suggesting other factors may influence the relationship between sensitivity and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-conflicts"&gt;Funding and Conflicts&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors declared no conflicts of interest. The paper does not specify funding sources for this review and analysis, though authors work at Queen Mary University of London, King’s College London, Trinity College Dublin, and the University of Surrey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-publication-details"&gt;Publication Details&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research was published online in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21677026251348428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on August 15, 2025. The paper was written by Tom Falkenstein, Luke Sartori, Margherita Malanchini, Kristin Hadfield, and Michael Pluess, with Michael Pluess as the main contact.

You will also see a reduction in belly fat as the fat in your liver begins to decrease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He went on to explain that eliminating sugar can restore a healthier gut microbiome—the trillions of microorganisms that live in the digestive tract and play a key role in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lastly, if you have acne or red spots, your skin should improve and look clearer,' he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The advice echoes recent research. A 2019 study of more than 8,000 students in China found that high-sugar soft drinks 'significantly' increased the risk of acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has linked excess sugar to liver fat accumulation and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A leading doctor has revealed cutting out sugar for just two weeks can improve your facial skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitians have long highlighted how cutting out sugar—which can trigger drug-like cravings—can boost health, fitness and even performance at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Samantha Coogan, a lecturer at the University of Nevada, has previously described the effects of quitting the sweet stuff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, stomach aches and bowel changes may last for days or even weeks, but once the body adjusts, she said people often see sharper brain function, fewer sick days and more energy for exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Coogan, hair, skin and nails also improve, sleep becomes more restful and weight loss is 'inevitable' when high-calorie snacks are eliminated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting sugar further reduces the risk of serious diseases, with excess intake widely linked to type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sugar is an addictive substance for some people, so it really is necessary to approach it in a similar manner to drug or alcohol detoxification,' she wrote in a recent article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the type most people overconsume are so-called 'free sugars,' found in sweets, chocolate, fizzy drinks and many processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But some naturally occurring sugars also count as 'free sugars' like those in honey, syrups, nectars, unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-b46d3920-7c20-11f0-a507-fd22384e2bb3" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15010145/Harvard-doctor-reveals-happens-FACE-you-cut-sugar-just-two-weeks.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;How much of 'free sugars' should you consume each day? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS says anyone aged 11 or older shouldn't consume more than 30g of added sugar a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they warn children and infants should have less. They recommend the following limits per day: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt; Children aged seven to 10 should have no more than 24g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Children aged four to six should have no more than 19g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children aged two to three should have no more than 14g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Children aged one should have no more than 10g of 'free sugars'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;While there is no guideline limit for babies under the age of one, sugars shouldn't be added to foods or drinks given to babies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, sugar that occurs naturally in milk, fruit and vegetables is not counted as 'free sugar,' according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To cut down, the health service recommends simple swaps such as replacing fizzy drinks or sugary squash with water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also warns that even unsweetened fruit juices and smoothies contain high levels of sugar, advising people to limit intake to no more than 150ml a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those who take sugar in hot drinks like tea or coffee, the NHS suggests gradually reducing the amount or switching to a sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The advice comes amid a sharp rise in type 2 diabetes cases in the UK, a condition that places immense pressure on the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, government figures estimated that 3.6 million people in England are now living with type 2 diabetes, based on an analysis of diagnosed and undiagnosed cases in each local authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Helen Kirrane, head of policy and campaigns at the charity Diabetes UK, previously said: 'Without the right treatment, it can lead to dangerously high blood sugar levels and this can cause life-altering diabetes-related complications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;A disease that turns rabbits into zombie-looking creatures is trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horned, demon-looking rabbits were reported hopping around Fort Collins, Colorado, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rabbits-with-horns-virus-colorado-tentacles-papillomavirus-98b1ad95ba3a0f308bf884d79d1eea7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press (AP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday. There have even been claims of the grotesque animals in Washington, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/unusual-zombie-rabbits-spotted-washington-state/BR3GF7UTNFC3ZIZ6GBVHCRE65Q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;KIRO 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus causes ‘zombie’ rabbit disease&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;Chase Gunnell, Communications Manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), told &lt;em&gt;MyNorthwest &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus (CRPV) is nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;“The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;Shope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt; papilloma virus (SPV), also known as cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), has been present in the U.S. for around a century and is not new in Washington,” Gunnell wrote in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunnell noted that while people have posted about the rabbits on social media in Washington — WDFW, &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;wildlife biologists, and veterinarians have not received any recent reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;“We cannot provide confirmation of a wildlife disease based on photos from social media alone,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRPV gives rabbits rough, red lesions around the ears, eyelids, neck, and shoulder, according to the book “Ferrets, Rabbits, and Rodents,” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cottontail-rabbit-papillomavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on ScienceDirect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths don’t harm the rabbits unless they interfere with eating, Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told &lt;em&gt;The AP&lt;/em&gt;. Once the animals’ immune system fights off the virus, the growths subside.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;h3&gt;‘Zombie’ rabbit disease cannot spread to other species&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for pets catching CRPV, Van Hoose said the virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit, but not to other species. Although the disease helped scientists research the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;human papillomavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;People who play certain wind instruments, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.8628"&gt;&lt;span&gt;like the didgeridoo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, may find it easier to breathe while sleeping, according to emerging research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new randomized controlled trial suggests that blowing through a conch shell is another option for keeping our airways clear when we sleep, reducing the risk of a condition known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affecting close to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(19)30198-5/abstract"&gt;a billion adults&lt;/a&gt; worldwide in some form, OSA is characterized by significant pauses in breathing while asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Among 30 participants with moderate OSA, roughly half the group were tasked with a traditional Indian exercise known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shankha"&gt;shankh&lt;/a&gt;, which involves using a conch-shell as a trumpet. Meanwhile, the other half practiced deep, slow breathing through the nose and out a relaxed mouth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-5-minute-breathing-technique-is-a-powerful-tool-to-reduce-anxiety"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Simple, 5-Minute Breathing Technique Is a Powerful Tool to Reduce Anxiety&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ultimately, researchers found that participants in the conch-blowing group slept better and woke up the next day feeling substantially more rested than the deep breathing group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The standard treatment for OSA is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, which keeps the patient's airway open by blowing air through a facemask throughout the night," &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093805"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; pulmonologist Krishna K. Sharma from the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"While effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and struggle to use it consistently."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regular breathing exercises like conch blowing could be a useful alternative.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants in the randomized controlled trial practiced their conch blowing with a traditional shankh for fifteen minutes, five days a week. B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;efore the trial, each participant was given a formal lesson on the yogic practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093805"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Sharma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate – areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;After six months, the group that practiced the conch exercises reported feeling 34 percent less sleepy during the daytime than the deep breathing group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep monitors also revealed that the conch blowing group had up to five fewer apneas a night. What's mo&lt;span&gt;re, they had significantly higher blood oxygen levels while sleeping.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The trial is small and not blinded, admits Sharma, but the results are clinically meaningful. He and his colleagues are now planning a larger trial at several hospitals to validate their findings in a more diverse cohort.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"We're particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA," he &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1093805"&gt;&lt;span&gt;explains&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00258-2025"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;ERJ Open Research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-proteins-to-reduce-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;Visceral fat&lt;/a&gt;—belly fat that wraps around your internal organs—isn’t just stubborn; it’s also linked to serious health risks like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and inflammation. It’s not a fat that you can see or feel, but an expanding waistline is one indication it’s there. While it can be challenging to lose–especially if you don’t have a good diet or exercise–the good news is certain superfoods can help reduce visceral fat. By adding the right foods into your diet, you can start trimming dangerous fat from the inside out. Here are 9 powerful superfoods that may help shrink visceral fat in just four weeks, according to nutrition expert &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://bodydesignsbymary.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Sabat&lt;/a&gt; MS, RDN, LD, who is also a personal trainer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avocados are not only delicious and can be enjoyed in so many ways, but they’re packed with nutritional benefits that help fight visceral fat. According to Sabat, “Avocados are rich in monounsaturated fats, which help reduce abdominal inflammation and improve insulin sensitivity — two key factors in shrinking visceral fat.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Tea is touted to be one of the healthiest beverages to drink because it can aid with everything from weight loss to improving mental clarity. According to Sabat, it also helps with visceral fat. “Green tea’s catechins and natural caffeine work together to increase fat oxidation, targeting stubborn belly fat without extreme dieting,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy for grilling, roasting, or sauteeing, extra virgin olive oil is healthy to cook with because it’s full of antioxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties. Sabat says, “Extra virgin olive oil contains compounds that lower inflammation, improve hormone balance, and encourage your body to burn fat over storing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s no secret that Greek yogurt is super healthy because it’s high in protein, essential nutrients and calcium. But it can also help get rid of visceral fat. “The protein and probiotics in Greek yogurt help maintain lean muscle and support a healthy gut microbiome, both tied to lower visceral fat,” says Sabat.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking one to two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar a day can help regulate blood sugar, support digestive health and aid in weight management goals. “A small daily dose of apple cider vinegar before meals may help reduce blood sugar spikes and promote gradual fat loss around the midsection,” says Sabat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gut health can influence other aspects of our health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber is important for a healthy gut, but so are several vitamins and minerals. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zinc, selenium, magnesium, and vitamins A, D, C and B vitamins are all needed for a healthy gut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From ongoing stomach pain to bouts of bloating, waves of nausea, watery stools and backed-up bowels, signs of digestive distress are more common than you may think. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/digestive-diseases" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 70 million people in the United States encounter some form of digestive dysfunction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to finding relief from the pangs of gastrointestinal discomfort, people may turn to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; and prebiotics. “While probiotics and prebiotics are tools that play a role in optimizing one’s gut health, those are not the only tools that are important for improving the balance of the gut community,” says &lt;a href="https://jejenoval.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;JeJe Noval, Ph.D., M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, an integrative and functional registered dietitian specializing in digestive and hormone health. A healthy gut also requires a well-balanced diet that includes adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. Here are the top seven vitamins and minerals for gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-zinc"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Zinc                                 &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As the second most abundant trace mineral in the human body, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/zinc-benefits-8407152" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;zinc has numerous functions&lt;/a&gt;. While it is well-known for its role in immunity, wound healing, growth and development, zinc is also essential for gut health, per a 2022 study published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/12/7/900" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biomolecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Zinc plays a crucial role in maintaining proper gastrointestinal health by aiding in the production of stomach acid necessary for effective digestion,” says &lt;a href="https://theorganicdietitian.com/about-me-2/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Sara Korzeniewski, RD, FDN-P&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and functional medicine practitioner, who notes that zinc and sodium are needed for optimal stomach acid levels to effectively carry out this function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But the gut-enhancing benefits don’t stop there. "Zinc can also help with restoring the tightness of cells that line the gastrointestinal tract,” says Noval. “Some good sources of zinc are dairy, eggs, legumes, nuts and seeds."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Korzeniewski agrees. "Zinc is necessary for preserving the integrity of the gut lining, preventing leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances," says Korzeniewski. "The best absorbable dietary sources of zinc include oysters, red meat and poultry."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-magnesium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is a remarkable mineral that keeps the gut moving and operating smoothly. "It helps relax the muscles of the gut, which further aids in the smooth movement of food through the digestive tract and prevents constipation," says Korzeniewski. "Insufficient magnesium intake can lead to GI problems like constipation, bloating and abdominal pain. Therefore, it is crucial to include magnesium-rich foods in one's diet as tolerated, such as spinach, avocados, anchovies and dark chocolate."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-selenium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Selenium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although selenium is primarily &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-for-hashimotos-disease-8773994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;known for its part in thyroid hormone metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, it is also a key mineral in digestive health. “Selenium plays a critical role in maintaining healthy digestion by supporting pancreatic homeostasis, which regulates the production of digestive juices," says Korzeniewski. "This essential mineral also aids in preventing inflammation and oxidative damage that can negatively impact gastrointestinal health."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Noval adds that selenium can also help balance the microorganisms in the gut. According to a 2021 study published in&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211732/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a diet that contains adequate selenium may enhance the gut microflora and protect against intestinal dysfunction.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "The top food sources of selenium include corn, garlic, goat and cow milk, Brazil nuts (depending on soil content), beef, pork chops, chicken breasts, seafood and eggs,” says Korzeniewski.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin D does more than keep your bones in tip-top shape. “Vitamin D is an essential nutrient crucial in maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal tract," says Korzeniewski. "The active form of vitamin D helps regulate the immune system's function, including the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), which is critical for the intestinal immune response. A lack of vitamin D can negatively affect the gut, including impaired immune function and increased inflammation."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Along with adequate sun exposure, Korzeniewski shares that the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2058503/vitamin-d-foods/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;best dietary sources&lt;/a&gt; include foods like oily fish, pastured egg yolks, pastured butter, grass-fed beef, liver and organ meats—among others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-a"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Vitamin A &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your eyes aren’t the only organs that benefit from sufficient vitamin A intake. "Vitamin A helps in the growth, repair and maintenance of the gut's mucosal lining, which acts as a barrier against harmful toxins and pathogens,” says Korzeniewski. “Vitamin A also improves the immune system by enhancing the production of immune cells that keep the gut healthy."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Noval notes that a deficiency in vitamin A can throw the balance within the gut community off. A 2020 review published in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7071260/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mentions that vitamin A deficiency may significantly alter the diversity of the gut microbiota, reducing beneficial bacteria and increasing harmful bacteria. Fortunately, vitamin A is found in the optimal form in foods like eggs, fish, liver and fortified food. Plant foods such as leafy greens, sweet potatoes, carrots and butternut squash contain beta carotene, which your body can convert into vitamin A.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-vitamin-c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is popular for its immune-supporting benefits. But &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-c-and-gut-health-8558337" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;your gut also relies on vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; to function at its best. “Vitamin C plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal health by acting as an antioxidant and aiding in the absorption of nutrients. It also helps in the synthesis of collagen, which promotes gut-lining health,” says Korzeniewski. You can obtain all the vitamin C you need in a day by consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;best sources&lt;/a&gt; include kiwi, guavas, papaya, bell peppers, strawberries, broccoli and oranges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-b-vitamins"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; B Vitamins &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of the eight B vitamins, several stand out for their ability to support intestinal health. “For instance, vitamin B1 is needed for the digestive system to function properly, while vitamin B6 contributes to synthesizing neurotransmitters that regulate intestinal movements," says Korzeniewski. "Other B vitamins, such as B9 and B12, are critical for forming healthy gut cells and preventing digestive disorders."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Certain B vitamins affect the proliferation of certain bacteria in the gut community,” says Noval. For example, a 2021 review published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531721000580?via%3Dihub" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nutrition Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;highlights that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a high intake of vitamin B2 is associated with an increase in &lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, &lt;/em&gt;which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and gut-lining-enhancing properties. Luckily, you can find B vitamins in a wide variety of foods, including whole grains, nuts, mushrooms, leafy greens, avocado, eggs, fish, meat and dairy.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-other-factors-that-affect-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Other Factors That Affect Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although the gut needs sufficient amounts of the nutrients mentioned above, additional aspects of gastrointestinal health are often overlooked. “Gut healing is a complex and multifaceted process that encompasses numerous factors. This includes dietary changes and other lifestyle modifications such as improving sleep quality, reducing environmental toxins and regulating the nervous system,” says Korzeniewski.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition, both dietitians agree that addressing unresolved stress and trauma can greatly transform the health of your gut. “Our bodies are incredibly resilient and well-equipped to maintain robust health, but our resilience decreases when we experience psychological stress, trauma and other adverse events, says Korzeniewski. "Therefore, addressing these underlying factors contributing to gut problems is crucial to healing the gut and optimizing gut health effectively."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Korzeniewski adds that embracing joy, passion and other positive aspects of life may significantly improve your gut's overall health and function. "A holistic approach to enhancing gut health will yield better long-term results than probiotics and prebiotics [alone]," says Korzeniewski.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-get-more-gut-healthy-nutrients"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Get More Gut-Healthy Nutrients &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The main way to get more nutrients into your body that support gut health is to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutritious foods. This includes fruits, vegetables, nuts and nut butters, seeds, whole grains, legumes, lean proteins and healthy fats. As you can see from our list above, dairy, eggs and meat, seafood and poultry all contain some of these necessary micronutrients. If you choose to a vegan diet, it's important to work with a knowledgeable professional, like a registered dietitian, to ensure you're getting the nutrients you need.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One way to improve your gut health is to ensure a nutrient-dense diet rich in zinc, magnesium, selenium and vitamins A, D, B and C. Each of these micronutrients plays a critical role in maintaining the gut lining, lowering intestinal inflammation, keeping digestive juices flowing and helping the gut run smoothly. Beyond the dietary aspects of gut health, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-are-aging-your-gut-11747309" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;it may also be beneficial to assess&lt;/a&gt; your sleep quality and toxin exposure as well as address any underlying stress.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's important to note that gut healing is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and what works for one individual may not work for another,” says Korzeniewski. For this reason, you may find it helpful to work with a registered dietitian who specializes in gut health and can guide you along your unique gut-healing journey.

An ECG of my heart was clear and my GP says we should monitor it for now.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;John Atha, West Yorkshire.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I suspect you are worried that there is a problem with your heart, but it seems to me your symptoms are more likely to be nerve related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can easily be confirmed by checking your pulse the next time your left arm goes numb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you press about 3cm back from the base of the thumb you should easily be able to feel blood pulsing through it, a sure sign that blood is pumping down your arm (helped by the heart) as it should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Your symptoms are most probably due to the root of one of the nerves in your neck being compressed,says Dr Scurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your symptoms are most probably due to the root of one of the nerves in your neck being compressed. There are several possible causes - the likeliest being foraminal stenosis, when one of the small openings through which nerves leave the cervical spine (bones in the neck) becomes narrowed by &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/osteoarthritis/index.html" id="mol-cb994570-7c21-11f0-a555-89681a222ec2"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Compression of the brachial plexus (a network of nerves in the armpit) is another possibility, however, this would cause your arm to appear blue/purple and mottled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One other possibility is cervical ribs which means there is an extra bone (or even bones) that has been in your neck since birth. Usually symptomless, it can sometimes cause intermittent tingling in the arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I suggest you ask your GP to refer you to an orthopaedic specialist, who can order a chest X-ray to check for cervical ribs, which can be surgically removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you don’t have cervical ribs, an MRI scan can check for nerve root compression. Physiotherapy is normally successful and so surgery is rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I do hope you soon receive the reassurance – and treatment – you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;I shout in my sleep and don’t remember anything about it in the morning but it annoys my husband so much I’ve moved into the spare room. What do you suggest?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Name and address withheld.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr Martin Scurr replies&lt;/span&gt;: I suspect you have a rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), where vivid dreams are acted out vocally and often physically. Such episodes take place during rapid eye movement sleep, one of the main sleep stages, during which brain activity increases and dreams occur – sometimes several times a night. It can be distressing to witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, the person enacting or shouting out in dreams typically cannot be roused and will have no recollection next morning. Indeed, in your longer letter you describe yourself as sleeping ‘very well’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RBD is most common in men aged over 50 but can occur in women as well. It is part of group of disorders, called parasomnias, which cause unusual behaviour while asleep – such as talking, shouting and sitting up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those affected may appear slightly awake and rather confused, before falling back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;I suspect you have a rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), where vivid dreams are acted out vocally and often physically, writes Dr Scurr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are a number of possible causes for your RBD – it can, for example, occur as a side effect of certain medication, such as antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as you describe yourself as ‘very fit’, I suspect there is no obvious underlying cause in your case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;I understand your wish to sleep alongside your husband without disturbing him so suggest you ask your GP to refer you to a sleep disorders clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One final point: RBD can be an early sign of Parkinson’s disease and so, if you have any symptoms you haven’t mentioned here, you should ask your GP to refer you to a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TV presenter Davina McCall says that having &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/article-14905673/Davina-McCall-not-scared-dying-anymore-brain-tumour.html"&gt;gone through frightening surgery for a brain tumour&lt;/a&gt; she no longer fears death – a useful mindset to adopt but one which many struggle to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, during my years of work in palliative care, I have looked after many people – including priests, an occasional Rabbi and medical colleagues who, you might expect, would approach the end of their lives calmly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet many display anxiety. Part of the aim of palliative care is to settle old regrets and help people depart life without fear. With sufficient resources, palliative care teams do this well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there may be another option. A number of studies investigating the effects of hallucinogenic drugs, particularly psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) on patients in the late stages of terminal illness have found that a single dose can reduce anxiety and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies are ongoing but I suspect this approach will, in time, become mainstream and be used with, or even in place of, opiates and sedatives, which ease many sensations but also risk reducing alertness, communication and clearheadedness which, for some, is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 11:05:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgFBVV95cUxOTEtYUXEzbjdDQldvUGxnNEJjdHlXRXdUNFU2U1hjc0dEdjFjN1piS3BnZDJua0xzZ3ZvUEYxSHJ0TzdVOVpwSWFTOXJadDFvQ1poUU1MLU81amJDWWU1WGZuYVl4MzBJNE4weURKSkFmQ3pVYXc4X1o2NkVvbS1LcGFZdGJkZ2pDZlFGTjZwcERBVjUyVHp5WE9FV1Fycko2MEVtS1NTYnRzcXlHN2hacGJyVE1IdG5sYUZfeG4tQTBZdjluRGg2RWQ4V1hqZw</guid></item><item><title>Burcum ：在RFK Jr.播下疫苗疑虑之际，明尼苏达州领导的一项努力在YouTube上遭到了抵制- Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxPX1lXdW1oZGtlLWlkU2ZlWEhNYlB4eGNwd1JvcnpnLTdCMXk3RE51Y2w0Wl9vVG0tendIQVIyMzRNcEZwOUh5dDk0TVlzM3RvREFfaEFncm5uTC1KSVRDMWlGMGtscS11Q0RVOWxENExoeGpJbnFvLWw5S3hYUUJmN1JLalNab3Z2N0Fad1J3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Fortunately, doctors generally have discretion in their practice.

The intervention group were trained to change their foot progression angle (toe-in or toe-out) by 5 to 10 degrees to reduce the load on the knee. The sham group underwent the same training, but their natural angle of foot progression was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 6 training sessions, they were encouraged to practice their walking technique for at least 20 minutes per day until it became natural. During the 1-year follow up, they attended the laboratory 3 times, so researchers could check that they were maintaining the prescribed angle while walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the study, the intervention group reported a larger reduction in pain than the control group, with the intervention group’s NRS pain score reducing, on average, by 2.5, and the control group’s by 1.3 from the beginning of the study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, MRI scans showed that the intervention group had less degeneration of their knee cartilage than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An exciting finding of this study is the potential slowing of cartilage degradation with gait retraining. While this holds substantial potential, further study is necessary to understand whether or not the amount of demonstrated slowing will translate to improved clinical outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– David Kruse, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could this be an effective alternative to medication?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that gait retraining could become an effective intervention for managing knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kruse advized that gait retraining is not always straightforward: “An individual’s gait, or walking pattern, is influenced by a unique chain of complex musculoskeletal structures. Understanding and examining normal gait patterns can be challenging. Consequently, making biomechanical changes to a person’s gait pattern can be very difficult.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding what changes are beneficial can be the first hurdle, followed by the challenge of establishing the alteration of gait as the individual’s new normal,” he advised. “Additionally, to address the complexities of the process, the analysis and re-training require specialized insight and expensive equipment. Therefore, modifying gait patterns is not a simple process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Mazzoli told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, new technologies could help solve these problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recently developed AI-based technology allows [us] to estimate knee loading and determine the best personalized foot angle for each patient. This could really allow gait retraining to become a readily accessible treatment. We really want to make use of this new technology, so that this gait modification can become widely available in the clinic for patients with knee [osteoarthritis].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/small-change-to-how-you-walk-may-help-relieve-osteoarthritis-pain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFB0SXlwZHFJLTV2WTVxWTVLdHp1UFNjSXdZTl9jaGNYRHhzSEZzQTJTLWhZZ2VKVzg5dWdCS1M4UkNXSU00SmNnTlBCN0JhV1RZYm9hR3FrOWpsdURVU1JKMkFhaGRIM1F6OHdwTzRB</guid></item><item><title>具有这种身体特征的男性更有可能患上癌症，专家警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNWo0UThuSHljUGxKei1ob2hhdXpFN3pCMWo4cUlGajMwVnpBalRtU1ZDLUlVNk1weXJXd3VYT24taGdSc0tTV3k3dmRkWFRTanFFd3dNRk0wWjJzZ2JkLVdHajRnOWEwRmYyT1dnYjFucVM4UkpZandHSXhVdjItbW9aWUVSRWN6TU9za2NubEtidHFXX21DNmlXd3Y?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading doctor has warned that 'man boobs' can be a sign of potentially deadly testicular &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a3682a90-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer or liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gynecomastia—when boys or men develop big breasts—can also cause sore or swollen nipples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-a36ae9b0-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says it is 'common' and does not always need treatment, sometimes it can be caused by underlying health issues which need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include kidney disease, thyroid problems or cirrhosis—permanent scarring of the liver often due to liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent video posted on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-a36ce580-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce" class=""&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; which has amassed more than 228,000 views, Dr Surak Kukadia, an NHS GP known as Dr Sooj shared other potential sinister causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The little-known symptom, he said: 'Is such an important sign to be aware of because it could be a sign for so many different things, including things like liver disease, testicular cancer and even breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And yes, men can get breast cancer.

In a Boston suburb, a wife who is struggling to lose weight for lack of a GLP-1 prescription finds herself being happy for — but also sort of resenting — her husband, who’s dropping pounds easily on a weight-loss drug. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I get up early to exercise while he’s in bed or watching the news,” she said. “It gets frustrating. I’m cutting my portions in half, and he wants to go out for ice cream.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, Amanda Torrey, 48, a nanny and a &lt;a href="https://theamandabookverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://theamandabookverse.com/"&gt;romance writer &lt;/a&gt;from Blackstone, is fighting an inner battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She’d like to lose 25 to 50 pounds, but instead has been gaining weight. Recently, she saw one of her many friends who is taking a GLP-1. The friend was 100 pounds thinner than she’d been, and looked “adorable,” Torrey said. “And she was feeling great.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Torrey couldn’t get the transformation out of her mind. “Maybe I should just do it,” she told her partner. He’d like to lose weight, too, but they reminded each other about the side effects and how they don’t want to start a drug they’d be on for life, or put themselves at the “whim” of an insurance company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So that was that. Or was it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Everyone else looks so good,” she said wistfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

She only makes more work for me. She leaves dirty dishes, laundry, and everything else strewn about for me to deal with. I have told my husband that it’s time for her to move out, but he doesn’t agree. So now I am stuck taking care of her and her dog, especially now that she has a full-time job. I need help encouraging my daughter to move along with her own life.&lt;/p&gt;

I would like to suggest that you don’t need help with your daughter—you need help with your husband! I’m sure your husband is a lovely man, but you would have solved this problem already if he hadn’t objected. So the key to your sanity will be getting on the same page &lt;em&gt;as partners&lt;/em&gt; regarding what you want your home life to be like. After that, you can make a plan to confront your daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vzrg000s3b79mks119i6@published"&gt;When you told your husband that your daughter needed to move out, what reason did he give for disagreeing with you? Maybe he thinks her presence is somehow good for your health or well-being. He might be under the impression that she provides a kind of companionship you benefit from. Or, perhaps his reasons have more to do with him; being the only caretaker in a home can be a lot of pressure and feel a bit lonely. He may feel relieved knowing that your daughter is there to share the burden, and thus be reticent to give that up. Whatever the case is, he needs to articulate why he wants your daughter to stay. And if she does stick around, he should be the one to either whip her behaviors into shape or make up for her oversights.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vztd000t3b79cq2an2rd@published"&gt;A serious illness is a surefire way to put one’s life into perspective—for both the patient and their partner. It causes some folks to draw their loved ones closer, while others yell, “YOLO” and book a Tanzania safari. Still others work to cultivate a peaceful and tranquil home. There is no wrong response. But in this case, as with most relationship discord, communication is key. You and your husband might not be able to reach a full consensus just yet, but I bet you can get there after a few thoughtful, vulnerable conversations. At the very least, I hope he agrees that dirty dishes and laundry are not a gift you should be forced to “receive” at this stage in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas school districts are coming back from summer with a rising number of parents asking for vaccine exemption forms and a new law that will make those documents even easier to obtain. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Combined with funding cuts to public vaccination programs, chilling effects of immigration policies on health care, and the wearying battle by school nurses to balance parental consent and overall student body health, Texas schools are on track to have the lowest vaccination rates in decades if exemption rates continue to climb. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I do think that there is a problem — period — that is worse than we have known about previously,” said Terri Burke, executive director of The Immunization Partnership, which advocates for public policies that support increased access to vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Since 2018, the requests to the Texas Department of State Health Services for a vaccine exemption form have doubled from 45,900 to more than 93,000 in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In July, ahead of the new school year, the state received 17,197 requests for a vaccine exemption form, 36% higher than the number reported in July 2023. Because each requestor can have forms for up to eight individuals, the number of children those forms covered also soared —  23,231 in July 2023 compared to 30,596 in July 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Now, as some public health departments indicate there are drops in the number of poorer children coming to them to get vaccinated during the summer months, and a new Sept. 1 law that will&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/25/texas-vaccine-form-download/"&gt; make the vaccination exemption form downloadable&lt;/a&gt; instead of it being mailed, vaccine experts fear herd immunity will be tougher to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Rebecca Hardy, president of Texans for Vaccine Choice, which successfully lobbied for the easier exemption process, suggests the fears are overblown. She said she hasn’t seen an increase in interest in exemption forms and insists that her organization exists to “support all parents, regardless of how they vaccinate.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="9f23bc3b-5d66-4a85-a9e5-7ef9b81dd42a" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Vaccination picture for Texas &lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Vaccination effectiveness relies on having enough people immunized so that those with compromised immune systems and cannot vaccinate are protected. The gold standard used by public health officials and schools is to have 95% of school-aged children vaccinated. A clear statistical picture of this school year’s vaccination rates will likely not be available for months.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;While vaccination rates for Texas kindergarteners hover around 93%, pockets of 80% or lower exist with &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/LIDS-Immunizations/pdf/2023-2024_K-12_Conscientious_Exemptions_by_District.pdf"&gt;some school districts reporting a high exemption rate&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;For example, in the Austin school district during the 2024-25 school year, 79.6% of kindergarteners were up to date on the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, a drop from 2020 when 96% were vaccinated. And in &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/04/west-texas-measles-outbreak-mennonite-seminole/"&gt;Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, where the West Texas measles outbreak began in January, 77% of kindergartners were vaccinated the same year. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas leads the nation with the most kindergartners —  more than 25,000 — who were not fully vaccinated against measles, followed by Florida and California, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html"&gt;data released last month&lt;/a&gt;. The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93.24% is the lowest it's been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Vaccine supporters, such as Burke, told lawmakers earlier this year that legislation to make the vaccine exemption form easier to obtain would inevitably drive down vaccination rates for school-age children.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In recent weeks, Burke said her organization has had disheartening conversations with pediatricians and public health officials who say vaccine skepticism has worsened. “Their frustration is that they can’t even bring up the subject with parents.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In the Waco district, more than 98% of kindergartners were vaccinated and less than 1% of students filed exemptions. Lana Scully, a school nurse in Waco, said even with the new downloadable option going into effect in September, she anticipates her rate staying low. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The main nuisance for parents wasn’t that exemption forms had to be mailed to them by the Texas Department of State Health Services, she said. Parents didn’t want to have to take the extra step of getting it notarized. That requirement will not change when the new downloadable form is made available next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You know there’s two inconveniences of it, well, actually three” Scully explained. “One is you have to go to the health department, pick it up. One is you have to get it notarized. And the last one is they’re only good for two years. So that kind of weeds out who's got the strong feelings versus who doesn't want to get to the doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Scully said she has no issue with parents wanting fewer vaccinations for their child. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“If somebody really has a strong conviction, great,” Scully said. “That's your strong conviction, and you're doing what's best for you and your family … But if it's just, I don't feel like taking my kid to the doctor 'cause I'm sitting on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune, it's a lot easier to go get the shots.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="8ff38312-0501-4d8d-8d79-4ea60f94a093" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;School challenges driving up vaccine delinquencies&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Funding cuts for schools have meant fewer school nurses and health aides and a crushing workload for those who remain. There’s the &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/post/houston-isd-had-170-malfunctioning-aed-before-students-death-marshall-middle-school-report-reveals/15206015/"&gt;constant managing of emergency health equipment&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining students’  daily medication regimens and caring for more kids with chronic illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Finally, there’s the year-round chase of parents for their child’s vaccination records — or vaccine exemption forms. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It was a snap decision, but it was oncoming,” said Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who abruptly retired from Bellaire High School in the Houston school district after 25 years in the profession. “This past year was the worst year I've ever had in school nursing.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Historically, Texas public schools have been a stopgap to compel vaccinations. S&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/school/back-to-school"&gt;tudents are required&lt;/a&gt; to be vaccinated to attend school unless they have a notarized exemption form or face being sent home until they have either. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As larger urban districts combat suburban ones for students, Texas school nurses are hearing often from districts, including Houston, not to let vaccination requirements prevent students from attending school. If every student without the required paperwork were denied entry to class, schools would lose out on its &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/27/texas-legislature-vaccine-mandate-bills/"&gt;basic allotment funds&lt;/a&gt; for each student enrolled.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“There are some superintendents that will say, ‘All kids come to school. I don't care if they've got their vaccines or not,’” said Karen Schwind, a past president of the Texas Association of School Nurses. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In the 2024-25 school year, 2.7% of kindergarteners did not have records of the required doses of the measles vaccine and lacked an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I have kids, been hounding them for two years,” Thomas recalled. “All I can do is send letters and call parents and beg.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Houston school district confirmed to The Texas Tribune in April that “at this time, we are not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status.” District officials more recently said their policy has not changed. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hardy, with Texans for Vaccine Choice, said her group “applauds any school that recognizes that being militant about vaccine paperwork simply makes no sense.”   &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Whether families submit shot records, vaccine exemptions, or a mix of both, it’s still just paperwork,” she said. All of those things are not a “measure of a student’s health and certainly irrelevant to the core mission of schools: to educate, not operate as ad hoc health clinics.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;h3 id="099d55fe-33bd-44b6-bd79-d5a1cf4f52c9" class="t-copy t-copy--level-3 t-align-left"&gt;Public health departments report some vaccination dips&lt;/h3&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Each year, many of the state’s school age children who have no health insurance or who are covered by Medicaid turn to public health departments for their vaccinations. Dallas and Austin public health officials have reported some decreases in visits to summer vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We typically have like, you know, big lines and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed,” said Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department. “This year it has not been that way.” &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Huang and his staff believe threats of ICE arrests and deportations have pushed more undocumented children and their parents to stay away from vaccination. In Texas, there are an &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/18/texas-border-schools-donald-trump-mass-deportations/"&gt;estimated 111,000 undocumented children&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Funding cuts have also contributed to the reduction of vaccinations, particularly among the uninsured and Medicaid health insured populations.  &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;During the pandemic, local health departments received a surge in federal funding. That boost allowed local health departments to “right size” their lean immunization programs for the first time in years. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We had 20, 25 team members, so we were able to see well more than 20 people [daily] or even conduct multiple clinics at a time,” said Chris Crookham, program manager of the immunization unit at Austin Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Today, public health officials are now scaling back after the f&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/12/texas-dshs-public-health-funding-cuts/"&gt;ederal government put an early end&lt;/a&gt; to such funding. “Now the team is down to just seven people, and so we're capping our clinics at 20 clients only,” Crookham said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In June, Austin Public Health and other local health departments braced for even more cuts, up to $28 million more in federal immunization cuts. Eventually, $1.7 million was cut from Texas and that entire amount was absorbed by DSHS through the agency’s own reduction in vaccine marketing materials and other budget-tightening measures. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Still, that potential pause forced local health departments to start scaling back and their employees to consider other career options. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;That happened at Austin Public Health, where its primary staff immunization nurse will be leaving for another job at the end of this month. &lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“The damage was done,” Crookham said. “We started to go through looking at a RIF [reduction in force] process, and because of that, people started looking for other jobs.”&lt;/p&gt;

What was the focus of your study, “Consumption of Red Versus White Wine and Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies?”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eunyoung Cho:&lt;/b&gt; We conducted this study as a meta-analysis, which means we put together a lot of published papers (42 studies) that looked at red wine and white wine separately. We wanted to see whether the association between red wine and cancer is different from white wine and cancer. It’s very well-known that alcoholic beverages – including wine – can increase cancer risk. There is no doubt about that. But then there are not a lot of studies looking at red and white wine separately. That was the focus of the research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Statistically, what was the difference in cancer risk between red and white wine?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cho: &lt;/b&gt;For red wine, the relative risk for the highest versus lowest level of intake was .98, which was not significant. And for white wine it was 1.00, which was not significant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which cancer types were examined in the study?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cho: &lt;/b&gt;We were able to look at breast, skin, ovarian, prostate, lung, kidney, urinary tract, and colorectal cancers, separately for red versus white wine. None of those cancers had a different association except for skin cancer. For skin cancer, only white wine was significantly related to increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why skin cancer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cho:&lt;/b&gt; It’s unclear. Our original hypothesis that we wanted to test in this study was whether red wine versus white wine is different. And that’s largely because red wine has some antioxidant compounds. One of the major ones is resveratrol (a natural compound found in the skin of some plants), which is known to reduce cancer in animal studies. Red wines have a lot more resveratrol. People postulate that red wine may be better in terms of cancer risk, however, overall, we didn’t find that it was. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did you find any relationship between cancer risk and the amount of wine consumed, given claims, for example, that a glass a day is good for heart health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cho: &lt;/b&gt;We could only compare low intake versus high intake, because each of the studies used different comparisons.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did the study consider outside factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet sunlight, smoking, or consumption of other alcohols such as beer or whiskey?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eunyoung Cho:&lt;/b&gt; We cannot conduct that kind of analysis, but if any of the studies adjust for sunlight exposure, if they adjust for other types of alcoholic beverages, we just use the data. We are not able to separately take into account confounding factors, such as sunlight exposure, in this type of analysis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did the study find any difference between men and women? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eunyoung Cho:&lt;/b&gt; There was no statistical difference. But when we looked at wine consumption, the association between wine and cancer risk was significant only in women. However, the sample size for women was larger. Statistical significance relies on the sample size. When we look at red wine and white wine in men and women separately, for women, red wine was not related to overall increased&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;cancer risk, but white wine was.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the compositional difference between red and white wine that makes people think they present different risks for cancer? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cho:&lt;/b&gt; Red wine contains a lot more grape skin, and the skin contains more antioxidant compounds like resveratrol. That’s how people hypothesize that red wine will be more beneficial than white wine. Based on our analysis, red wine is not any better than white, except when it comes to skin cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Were there any limitations to this study that you couldn’t account for?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cho:&lt;/b&gt; As this is a meta-analysis, we extract the data from published papers. So, 42 published papers and we were not able to adjust for certain things. ... We didn’t have a large sample size for many cancer sites. We didn’t have data on some cancer sites such as cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, or liver.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Would you make any public health, or dietary, recommendations based on the study?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cho:&lt;/b&gt; At this stage, I would consider our findings an interesting observation rather than a basis for public health recommendations. Our results suggest that drinking red wine may not be any better than drinking white wine in terms of cancer risk. It’s reasonable to say we shouldn’t view red wine as a healthier option than white wine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="divider"&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe’s weekly Ocean State Innovators column features a Q&amp;amp;A with Rhode Island innovators who are starting new businesses and nonprofits, conducting groundbreaking research, and reshaping the state’s economy.

The intervention group were trained to change their foot progression angle (toe-in or toe-out) by 5 to 10 degrees to reduce the load on the knee. The sham group underwent the same training, but their natural angle of foot progression was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 6 training sessions, they were encouraged to practice their walking technique for at least 20 minutes per day until it became natural. During the 1-year follow up, they attended the laboratory 3 times, so researchers could check that they were maintaining the prescribed angle while walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the study, the intervention group reported a larger reduction in pain than the control group, with the intervention group’s NRS pain score reducing, on average, by 2.5, and the control group’s by 1.3 from the beginning of the study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, MRI scans showed that the intervention group had less degeneration of their knee cartilage than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An exciting finding of this study is the potential slowing of cartilage degradation with gait retraining. While this holds substantial potential, further study is necessary to understand whether or not the amount of demonstrated slowing will translate to improved clinical outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– David Kruse, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that gait retraining could become an effective intervention for managing knee osteoarthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kruse advized that gait retraining is not always straightforward: “An individual’s gait, or walking pattern, is influenced by a unique chain of complex musculoskeletal structures. Understanding and examining normal gait patterns can be challenging. Consequently, making biomechanical changes to a person’s gait pattern can be very difficult.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding what changes are beneficial can be the first hurdle, followed by the challenge of establishing the alteration of gait as the individual’s new normal,” he advised. “Additionally, to address the complexities of the process, the analysis and re-training require specialized insight and expensive equipment. Therefore, modifying gait patterns is not a simple process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Mazzoli told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, new technologies could help solve these problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recently developed AI-based technology allows [us] to estimate knee loading and determine the best personalized foot angle for each patient. This could really allow gait retraining to become a readily accessible treatment. We really want to make use of this new technology, so that this gait modification can become widely available in the clinic for patients with knee [osteoarthritis].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:45:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOajc2S1R0cnRjVl9GU0hfTGNnMkVMQ3dha1VOanJzQjU5NldpVFlxdF9OS0FLd2s4a0ZFWWRYNEtfNEhab2tKcXdTUnNXTm0zRFZPRGw2bURUbTFnWjg1eFFjYjY2UC1TeDRZR0ppUWlmZEJnb2c0cHpIYjVBNzhEWDFFZVdiQ3gxd3F3ZHdhYnVJQlhnQTFma3hjZVFydEJXeG5FcTg4Z2hlLU0</guid></item><item><title>LASIK的替代方案-无需激光- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTFBqUWlqUmhaVVdXaktJS2xNOVRwdXRmUnZPUkluX2FpZFBzVl9TTE12bzRiUThCejFjTFdKcGM1a0tUbEpJSlVvdG5SeUhJbDlyS3kxS2Q4V3pHOGRSVXM5WElWVkZ2TVRjZFBqeVVmMmxuVDVzRjBn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have altered vision, ranging from blurriness to blindness. But not everyone wants to wear prescription glasses or contact lenses. Accordingly, hundreds of thousands of people undergo corrective eye surgery each year, including LASIK—a laser-assisted surgery that reshapes the cornea and corrects vision.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The procedure can result in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative side effects&lt;/a&gt;, prompting researchers to take the laser out of LASIK by remodeling the cornea, rather than cutting it, in initial animal tissue tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, presented his team's results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (&lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/events/fall.html" target="_blank"&gt;ACS Fall 2025&lt;/a&gt;) held Aug. 17–21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human corneas are dome-shaped, clear structures that sit at the front of the eye, bending light from surroundings and focusing it onto the retina, where it's sent to the brain and interpreted as an image. But if the cornea is misshapen, it doesn't focus light properly, resulting in a blurry image. With LASIK, specialized lasers reshape the cornea by removing precise sections of the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common procedure is considered safe, but it has some limitations and risks, and cutting the cornea compromises the structural integrity of the eye. Hill explains that "LASIK is just a fancy way of doing traditional surgery. It's still carving tissue—it's just carving with a laser."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the cornea could be reshaped without the need for any incisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Hill and collaborator Brian Wong are exploring through a process known as electromechanical reshaping (EMR). "The whole effect was discovered by accident," explains Wong, a professor and surgeon at the University of California, Irvine. "I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification."&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the body, the shapes of many collagen-containing tissues, including corneas, are held in place by attractions of oppositely charged components. These tissues contain a lot of water, so applying an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electric+potential/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electric potential&lt;/a&gt; to them lowers the tissue's pH, making it more acidic. By altering the pH, the rigid attractions within the tissue are loosened and make the shape malleable. When the original pH is restored, the tissue is locked into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Previously, the researchers used EMR to reshape cartilage-rich rabbit ears, as well as alter scars and skin in pigs. But one collagen-rich tissue that they were eager to explore was the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the team constructed specialized, platinum "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/contact+lenses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;contact lenses&lt;/a&gt;" that provided a template for the corrected shape of the cornea, then placed each over a rabbit eyeball in a saline solution meant to mimic natural tears. The platinum lens acted as an electrode to generate a precise pH change when the researchers applied a small electric potential to the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a minute, the cornea's curvature conformed to the shape of the lens—about the same amount of time LASIK takes, but with fewer steps, less expensive equipment and no incisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They repeated this setup on 12 separate rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. In all the "myopic" eyeballs, the treatment dialed in the targeted focusing power of the eye, which would correspond to improved vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cells in the eyeball survived the treatment, because the researchers carefully controlled the pH gradient. Additionally, in other experiments, the team demonstrated that their technique might be able to reverse some chemical-caused cloudiness to the cornea—a condition that is currently only treatable through a complete corneal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this initial work is promising, the researchers emphasize that it is in its very early stages. Next up is what Wong describes as, "the long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise," including tests on a living rabbit rather than just its eyeball. They also plan to determine the types of vision correction possible with EMR, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the next steps are planned, uncertainties in the team's scientific funding have put them on hold. "There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible," concludes Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

In February 2024, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation centralised the cases into &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/mdl/mdl-3094-re-glucagon-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-glp-1-ras-products-liability-litigation" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;MDL No. 3094&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. As of August 2025, legal trackers report more than 2,000 active cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs argue that Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Ozempic, and Eli Lilly, the company behind Mounjaro and Zepbound, failed to warn adequately about the severity and frequency of certain adverse effects. The companies maintain that their product information is compliant with federal regulations and that risks are clearly outlined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Claimed Side Effects and Patient Reports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central to the lawsuits are claims that patients developed gastroparesis, also known as stomach paralysis, after using the drugs. Other reported side effects include intestinal obstruction, ileus, persistent vomiting, gallbladder disease and, in some cases, &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://sskblaw.com/class-action-and-mass-tort/defective-drug-medical-device-lawsuits/ozempic-wegovy-lawsuits" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;vision loss from non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts note that GLP-1 drugs delay gastric emptying, which may contribute to gastrointestinal complications. While most patients tolerate the treatment well, some allege that prolonged use has led to severe and lasting health impacts requiring hospitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Spotlight on Zepbound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Ozempic and Wegovy were first to attract legal action, attention has increasingly turned to Zepbound, a tirzepatide-based drug approved for weight management in late 2023. Its rapid uptake among patients seeking weight-loss solutions has made it a key focus of lawsuits and regulatory reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated Zepbound's product information to &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2025/217806Orig1s020lbl.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;include ileus in postmarketing reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a condition involving a blockage of the intestines. This change aligned with similar label updates made to Ozempic and Mounjaro, strengthening claims that manufacturers were slow to act on emerging risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Regulatory Response and Safety Warnings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA has previously added warnings to Ozempic, including a 2023 revision noting reports of ileus. All GLP-1 drugs carry a boxed warning about the risk of thyroid C-cell tumours based on animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, the &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/fdas-concerns-unapproved-glp-1-drugs-used-weight-loss" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;FDA also issued an advisory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide, warning patients against using unapproved formulations. The agency cited quality and safety risks, highlighting an increase in adverse event reports connected to such products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Company Response and Legal Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have rejected allegations of wrongdoing, insisting that the lawsuits are without merit. Both companies point to extensive clinical trial data and years of post-approval monitoring to defend the safety profiles of their drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, &lt;a rel="noopener nofollow" href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/novo-nordisk-files-14-lawsuits-unapproved-semaglutide-drugs/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Novo Nordisk filed 14 new lawsuits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August 2025 against U.S. pharmacies and clinics accused of selling unapproved compounded versions of semaglutide, underscoring the company's efforts to protect its brand and maintain control of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where the Court Case Stands&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multidistrict litigation remains in the discovery phase, with monthly status conferences scheduled in 2025. No bellwether trials have yet been announced, and no settlements have been reached. Legal analysts expect the first test cases to be scheduled once discovery and expert evidence reviews are completed, a process that could extend well into 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="filed-under"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>International Business Times UK</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:25:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQYUtuRDNzMUlIUklqSk1fWGxUZmdiNHhzR3ppeFFja21VcWJJYmMyNG5YMjd3NEZlUHZVOEh0b1FGTWVrcV9tS1lTYlJXNkxqRDNrLVNKU3JzUDR2Y1RhRF9IN0IyVG9OM1VER2I4bXZfbm92QW5GOG5aQS1vNFhSYVBrd2tzRDZ5QTBEaHRVb05OZERodk5oQ2tmaVZzT2txZ2E4R2o2TEp1VUtPT2ppaVBqX1VqWTExa0d5eW1fdFROQQ</guid></item><item><title>蓝白突破：以色列首次进行实验室培养脊髓移植- Ynetnews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE45T0hMYU10WEdRZ0hMa1VKckVYVzI1RmVsTk9mQnZIM3htWEdYODRGWGVNX0NRUkZtVWdMclJOVzN3TGNORURKUkFVRkxjNFl4OTZ6SXRZU1hLaXRjLWUyV0hJU2JuSURIb2Vv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ArticleHeaderComponent" class="ArticleHeaderEngComponent1280 selectableShareable for-print" role="header" aria-label="article header"&gt;&lt;p class="mainTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h1 class="mainTitle"&gt;Blue-and-white breakthrough: Israel to perform first-ever transplant of lab-grown spinal cord&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="subTitleWrapper"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span disabled class="subTitle" contenteditable="false"&gt;Tel Aviv University researchers have grown human spinal cord stem cells, aiming to help paralyzed patients walk again; after successful animal trials, Health Ministry approves moving forward with human testing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 09:21:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE45T0hMYU10WEdRZ0hMa1VKckVYVzI1RmVsTk9mQnZIM3htWEdYODRGWGVNX0NRUkZtVWdMclJOVzN3TGNORURKUkFVRkxjNFl4OTZ6SXRZU1hLaXRjLWUyV0hJU2JuSURIb2Vv</guid></item><item><title>您可以从马桶座圈中感染疾病吗？ - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxPZjd4TGZiMklOVnRENG1QSndSREdZeVc3RnhTS2c0OFJ0czBrSGtIcFdWOFlpMXN6NW1hd1JqQ0Z4c0d0N0lWWTNNV3M5aHBTc09EcC1fRjZna0x1RW0yRmpJQXhManVoS1cxbi1oWUczcE1BMU5NYjViRnBXQnpVSkhhcVQtZndzZ0Utcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-85f9acf9-0 ilQTUs"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are more effective interventions, says Paddy, like making toilet bowls with shields that go between the bowl and the seat. Currently, these are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://splashblocker.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;largely used in healthcare settings &lt;/a&gt;to protect nurses and doctors from patients' flushed pathogens, says Paddy. There are also air &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;sprays &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; have been demonstrated to be effective in sanitising the air and surfaces&lt;/a&gt; in bathrooms, therefore helping to counteract the dissemination of pathogens via toilet "sneezes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another option is to just flush and then leave the stall immediately. "I usually do the flush and run," says Gerba. He also recommends waiting 10 minutes before going into a public toilet after somebody else, though that might be tricky to achieve in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;If you bring your phone to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Then there are mobile phones. It's not recommended to use your phone while in the toilet stall, says Roberts – your phone is already exceptionally dirty, as you take it with you everywhere, rest it on every ledge, and touch it all the time. If you bring it to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall, and then you'll carry them around with you even after washing your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The simplest thing you can do is to always wash your hands immediately after you go to the bathroom, says Gerba, who notes that the average person in Tucson, Arizona, only spends 11 seconds washing their hands, while the Centers for Disease Control in the United States &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests handwashing for 20 seconds&lt;/a&gt;. "Only about one in five actually wash their hands adequately," says Gerba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, to prevent catching a disease in the public restroom, wash your hands. Better still, add an extra step of applying hand sanitiser too, as the combination is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/hand-sanitizer-facts.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;significantly more protective than handwashing alone&lt;/a&gt;. And try not to let the fear of pathogens lurking in toilets keep you up at night – your risk is (probably) lower than you think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="*-disclaimer.-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only,-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-gp-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;* Disclaimer.

&lt;p&gt;But we all have dreams for that future, and so we went into public health knowing it was not a great approach to riches, and we also knew it was not likely we would ever be thanked. People don’t thank us for something they did not know they were destined to encounter. So we must be secure in the knowledge that what we are doing has a beneficial impact. It became clear when smallpox disappeared with the strategic use of vaccine. It became clear that measles transmission was stopped in this country because of a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/19/measles-elimination-declaration-2000-texas-new-mexico-vaccines-mmr/"&gt;deliberate strategy using vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, plus surveillance and all of the tools of public health. The majority of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/nvsr69-12-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;increase in longevity&lt;/a&gt; in this country through the 20th century was due to public health, the stealth ingredient of health improvement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But our view of the future did not include a vision that people would hunt us down with some of the most powerful guns developed for use in war. And we ask, “Why?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the Covid-19 crisis, public health practices were overturned. The usual approach was for a federal recommendation to states, counties, cities, and tribes that could be modified to fit local situations. The federal plans typically included getting vaccines and expertise to the field as needed. At the request of states, federal employees would be assigned to the states with supervision coming from the state. Public health people did not worry about the lack of federal authority to enter the state to help. These were people of quality, serving the public good and they could be trusted. The relationship between CDC and the states was so close that a phone call would usually lead to an invitation from the state. I worked on both sides of that agreement, in the state of Colorado and at CDC. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Covid, the Trump White House gave a different message. The president told the states to develop their own plans and compete for resources. Chaos was the result.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In May 2020, when we thought the public health damage had reached its limits, the president withdrew from the World Health Organization, a decision so thoughtless that no one had a ready response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The National Academy of Medicine developed a plan for vaccine distribution when supplies were limited. I was in my 80s but could isolate at home, so a healthy 30-year-old who was required to interface with the public could have been higher on the priority list under the NAM framework. That would have been the right move. Instead, the White House decided everyone 65 and over was a priority, making logical distribution more difficult. Their idea of sound practice was to hire a Stanford professor with no public health experience, Scott Atlas, who promoted the idea of letting low risk individuals get Covid to provide herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We thought public health was on a path toward healing when suddenly, in his second term, President Trump acquired the peculiar expertise of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He promotes raw milk, which can transmit pathogens; promotes the rotting of children’s teeth; and despite exhaustive testing that has shown &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/03/vaccine-autism-rfk-jr-how-science-proves-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism/"&gt;vaccines don’t cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, clings to that belief for reasons that defy understanding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One would think Kennedy’s track record of nonsense would win no followers, yet there are people willing to accept drivel from those in positions of authority. Kennedy would be less hazardous if he decided to do cardiac surgery. Then he would kill people only one at a time rather than his current ability to kill by the thousands. Why is it that killing a single person is seen as murder but killing masses is excused if you are a politician?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite this environment, those working in public health must continue to keep the objectives of their profession in mind: prevent premature death, reduce unnecessary suffering, and improve the quality of life for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We need to define the challenges faced. We have always been challenged by nature with organisms, droughts, malnutrition, and climate change. We have also been challenged by human foibles with addictions to alcohol, tobacco, violence, and power discrepancies. Now we have special challenges because of those who hold power but have no concept of public health responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But we can face these new challenges with our traditional threefold approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, try to get the science right. Thomas Henry Huxley, the famous 19th century biologist, described science as “common sense at its best.” Science is not the same as truth, but it is our best avenue to seek the truth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, add art to create “creative common sense at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And third, add the &lt;a href="https://iep.utm.edu/roger-bacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moral compass that Roger Bacon called for&lt;/a&gt; 800 years ago. The pope asked for a summary of science, and Bacon warned him that science has no inherent moral compass. Therefore, it needs scientists with a moral compass. When that is done, we have the ability to strive for “moral common sense at its best.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will live through this drought of values, principles, and facts and again apply our talents to improving global health and happiness. Do not back down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, be clear. Kennedy’s words can be as lethal as the smallpox virus. Americans deserve better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;William Foege, M.D., served as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, founder of the Task Force for Global Health, and executive director of the Carter Center and was instrumental in the eradication of smallpox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;/div&gt;

Eye specialists emphasize that conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and even certain cancers can be detected early through a comprehensive eye exam. These changes are usually invisible to the patient but can be identified by trained professionals using advanced imaging tools. Detecting these early signs allows timely intervention, protecting both vision and overall health, and sometimes even saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="28369076" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Eye-signs" source="Orion"&gt;Eye signs&lt;/keyword&gt; that unmask systemic diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes offer a unique, non-invasive window into the body’s overall health. A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine highlights that multiple systemic diseases, ranging from diabetes and hypertension to cholesterol disorders, autoimmune conditions, and cancers, often manifest subtle signs in the eyes before other symptoms appear. Retinal blood vessels, for instance, can reveal early vascular problems since they are directly observable, unlike most internal blood vessels. Eye care professionals trained to recognize narrowing, deposits, or abnormal pigmentation in the retina are often the first to identify these risks. Regular eye exams therefore provide critical early warning signals that support broader disease prevention and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Basic yoga poses that bring down BP naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes: detected years before other symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is often dubbed the silent disease because it can cause organ and tissue damage long before noticeable symptoms appear. According to the National Eye Institute of the US, diabetic retinopathy is one of the earliest detectable complications. High blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina, causing swelling, leakage, or abnormal vessel growth. Studies, including a 2025 Medscape review, show these retinal changes can precede classic diabetic symptoms and even blood test diagnosis. Early detection through routine eye screenings is essential, particularly for people with risk factors like obesity or a family history of diabetes. Timely intervention can prevent vision loss and reduce the risk of serious complications associated with prolonged high blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol visible in the eyes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol often develop silently, causing serious health risks without obvious symptoms. The eyes, however, can reveal early signs before complications arise. Hypertensive retinopathy, caused by prolonged high blood pressure, damages tiny retinal vessels, leading to narrowing, thickening, or bleeding. Similarly, high cholesterol may manifest as yellow deposits on the eyelids (xanthelasma) or cholesterol plaques inside retinal vessels, known as Hollenhorst plaques. The Frontiers in Medicine review and expert insights from clinics like Heart of Texas Eye Care emphasize that detecting these subtle eye changes early can prompt lifestyle or medical interventions that reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and vascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer and neurological diseases can be spotted too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes may also provide early warning signs for certain cancers and neurological disorders. Eye cancers, such as retinoblastoma or ocular melanoma, may first appear as abnormal pigment changes or lesions in the retina. Additionally, systemic cancers sometimes metastasize to the eyes, and subtle retinal pigment abnormalities, such as patterns resembling a bear’s paw, have been linked to colon cancer. Neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis and brain tumors, can cause early symptoms like double vision, unequal pupil responses, or sudden reading difficulties. Research shows that visual field testing and detailed eye exams can identify these issues before patients notice significant symptoms, highlighting the critical role of the eye in early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glaucoma and other silent threats detected early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma, often called the silent thief of sight, progresses without obvious symptoms until irreversible vision loss occurs. The disease develops when intraocular pressure rises, damaging the optic nerve. A 2019 study noted that systemic factors like age, hypertension, and high cholesterol may increase glaucoma risk. Normotensive glaucoma, where eye pressure remains normal, may result from low blood pressure or conditions like sleep apnea. Early detection through eye exams, including optic nerve evaluation and pressure measurements, allows timely treatment, often preventing permanent vision loss. This reinforces why glaucoma screenings are a key part of routine eye care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why regular eye exams matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine confirms that comprehensive eye exams serve as a frontline tool for detecting hidden health risks. Routine eye care does more than preserve vision; it can uncover early signs of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cancer, and neurological disorders. Eye specialists are often the first to detect subtle changes that other tests might miss. By scheduling regular exams, patients can identify silent threats early, receive timely treatment, and take proactive steps toward maintaining both eye and overall health. Your eyes can truly be a window into your body’s hidden health story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.
