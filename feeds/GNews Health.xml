Once considered an older person's disease, cardiovascular causes are striking younger adults who often appear healthy just moments before collapsing suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a one-year autopsy-based study from AIIMS, it was found that more than half of all sudden deaths in this age group were due to heart-related problems, the major killers being CAD along with other cardiovascular conditions. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom before death, often leaving families in shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The particular report carries much significance, as it advocates for a better level of awareness regarding heart disease, especially in seemingly healthy persons. The early recognition of subtle and atypical warning signs can save lives. Whereas the classic symptoms of a heart attack, like sharp chest pain, are well-known to all, in many young adults, these atypical warning signs do not appear serious on the face of it. Early detection and timely intervention make all the difference — it saves lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 03:47:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>我们的大脑仍然可以使用一个巧妙的技巧来超越人工智能- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/our-brains-can-still-outsmart-ai-using-one-clever-trick</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Despite the rapid advances in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, the humble human brain still has the edge over computers in its ability to transfer skills and learn across tasks. A new study reveals how we likely do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by a team from Princeton University, the researchers behind the new study didn't actually run tests on humans, but instead used animals that are very close to us in terms of biology and brain function: rhesus macaques &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhesus_macaque"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These monkeys were asked to identify shapes and colors on a screen, and to look in particular directions to give their answers. While this was happening, brain scans were used to check for overlapping patterns and shared areas of activity in the animals' brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/computers-made-from-human-brain-tissue-are-coming-are-we-prepared"&gt;Computers Made From Human Brain Tissue Are Coming. Are We Prepared?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those scans showed the monkey brains using different blocks of neurons – 'cognitive Legos', in the words of the researchers – across tasks. Existing blocks can be repurposed and recombined across new tasks, showing a neural flexibility that even the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/does-using-artificial-intelligence-ruin-your-actual-intelligence-scientists-investigated"&gt;best AI models&lt;/a&gt; can't compete with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"State-of-the-art AI models can reach human, or even super-human, performance on individual tasks," &lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/news/2025/cognitive-legos"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Tim Buschman, from Princeton University. "But they struggle to learn and perform many different tasks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that the brain is flexible because it can reuse components of cognition in many different tasks. By snapping together these 'cognitive Legos', the brain is able to build new tasks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the video below, the animals had to discriminate between shapes and colors in three separate but related tasks that required the animals to continually learn and apply what they knew from one task to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cognitive Lego blocks the researchers identified were concentrated in the brain's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;. The region is linked to higher cognition – solving problems, planning, making decisions – and seems to play an important role in cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that when certain cognitive blocks weren't needed, activity in them was reduced, suggesting the brain can file away the neural Legos that it doesn't immediately need to better focus on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think about a cognitive block like a function in a computer program," &lt;a href="https://pni.princeton.edu/news/2025/cognitive-legos"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Buschman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One set of neurons might discriminate color, and its output can be mapped onto another function that drives an action. That organization allows the brain to perform a task by sequentially performing each component of that task."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It explains how monkeys and possibly humans can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-has-a-hidden-rhythm-and-it-may-reveal-how-smart-you-are"&gt;adapt to challenges&lt;/a&gt; and tasks they haven't seen before, and use &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-critical-boom-in-technology-traced-back-more-than-half-a-million-years"&gt;existing knowledge&lt;/a&gt; to tackle them – something that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-intelligence" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73092" data-postid="185062" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; in its current form struggles with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further down the line, the researchers suggest their findings could help train AIs to be more adaptable to new tasks. Their work could also be useful in developing treatments for neurological and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/several-psychiatric-disorders-share-the-same-root-cause-study-reveals"&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/a&gt; where people struggle to apply skills to new settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, these cognitive Legos show, on a fundamental level, how our brains are more flexible and adaptable than AI models, which exhibit so-called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1611835114"&gt;catastrophic forgetting&lt;/a&gt;: a weakness that means neural networks can't learn consecutive tasks without forgetting how to perform the last one they trained on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-multitasking-gets-trickier-and-even-dangerous-as-we-age"&gt;task-switching&lt;/a&gt; isn't exactly great &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-multitasking-drains-your-energy-reserves-and-what-you-can-do-about-it"&gt;for our brains,&lt;/a&gt; applying what we know from one task to another can be a useful shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If, as suggested by our results, the brain can reuse representations and computations across tasks, then this could allow one to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment, either by learning the appropriate task representation through reward feedback or by recalling it from long-term memory," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09805-2"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09805-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first successful human implant of a 3D-printed cornea made from human eye cells cultured in a laboratory has restored a patient’s sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina-based company that developed the cornea described the procedure as a ‘world first’—and a major milestone toward its goal of alleviating the lack of available donor tissue and long wait-times for people seeking transplants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Precise Bio, its robotic bio-fabrication approach could potentially turn a single donated cornea into hundreds of lab-grown grafts, at a time when there’s currently only one available for an estimated 70 patients who need one to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This achievement marks a turning point for regenerative ophthalmology—a moment of real hope for millions living with corneal blindness,” Aryeh Batt, Precise Bio’s co-founder and CEO, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/precise-bio-completes-first-human-cornea-transplant-using-3d-printed-lab-grown-tissue" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, a corneal implant manufactured entirely in the lab from cultured human corneal cells, rather than direct donor tissue, has been successfully implanted in a patient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the transplant was performed Oct. 29 in one eye of a patient who was considered legally blind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a game changer. We’ve witnessed a cornea created in the lab, from living human cells, bring sight back to a human being,” said Dr. Michael Mimouni, director of the cornea unit at Rambam Medical Center in Israel, who performed the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JUST WOW&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Tooth Is Implanted in 34-year-old’s Eye to Restore His Vision After Two Decades" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/tooth-is-implanted-in-34-year-olds-eye-to-restore-his-vision-after-two-decades/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Tooth Is Implanted in 34-year-old’s Eye to Restore His Vision After Two Decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was an unforgettable moment—a glimpse into a future where no one will have to live in darkness because of a shortage of donor tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubbed PB-001, the implant is designed to match the optical clarity, transparency and bio-mechanical properties of a native cornea. Previously tested in animal models, the company said its graft is capable of integrating with a patient’s own tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outer layer of the eye—covering the iris and pupil—can end up clouding a person’s vision following injuries, infections, scarring and other conditions. PB-001 is currently being tested in a single-arm phase 1 trial in Israel, which aims to enroll between 10 and 15 participants with excess fluid buildups in the cornea due to dysfunction within its inner cell layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise Bio said it plans to announce top-line results from the study in the second half of 2026, tracking six-month efficacy outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGHT RESTORED WITH STEM CELLS&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a title="Sight Restored to People Blinded in Eye Accidents Using New Stem Cell Treatment" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/sight-restored-to-people-blinded-in-eye-accidents-using-new-stem-cell-treatment/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Sight Restored to People Blinded in Eye Accidents Using New Stem Cell Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corneas are designed to be compatible with current surgery hardware and workflows. Shipped under long-term cryopreservation, it is delivered preloaded on standard delivery devices and unrolls during implantation to form a natural corneal shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PB-001 has the potential to offer a new, standardized solution to one of ophthalmology’s most urgent needs—reliable, safe, and effective corneal replacement,” said Anthony Atala, M.D., co-founder of Precise Bio and director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ability to produce patient-ready tissue on demand could lead the way towards reshaping transplant medicine as we know it.”&lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes, it’s unfair to judge people based on their worst behavior; at other times, the worst behavior is so scarring that it ends up defining the relationship for us, like it or not. Now is the time to take stock. Is the relationship otherwise loving, with open communication and a strong sense of equality/both partners’ needs being met? Or was this a leak from a torrent of domineering behavior that disregards your ability to consent in favor of his comfort/pleasure? That is, is this plausibly a one-time thing, or part of a pattern?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="237" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmj4jhs4100223b78wvgjqh7i@published"&gt;His peeing on you without discussing it with you first was not OK. Though there are plenty of piss enthusiasts out there, many people are disgusted by the notion for good reasons: Most of us are taught from an early age that such waste is dirty and should be avoided at all costs. As with any kink or fetish, though, regardless of the cultural associations around it, it should have been discussed ahead of time and you should have been given the opportunity to voice your disinterest. You had no reason to expect that your husband would do this, especially because you were still in bed. Those who are into piss tend to arrange for such play to be carried out in a manner that is easy to clean after—they may love it, but they typically don’t want to live in the smell of it. This may involve doing it in the shower/bathtub or putting special sheets on the bed that contain the liquid without absorbing it. There was an overall lack of consideration on your husband’s part by not discussing his interest with you ahead of time and by then &lt;em&gt;pissing in the bed you sleep in&lt;/em&gt;. It’s “out of his system,” fine—just make sure that’s true and make clear that these kinds of surprises are not welcome. If you have a hard time moving forward, you may want to enlist the help of a counselor.&lt;/p&gt;

I wouldn’t mind but, our sex is hindered by the fact that it’s hard for my husband to maintain an erection. If he takes a pill, it will get hard but he says it gives him headaches. I hate to say this, but without the pill, his penis is either half hard or gives out in the middle of us making love—so I am very seldom satisfied. Afterward, he just goes to sleep. He thinks it’s great. I don’t want to hurt his feelings. It’s funny because I used to be the one with a low sex drive, but now I want more sex! How can I make this better?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmj4jivs9002h3b78fd08yj98@published"&gt;Definitely prioritize not hurting your husband’s feelings. This does not mean letting him off the hook for not being a thoroughly considerate partner, but you want to communicate so that he can hear you. I think first, you must determine what it is that you want. You are “dealing” with your husband’s penchant for early morning and late night sex. What would be better for you? Figure it out and ask for it. You’ve been doing it his way as a matter of default—that has bought you leverage. “I think it would be really hot if we …” is a positive way to frame this as a potentially pleasurable experience for both of you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmj4jivs9002i3b787n3ychj7@published"&gt;Other people’s erections are, uh, hard to manage. He’s talked about getting a headache from pills before, so maybe that’s your way in. I don’t know how extensively he’s sampled the different PDE5 inhibitors on the market, but sometimes people tolerate them differently. So if sildenafil (Viagra) gave him a headache, he may want to try tadalafil (Cialis) and/or vardenafil (Levitra) to see if he has better results. He could also try a cock ring. This is a delicate topic and you should handle it as sensitively as possible. It is fair for you to want a more reliable dick, but in attempting to achieve that, don’t insult him. You might ask him if he’s satisfied with his erection quality. If he’s not, there’s an in, too.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmj4jivsa002j3b78yvb1qf7z@published"&gt;Say he has no designs to do anything about the erections that underwhelm you. Are there other means of getting off that would suit you? If so, request them: oral, manual, toys, etc. You have every right to ask him to help you orgasm before he turns over and falls asleep. You can say something like, “I’m happy that you find our sex so satisfying—can you help me get off, too?” And then tell him how you want him to do that. Be specific.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it is also based on a fallacy. Her son is not too young to understand why you’d be sleeping in the same room. If he notices at all, which is unlikely as he is 3 and still exists mostly in his own head, all his parents would have to say to him is that his uncle is staying in the same room as another man because they are married. Unless a huge deal is made about something like this, kids tend to roll with the punches. Some uncles marry women, others marry men, still others marry people who don’t fit neatly into either category. Some never get married. Easy. If for some reason, this isn’t easy, there are several picture books made for kids that explain LGBTQ+ identities—&lt;a href="https://www.readbrightly.com/30-great-lgbtq-books-kids/"&gt;here’s a big list of them&lt;/a&gt;. Gay people are a part of the world this kid lives in, and shielding it from him is an exercise in futility. In fact, your presence in his life and household gives his parents the opportunity to explain that some people are gay, which may be different than what he is used to, but makes you no less worthy of familial bonds and love. That your sister and her husband seem to want to bury this truth is very disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;

There’s a middle ground to explore where you refuse discriminatory boarding terms but keep your sister in your life. It seems like this is the first time you’ve come up against something so overtly steeped in homophobia from this family member—you haven’t yet pushed back nor seen her reaction to the pushback. I don’t think you should tolerate sustained bigotry, but I also know that sisters are hard to come by and it’s worth finding a solution to keep family members in your life. It’s not always possible, but you should at least try.&lt;/p&gt;

(Incidentally, I have no time for people who talk about how queerness risks confusing children. To be a child is to be in a state of perpetual confusion, and as detailed above, this one’s particularly easy to clear up.) But you could get a hotel/Airbnb nearby so that you can spend time with your family during the holidays. This way you don’t have to compromise your marriage &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; your holiday plans.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve gotten back into sex and dating, and I’ve mostly been having vanilla sex. It’s … not satisfying. I find myself missing kink, but it’s also caught up in missing my husband. My friends think I’m just mourning and confused, but I’m not so sure. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/12/new-sex-interests-friends-grief-advice.html"&gt;Is there a way to get back into kink after what I’ve been through?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

These circulating compounds appear to influence how metabolic pathways function within the liver and how sensitive the body is to insulin. The findings point to potential new strategies for treating obesity and type 2 diabetes. The study was published in &lt;em&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The hepatic portal vein drains much of the blood from the intestine to the liver. Therefore, it's the first place to receive products from the gut microbiome. In the liver, they can be conjugated, transformed, or eliminated, and then enter the systemic circulation," explains Vitor Rosetto Muñoz, first author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at the Ribeirão Preto School of Physical Education and Sports at the University of São Paulo (EEFERP-USP) in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By analyzing the blood leaving the intestine and the peripheral blood circulating throughout the body, we were able to more accurately observe the enrichment of these metabolites derived from the gut microbiome in each location and, consequently, how they can modify hepatic metabolism and metabolic health," adds Muñoz. He completed this work during an internship at the Joslin Diabetes Center at Harvard Medical School in the United States with support from a FAPESP scholarship under the guidance of researcher Carl Ronald Kahn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gut Microbiome Diversity and Metabolic Disease Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, scientists have increasingly recognized that the gut microbiome acts as a key link between genetics, environmental factors, and the development of metabolic disorders. Studies have shown that people and animals with obesity, type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance, or insulin resistance often have distinct gut microbial compositions compared to those without these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, researchers still struggle to determine which specific bacteria or microbial products drive these differences or how they interact with intestinal tissues. To explore this question, the recently published study examined metabolites in the blood of mice that varied in their susceptibility to obesity and diabetes. Samples were taken from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the intestine to the liver, and from peripheral blood, which travels from the liver to the heart before circulating through the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Normally, studies tend to look at metabolites present in fecal material or peripheral blood, but they don't accurately reflect what's first reaching the tissue of the liver, which is an important metabolic organ linked to different diseases," says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental and Genetic Effects on Metabolite Profiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy mice, the team detected 111 metabolites enriched in the hepatic portal vein and 74 in peripheral blood. When mice genetically predisposed to obesity and type 2 diabetes were fed a hyperlipidemic diet (rich in fat), the number of metabolites enriched in the hepatic portal vein dropped from 111 to 48. This finding indicates that environmental factors, such as diet, can strongly influence the distribution of these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metabolite profiles in these susceptible mice also differed from those observed in a strain of mice naturally resistant to metabolic syndrome. This contrast suggests that genetic background plays a central role in shaping which metabolites appear in the hepatic portal vein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This shows that both the environment and the host's genetics can interact in complex ways with the gut microbiome. As a result of these interactions, different combinations of metabolites may be sent to the liver and subsequently to the peripheral circulation. These metabolites likely play an important role in mediating the conditions that lead to obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome," says Muñoz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Microbiome Disruption and Metabolite Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify which bacteria and microbial byproducts contribute to these metabolite patterns, the researchers treated obesity and diabetes susceptible mice with an antibiotic designed to target specific intestinal microorganisms. As expected, the treatment altered the microbiome and changed the balance of metabolites in both peripheral blood and the hepatic portal vein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One outcome was an increase in metabolites such as mesaconate, which participates in the Krebs cycle, a fundamental energy-producing pathway in cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this insight, the scientists exposed hepatocytes (liver cells) to mesaconate and its isomers, which are chemical compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. The treatments improved insulin signaling and regulated genes involved in hepatic fat accumulation (lipogenesis) and fatty acid oxidation, both of which are crucial processes for maintaining metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The metabolites found in the blood of these two sites, therefore, play important roles in mediating the effects of the microbiome on liver metabolism and the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes insulin resistance, which is related to eating a high-fat diet," says Muñoz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps in Mapping Gut Driven Metabolic Pathways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists now aim to characterize each metabolite in greater detail and determine how they are produced. This deeper understanding of microbial influences on metabolism may eventually lead to the identification of molecules that could serve as new therapeutic options for metabolic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

T&lt;span&gt;his includes the six percent of adults who say they are currently taking one of these drugs, according to a KFF poll.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But more and more people are exploring ways to naturally increase the hormone and harness its weight-loss abilities by eating the&lt;span&gt; right foods and following gut-supporting habits that can significantly boost how much and how often the hormone is released.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As registered dietitian nutritionists and personal trainers with more than 15 years of experience, we reveal the top foods to eat for boosting your natural GLP-1 without using the drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nutrition Twins (pictured) reveal the top foods to eat for boosting weight loss, along with some of their favorite products&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Fiber is the foundation of natural GLP-1 support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fiber slows digestion, stabilizes blood sugar and naturally encourages GLP-1 release, all of which support fullness and weight management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-6a168fb0-d5d1-11f0-9789-efd82214dd7b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15257157/Nutrition-Twins-natural-ozempic-weight-loss-GLP-1.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Fiber options for turning on your body’s natural 'Ozempic'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Garlic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Onions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Leeks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Green Bananas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Jerusalem artichokes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Oats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Cooked and cooled grains and potatoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Lentils&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Chickpeas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Beans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Apples&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Asparagus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Root vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Prunes &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;High-fiber foods also add volume to meals, keeping you satisfied while managing calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prebiotic fibers are non-digestible carbs that feed beneficial gut bacteria. These bacteria ferment prebiotics into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which signal your gut to release GLP-1 and peptide YY, another hormone that helps you feel full and regulate appetite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Garlic and onions are two examples of prebiotic-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Resistant starch is a special type of prebiotic fiber that resists digestion in the small intestine and reaches the large intestine intact, where it then feeds gut bacteria to produce SCFAs. This stimulates GLP-1 and PYY release, promoting fullness and helping with calorie control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Good sources of resistant starch include lentils and cooked-and-cooled potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another type of fiber known as fermentable fibers are found in beans, oats, apples, root vegetables and prunes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These fibers also encourage SCFA production, reduce inflammation, and enhance GLP-1 signaling, contributing to appetite regulation and supporting weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Protein: Satiety hormones in action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Protein-rich foods naturally stimulate hormones that help you feel full, including GLP-1 and PYY, which signals to your brain that you have eaten enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pairing protein with fiber slows digestion, prolongs satiety and helps curb cravings, supporting weight management and steadier energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that protein-rich meals - often containing around 20 to 30g or more, raise GLP-1 and PYY - though responses can vary depending on the rest of the meal and individual biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Our top protein options to boost natural GLP-1 include eggs, fish, poultry, beans, lentils and yogurt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prunes are a good source of fiber, which slows digestion, stabilizes blood sugar and naturally encourages GLP-1 release, all of which support fullness and weight management (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Healthy Fats: Sustained fullness and GLP-1 support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy fats slow digestion and help support GLP-1 release, keeping you fuller longer and helping curb cravings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pairing these fats with fiber and protein maximizes satiety and steadies blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even small amounts - ideal for calorie control, like a drizzle of olive oil, a few nuts or a slice of avocado - can make a meaningful difference in meal satisfaction while supporting your body’s natural GLP-1 response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Our top choices include olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds and fatty fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Polyphenols &amp;amp; Antioxidants: Nourish your gut and GLP-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Polyphenols are plant compounds that feed beneficial gut bacteria and help support GLP-1 release. Foods rich in polyphenols also act as antioxidants, reducing inflammation that can interfere with hormone signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Top polyphenol- and antioxidant-rich choices include blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, pomegranate, dark chocolate with 70 percent cocoa or higher, green tea, grapes and apples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Healthy fats, which include those found in nuts, slow digestion and help support GLP-1 release, keeping you fuller longer and helping curb cravings (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Live Probiotics: live support for your gut and GLP-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Live fermented foods provide beneficial bacteria that support GLP-1 and PYY signaling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Key strains include Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Akkermansia muciniphila, and they’re linked to increased GLP-1 production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Akkermansia thrives when paired with polyphenol-rich foods, prebiotic fibers and omega-3s. Preclinical studies show it produces a protein called P9 that signals gut cells to make more GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of our favorite probiotic and gut-supporting foods include yogurt with live cultures, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, tempeh and miso, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-bbb0a5d0-d5d2-11f0-9789-efd82214dd7b" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15257157/Nutrition-Twins-natural-ozempic-weight-loss-GLP-1.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;How to easily add more GLP-1-boosting foods to your meals &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Breakfast&lt;/span&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Top oatmeal or whole-grain cereal with berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sprinkle with nuts or seeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Enjoy Greek yogurt with fruit and a pinch of chia or flaxseeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Add a few slices of avocado or a light drizzle of olive oil to scrambled eggs or savory toast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Try a smoothie with kefir, spinach, frozen berries and a scoop of protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Lunch&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Toss beans, lentils or chickpeas into salads or grain bowls with a teaspoon of olive oil–based dressing for healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Include lean protein such as grilled chicken, turkey or tofu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Dinner&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roast a mix of colorful vegetables and drizzle lightly with olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Include fiber-rich sides like quinoa, barley or lentils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Choose fatty fish like salmon or anchovies and rotate with lean proteins like chicken, turkey or plant-based options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Add miso soup or fermented vegetables like kimchi or sauerkraut for gut support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Snacks and drinks&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Include small portions of fruit, nuts, seeds and fermented foods daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sip green or black tea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These cells -- also known as "zombie cells" -- stop multiplying but fail to clear themselves from the body as healthy cells normally do. They appear in many conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and throughout the aging process. Although scientists are working on ways to eliminate or repair these cells, a major challenge has been detecting them within living tissue without disturbing nearby healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Mayo Clinic, writing in the journal &lt;em&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/em&gt;, describe a new method for labeling senescent cells. Their approach uses "aptamers" -- short pieces of synthetic DNA that fold into three-dimensional structures. These structures can attach to proteins found on the outer surfaces of cells. In experiments with mouse cells, the team identified several rare aptamers, selected from more than 100 trillion random DNA sequences, that were able to recognize specific surface proteins and mark senescent cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This approach established the principle that aptamers are a technology that can be used to distinguish senescent cells from healthy ones," says biochemist and molecular biologist Jim Maher, III, Ph.D., a principal investigator of the study. "Though this study is a first step, the results suggest the approach could eventually apply to human cells."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How a Chance Conversation Sparked a Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that led to this project began when a Mayo Clinic graduate student shared an offbeat thought during a casual discussion with a classmate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keenan Pearson, Ph.D. -- who recently received his degree from Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences -- had been working with Dr. Maher on how aptamers might be used for neurodegenerative diseases or brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, several floors above, fellow graduate student Sarah Jachim, Ph.D., was studying senescent cells and aging in the lab of researcher Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their paths crossed at a scientific gathering, where they exchanged ideas about their thesis projects. Dr. Pearson wondered if aptamers could be adapted to detect senescent cells. "I thought the idea was a good one, but I didn't know about the process of preparing senescent cells to test them, and that was Sarah's expertise," says Dr. Pearson, who became lead author of the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentors Back a Bold Student Idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students brought their concept to their advisors and to researcher Darren Baker, Ph.D., whose work centers on senescent cell therapies. Dr. Maher recalls that the idea initially struck him as "crazy" but worth exploring. All three mentors supported the proposal. "We frankly loved that it was the students' idea and a real synergy of two research areas," says Dr. Maher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As early experiments produced promising results, the pair enlisted more students from their labs. Then-graduate students Brandon Wilbanks, Ph.D., Luis Prieto, Ph.D., and M.D.-Ph.D. student Caroline Doherty added new techniques, including advanced microscopy and additional tissue types. "It became encouraging to expend more effort," Dr. Jachim says, "because we could tell it was a project that was going to succeed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revealing New Clues About Senescent Cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond providing a tagging method, the research offered insight into the biology of senescent cells. "To date, there aren't universal markers that characterize senescent cells," says Dr. Maher. "Our study was set up to be open-ended about the target surface molecules on senescent cells. The beauty of this approach is that we let the aptamers choose the molecules to bind to."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that several aptamers attached to a variant of a protein called fibronectin on the surface of mouse cells. Scientists do not yet know how this fibronectin variant relates to senescence. However, its discovery suggests that aptamers may help identify features unique to senescent cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Applications for Human Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More work will be needed to find aptamers that can reliably detect senescent cells in human tissue. If aptamers can be adapted for this purpose, they could eventually be used to deliver treatments directly to these cells. Dr. Pearson notes that aptamers are less costly and more flexible than traditional antibodies, which are commonly used to distinguish one cell type from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This project demonstrated a novel concept," says Dr. Maher. "Future studies may extend the approach to applications related to senescent cells in human disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-31azim-0 eBMXOi nextSwipeIgnore sentry-block"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU sc-wlmftc-0 ccDPKb"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-1k7glnk-1 dDVXDN irZnNR"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 htsIMX"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-263151"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”. Add a couple of short full-body &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions into the mix and you have a decent &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/short-workouts-plan-fitness-dan-john-b2737277.html"&gt;minimalist workout plan&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your step count became the ultimate modern humblebrag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 cztisH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-263152"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 gtVitN hgzWpY"&gt;Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 exGSyR"&gt; (Harry Bullmore/The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential drawbacks of the Japanese Walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the information above paints the Japanese walking method in a favourable light – as it should, with the protocol delivering impressive results in a non-intimidating time-span. However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 15:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOc0RPQ042dmZvckQ4eDdDMVNvZWk5YmtKcHJBQWhRbEU0c1UxaVk1OUw5dTRSdy1KeV92Qi1rNnZSQWM2aHFjQy1nT1F3eldId25VUWVlTGc0WUZ6X2tVWDh4VzBQZzRFakkycHpmSVg2Q3NETW9CMjBKdFdqWkVfNFRoMzV4ZlRpdkROa3pHZ3VkazFITGVFSXpwQUw4ZXNnWVdYWXFfdVZGbXhiT1RhRnQ1cTdZUQ</guid></item><item><title>阿托伐他汀召回可能会影响数十万患者–并反映出FDA在检查海外生产的药物时遇到的麻烦-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/atorvastatin-recall-may-affect-hundreds-152027420.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you take cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, you may have noticed a flurry of &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/10/23/generic-statin-atorvastatin-calcium-recall/86861216007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news coverage;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;news coverage&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/atorvastatin-recall-october-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:late October 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;late October 2025&lt;/a&gt; about an extensive recall of thousands of bottles of atorvastatin, the generic version of Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both generic atorvastatin and brand-name Lipitor contain the same active ingredient, atorvastatin calcium, and are considered bioequivalent by the Food and Drug Administration.

Even if you have the recalled pills, taking them is still better than not taking the medicine at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can determine whether your medication came from Ascend Laboratories by looking at your prescription label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Search for the abbreviations &lt;a href="https://www.printablelabeltemplates.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/prescription-label-template-microsoft-word-prescription-label-template-best-business-template-within-prescription-label-template-RfKgMc.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MFG or MFR;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;MFG or MFR&lt;/a&gt;, which stand for “manufacturing” or “manufacturer.” If it says “MFG Ascend” or “MFR Ascend,” that means that Ascend Laboratories supplied the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The first five letters of a National Drug Code, abbreviated as NDC on the prescription label, also reveal the manufacturer or distributor. &lt;a href="https://ndclist.com/ndc/67877-513/package/67877-513-10" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ascend products have the number 67877;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ascend products have the number 67877&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If Ascend Laboratories is the distributor, a pharmacist can cross-reference your prescription number to obtain the lot number and compare it with the &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/?Event=97639" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:posted lot numbers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;posted lot numbers&lt;/a&gt; on the FDA website for recalled atorvastatin.

This has limited the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019881692" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:FDA’s ability to provide the oversight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;FDA’s ability to provide the oversight&lt;/a&gt; required for drugs sold in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the 1990s and early 2000s, the FDA &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019881692" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:performed routine surveillance inspections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;performed routine surveillance inspections&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. manufacturing plants every three years, but seldom conducted them overseas. In the wake of several high-profile manufacturing quality lapses, including at &lt;a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/generic-drug-manufacturer-ranbaxy-pleads-guilty-and-agrees-to-pay-500-million-to-resolve-false-claims-allegations-cgmp-violations-and-false-statements-to-the-fda/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Indian generic drug giant Ranbaxy Laboratories;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the Indian generic drug giant Ranbaxy Laboratories&lt;/a&gt;, Congress &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-track-agency-wide-program-performance/fda-track-generic-drug-user-fee-amendments-gdufa-performance-reports" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:established a funding mechanism;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;established a funding mechanism&lt;/a&gt; and the FDA established a universal standard for inspecting both U.S. and overseas manufacturers every five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, the U.S. fell behind with international inspections after COVID-19 shut down international travel, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:it has yet to catch up;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;it has yet to catch up&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, overseas manufacturers generally get warning of an upcoming inspection, making the process potentially less rigorous than in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A lack of inspections for eye drop manufacturers, especially in India, led to massive recalls in 2023 after a wave of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280241233255" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rare eye infections;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;rare eye infections&lt;/a&gt; caused some people to lose their eyesight. The problem was traced to widespread unsanitary manufacturing conditions and improper testing for sterility at overseas facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/publichealthpolicy/fdageneral/114762" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eight deaths and multiple hospitalizations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;eight deaths and multiple hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt; led an Indian manufacturer, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals, to recall 47 million potassium chloride extended-release capsules that did not dissolve properly. In February 2025, inspectors found that the company had falsified quality results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The FDA recently started &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:laboratory spot testing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;laboratory spot testing&lt;/a&gt; of prescription and over-the-counter drugs arriving in the U.S. to compensate for these limitations. Outside laboratories such as &lt;a href="https://www.valisure.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valisure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Valisure&lt;/a&gt; also do independent testing. Independent testing has caught several dangerous products, but due to limited resources, only a few products can be tested each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2023, Alkem Laboratories, which manufactured the currently recalled atorvastatin, had to recall 58,000 bottles of the blood pressure drug &lt;a href="https://www.hmpgloballearningnetwork.com/site/pln/news/beta-blocker-recalled-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metoprolol XL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;metoprolol XL&lt;/a&gt; because the pills also did not properly dissolve. Spot testing also led to widespread recalls after FDA and Valisure laboratories found cancer-causing chemicals called nitrosamines in some &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1060028019892222" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure, diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;blood pressure, diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.10043" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:indigestion drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;indigestion drugs&lt;/a&gt; tested between 2019 and 2020, as well as benzene in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10600280251343626" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:numerous sunscreen and antibacterial gel products;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;numerous sunscreen and antibacterial gel products&lt;/a&gt; tested between 2020 and early 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Raising consumer vigilance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With these growing gaps in oversight, it’s reasonable to be mindful of changes in how a particular medication affects you. If your prescription drug suddenly stops working, it might be because that particular batch of the medication was not manufactured properly. Alerting the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical-product-safety-information/medwatch-forms-fda-safety-reporting" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:about sudden loss of drug effectiveness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;about sudden loss of drug effectiveness&lt;/a&gt; could help the agency more quickly identify manufacturing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2024, the FDA started &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/partners-networks/international-activities/bilateral-interactions-non-eu-regulators/united-states" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sharing the inspection burden;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sharing the inspection burden&lt;/a&gt; with other regulatory agencies like the European Medicines Agency for the European Union. Such coordinated efforts could lead to less duplication and a bump in inspections of overseas manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, however, consumers are largely at the mercy of spotty inspections and testing, and rarely hear about problems unless poorly manufactured drugs cause widespread adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="http://theconversation.com/us?utm_source=Yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=related-link&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related-link-0&amp;amp;utm_content=article-268364" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

It's why doctors and nutritionists alike consider the first meal of the day to be most important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthwithhunter.shop/pages/about-me" target="_blank"&gt;Hunter Stoler&lt;/a&gt;, a NYC-based certified nutrition and health coach, has a go-to breakfast that he eats just about every day to feel his best. Known as "&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/healthwithhunter/" target="_blank"&gt;Health with Hunter&lt;/a&gt;" on social media, the 25-year-old also recommends this breakfast to his more than 400,000 followers on Instagram and 300,000+ followers on TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll say six out of every seven days a week, I have a yogurt bowl just because I know it's balanced," Stoler tells CNBC Make It.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His yogurt bowl recipe is high in fiber and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="withOneTrustPlaceholder-placeholderDimensions OneTrustLoadingPlaceholder-container"&gt;&lt;span class="DynamicLoadingIndicator-spinnerParent" data-test="DynamicLoadingIndicator" data-testid="DynamicLoadingIndicator"&gt;&lt;span class="DynamicLoadingIndicator-spinner"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It sets me up for success, it makes me feel good and I'm full for a few hours after that," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The breakfast allows him to up his fiber intake, which, research shows, many people often lack in their diets. Less than 10% of U.S. adults get the recommended daily intake of fiber, according to a study which was presented at &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/n24/" target="_blank"&gt;Nutrition 2021 Live Online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the key ingredients in Stoler's daily yogurt bowl.

He mixes together almond milk or whole milk with a cup of glyphosate-free oats and a scoop of protein powder.

    &lt;p&gt;Her message was echoed by Nick Thayer, the head of policy for the Company Chemists Association. He said there is “no national shortage of flu vaccines, but the bulk of them are administered in October and November”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that “by the time you get to December, some places are running low, and some will have none left from their original allocation”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may therefore need to shop around for your flu vaccine. “Look on the websites for pharmacies, look on the NHS website, if you are eligible for a free jab or talk to your local pharmacy and ask,” Thayer advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are unable to get the vaccine before Christmas, stick to the basics to reduce your risk of catching the flu. These include handwashing, avoiding crowded indoor gatherings, staying home when unwell, and self-isolating within families where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flu jab remains a valuable layer of protection, according to Dr Clarke. It is safe and generally thought to achieve maximum protection for an individual after 10 to 14 days. Whilst there is still a chance you might get the flu after having the jab, it is likely to be milder and not last as long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection from the flu vaccine goes down over the year and the types of virus it protects against are updated annually, which is why it is important to stay up to date with your inoculations, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst this year’s dominant strain is thought to be a mutated version of the influenza A virus, data shows that the flu vaccine still provides good protection against it. The UK Health Security Agency found it has been &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade"&gt;70 to 75 per cent effective at preventing hospital attendance in children aged 2 to 17, and 30 to 40 per cent effective in adults&lt;/a&gt;. This is broadly in line with effectiveness in previous flu seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost 17 million vaccines have been delivered this autumn, which is 350,000 more compared to this time last year, although Dr Clarke wishes more of us would choose to be inoculated. The latest National Flu and Covid-19 Surveillance Report shows that only 70.9 per cent of over-65s have received their flu jab this season. Rates amongst eligible under-65s are far lower, hovering around 35 per cent. “It really would make a difference,” says Dr Clarke.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;A recent study points to a potential link between GLP-1 drugs and its ability to reduce risk of epilepsy in people with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 drugs (semaglutide) are those which mimic the function of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) hormone. &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/health/who-should-avoid-ozempic-doctor-explains-why-the-drug-is-not-for-everyone-9803567"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; is the brand name for semaglutide, which is a once-weekly injectable formulation that is approved for adults in India with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, along with diet and exercise. GLP-1 receptor agonists helps in regulating blood sugar levels, appetite and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. It offers early evidence of neurological benefits from these medications. While the findings reveal only a link, larger, randomised controlled trials are needed to verify if &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/health/weight-loss-drug-ozempic-launched-in-india-priced-at-rs-8-800-a-month-9797458"&gt;GLP-1 drugs &lt;/a&gt;truly protect against epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Study Uncovers Epilepsy Risk Reduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edy Kornelius, MD, PhD, of Chung Shan Medical University in Taichung, Taiwan, and study author said, "Additional randomized, controlled trials that follow people over time are needed to confirm these findings, but these results are promising, since people with &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/health/can-chewing-curry-leaves-on-an-empty-stomach-help-in-managing-diabetes-9800482"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; are at increased risk for developing epilepsy later in life. Epilepsy can have many physical, psychological and social consequences, and many people do not respond to the current medications, so finding ways to reduce this risk is critical."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers tapped into a U.S. health database, analysing adults newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes who started either GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors, or gliptins). None of the participants had a prior diagnosis of &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/health/early-diagnosis-saves-lives-why-recognizing-seizures-early-can-change-the-course-of-epilepsy-9635287"&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt; or seizure. The GLP-1 medications included dulaglutide, liraglutide and semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-ndtv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Findings and Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers followed 452,766 individuals, averaging 61 years old. Half of them (226,383) received GLP-1 drugs like dulaglutide, liraglutide, or semaglutide. The other half got DPP-4 inhibitors. These individuals were followed for at least five years, tracking new epilepsy diagnoses. Data showed 1,670 epilepsy cases (2.35%) among GLP-1 users versus 1,886 (2.41%) in the DPP-4 group-a small but notable gap. Adjusted results show a modest reduction in epilepsy risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers adjusted for confounders like age, &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/health/high-blood-pressure-symptoms-5-signs-of-hypertension-during-pregnancy-9807707"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, and other comorbidities. The refined results indicated GLP-1 users had a 16% lower risk of developing epilepsy compared to DPP-4 users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking it down by drug, semaglutide stood out with the strongest protective signal. Dulaglutide and liraglutide also trended positively, though less pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Expert Insights and Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More research is needed, but these findings support the theory that GLP-1 drugs may have neurological benefits beyond controlling blood sugar," Kornelius said. "It should be noted that these findings do not imply that DPP-4 inhibitors are harmful in any way or that GLP-1 drugs are definitely beneficial for brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs mimic the gut hormone glucagon-like peptide-1, boosting insulin release, slowing digestion, and curbing appetite. Their rising popularity, fueled by weight-loss brands like Ozempic (semaglutide) and Wegovy, has sparked interest in other benefits, including potential neuroprotective roles seen in animal models for conditions like Parkinson's and &lt;a class="sp_lnk2" href="https://www.ndtv.com/health/hearing-loss-an-early-warning-sign-for-alzheimers-study-warns-dont-ignore-these-other-red-flags-9689285"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has its limitations. Its retrospective, observational nature can't rule out unmeasured biases. Newer drugs like tirzepatide (a GLP-1/GIP dual agonist, marketed as Mounjaro or Zepbound) weren't included, as they launched post-study period and the results don't apply to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors like missing data on epilepsy risk factors; family history, genetics, alcohol consumption, or sleep disorders, further impacts interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these hurdles, the large sample and rigorous adjustments shows credibility. Epilepsy affects over 50 million worldwide, with diabetes as a known risk amplifier via shared pathways like inflammation and vascular damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: This content including advice provides generic information only.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;In a blow to the medical cannabis establishment, a team of psychiatrists performed a detailed analysis on 15 years of cannabis research — and found not only that medical marijuana doesn’t seem to help people with acute pain or insomnia, which proponents often tout, but that almost of third of medical weed users are abusing the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The findings, published in the medical journal &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;, will likely further fuel an ongoing debate on &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/01/marijuana-legalization-drawbacks/681519/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;whether the states went too far with legalization&lt;/a&gt;. And it comes at a wild moment: just as &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/12/12/marijuana-thc-cannabis-laws-state-federal-trump" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;president Donald Trump signaled&lt;/a&gt; this week he’ll loosen federal restrictions on weed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“While many people turn to cannabis seeking relief, our review highlights significant gaps between public perception and scientific evidence regarding its effectiveness for most medical conditions,” said Michael Hsu, lead author and addiction psychiatrist at the University of California, Los Angeles, in a &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/evidence-lacking-medical-cannabis-most-conditions" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Clear guidance from clinicians is essential to support safe, evidence-based decision-making when discussing medical cannabis with their patients,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The team looked over more than 2,500 clinical trials that studied the efficacy of medical marijuana products and also certain cannabinoids, which are isolated cannabis compounds, approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in “HIV/AIDS-related anorexia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and certain pediatric seizure disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;On the question of pain management, the team found very little sign that cannabis help&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; with acute pain. They found the same for insomnia, and sleep trials that studied whether cannabis helped with getting a restful night of slumber came up with very little evidence of its effectiveness as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Researchers also found that 29 percent of medical marijuana users showed evidence of “cannabis use disorder,” a catch-all term for people who show a problematic usage pattern with the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;But the team did find&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that FDA-approved cannabinoids had a “small but significant reduction in nausea and vomiting” for people going through chemotherapy for cancer and other situations where people have difficulty keeping food down. They also helped people with AIDS/HIV retain or increase body weight when up against a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“There are some legitimate purposes for these compounds,” Kevin Hill, one of the study authors and an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/12/health/medical-cannabis-benefits.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “And there’s a whole other group of people who are saying they’re using it medically, but they’re really not. They’re just rationalizing their recreational use.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Related to that point, the team found that high-potency cannabis was associated with increased risk for developing signs of psychosis compared to the low-potency stuff, while smoking weed daily increased the risk for heart complications, such as coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s clear that there are people who abuse medical marijuana, judging from the evidence — but something tells us that this study will not stop the growing clout of the cannabis industry, a $32 billion sector and growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emotional moment an 11-year-old girl broke the news to her father that she’s getting a heart transplant was captured on video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Daddy, I’m getting a heart!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ava was born in 2014 with several heart defects, and was just six days old when she had her first open heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year when she was ten, a sinus infection escalated, pushing her into heart failure—so she was put on the transplant list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ava spent more than 200 days waiting for an organ donor at the Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in March 2025, her mom, Jamie, received the news that Ava would be getting a new heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ava immediately wanted to call her dad, Sean, who was at home with his younger daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_226781" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226781" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-226781" src="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Girl-and-mom-in-hospital-vertical-SWNS.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-226781" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Ava with her doctor – Credit: SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was so excited and couldn’t believe it was actually happening,” Ava recalled later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heart transplant took place that month, performed by pediatric and congenital heart surgeon Dr. Hani Najm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, Ava was able to return home after eight months in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hearing Ava say those words, ‘I’m getting a heart’, was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After everything she’d been through, we were finally one step closer to coming home for good.”&lt;/p&gt;

During this period, the patient may develop complications such as ear infections, diarrhoea, pneumonia, fever, and rashes,” they said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both doctors emphasised the importance of vaccination. “The MR (Measles-Rubella) vaccine, offered free under the government’s Universal Immunisation Program, is highly effective. Children who are vaccinated are unlikely to contract the disease. To eliminate measles in India, a significant majority of children across all regions must be immunised,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/06/550x309/measles_outbreak_1741254341444_1741254349707.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Measles cases are on rise in United States.(Adobe Stock)" title="Measles cases are on rise in United States.(Adobe Stock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Measles cases are on rise in United States.(Adobe Stock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How measles spreads: Know symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles originates in the nose and throat of infected individuals and is highly &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/genesis/experts-say-indian-healthcare-is-prepared-to-manage-fevers-but-must-remain-alert-to-emerging-infectious-threats-101764593783208.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="infectious"&gt;infectious&lt;/a&gt;. The virus spreads through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can linger in the air for up to an hour, making isolation of patients critical,” the doctors explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Measles often starts like the flu, with high fever, fatigue, severe cough, red or bloodshot eyes, and a runny nose. Red rashes usually begin on the head and spread to other parts of the body. Other symptoms may include sore throat, white spots in the mouth, muscle pain, and sensitivity to light,” said Dr Sabnis and Dr Mahajan.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/28/original/Gemini_Generated_Image_eslbxeeslbxeeslb_1761624444940.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Measles is a highly contagious illness caused by a virus.

Vaccinated or previously infected individuals are usually immune. However, new strains of the virus may put everyone at risk,” they said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no cure for measles, and recovery usually takes 10–14 days.

									New research shows the routine shot may reduce Alzheimer’s risk and slow cognitive decline in older adults								&lt;/p&gt;
				&lt;div class="elementor-element elementor-element-27a7d87 elementor-widget elementor-widget-theme-post-content" data-id="27a7d87" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"&gt;
					&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;A routine vaccine that millions of older adults receive to prevent painful shingles outbreaks may offer an unexpected bonus: significant protection against dementia. Recent research has uncovered a compelling connection between the shingles vaccine and reduced risk of cognitive decline, with findings suggesting the shot may not only prevent dementia but also slow its progression in people already facing diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;The discovery emerged from a unique natural experiment in Wales that allowed researchers to conduct rigorous analysis typically only possible in randomized clinical trials. The results have captured the attention of geriatric specialists and neurologists who see potential for a readily available intervention that could impact millions of lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;How researchers discovered the connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;The foundation for these findings came from a shingles vaccine program launched in Wales on September 1, 2013. The program allowed residents aged 79 and older to receive the &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/12/08/trump-vaccine-childhood-immunization/"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, creating distinct groups of vaccine-eligible and vaccine-ineligible individuals based purely on birth date. This setup provided researchers with conditions similar to a randomized trial, where the groups should be essentially identical except for vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Dr. Pascal Geldsetzer, a senior author of the study and assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, emphasized the significance of this natural experiment. The design allowed researchers to draw meaningful conclusions about cause and effect rather than simply observing correlations that might result from other factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;A major study published in April 2025 revealed that individuals who received the shingles vaccine experienced a 20 percent reduction in &lt;a href="https://rollingout.com/2025/10/28/trump-mistakes-dementia-screening-for/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; risk over a seven-year period. This finding alone would have been noteworthy, but follow-up research published in the journal Cell took the implications even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;The vaccine may help those already diagnosed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;The follow-up study analyzed health records to track cognitive decline from earliest signs through late-stage dementia. Researchers discovered that participants who received the shingles vaccine showed lower likelihood of being diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment over the subsequent nine years compared to unvaccinated individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Perhaps even more encouraging, vaccinated people proved significantly less likely to die from dementia after receiving a diagnosis. This suggests the shingles vaccine may play a role in slowing disease progression, offering hope not just for prevention but also for those already facing cognitive challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Geldsetzer noted that the research now provides evidence likely showing a cause-and-effect relationship between shingles vaccination and both dementia prevention and treatment. This distinction between correlation and causation represents a critical advancement in understanding how the vaccine impacts brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Why the vaccine might protect the brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Researchers are actively investigating the mechanisms behind these protective effects. Two primary pathways appear most promising based on current understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;The shingles virus, known scientifically as varicella-zoster, can cause substantial inflammation in the nervous system when it reactivates decades after initially causing chickenpox. This neuroinflammation is thought to contribute to dementia development. By preventing the virus from reactivating, the vaccine may shield the brain from inflammatory damage that accelerates cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Additionally, the vaccine may enhance the immune system’s ability to clear abnormal proteins associated with dementia, particularly those linked to Alzheimer’s disease. This immune boost could help the body address one of the fundamental biological processes underlying cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;Medical experts weigh in&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Geriatric specialists have responded with cautious optimism to these findings. Dr. Zeeshan Khan, chief of geriatrics at Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center, highlighted the profound impact dementia has on patients and their families. He noted that a routine preventative measure already recommended for shingles could have powerful effects on brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Khan also praised the study’s design, which minimized biases frequently encountered in observational research. The quasi-randomized nature of the Wales program eliminated many confounding factors that typically complicate interpretation of vaccine effectiveness studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;Neuropsychologist Dr. Raphael Wald described the findings as further confirmation that the shingles vaccine decreases dementia risk. He emphasized the need for additional investigation to determine whether the immunological response serves as the primary factor in risk reduction, which could inform development of new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="font-claude-response-subheading text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-1.5"&gt;What this means for older adults&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;The emerging evidence linking the shingles vaccine to lower &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/managing-the-risk-of-dementia/risk-factors-for-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; and slower disease progression offers tangible hope for the millions affected by cognitive decline. The findings reinforce the importance of vaccination in older adults while presenting an accessible option for enhancing brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="font-claude-response-body break-words whitespace-normal "&gt;As research continues, scientists may unlock new avenues for dementia prevention and treatment based on understanding how this vaccine protects cognitive function. For now, the message remains clear: a shot already recommended for preventing painful shingles may deliver benefits extending far beyond its original purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

Busy schedules, constant stress and chaotic personal lives have somewhat become the norm. In between demanding jobs, family responsibilities and poor lifestyle choices, health takes a back seat. This includes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sex" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;sex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;ual health; however, it is one area that is constantly overlooked. Most of us are running on fumes by the time we make it to bed, and libidos become collateral damage. While several factors contribute to this, eating the right foods can enhance your sex life. Here are three science-backed foods that may act as aphrodisiacs. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oysters&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oysters are more than a delicacy. They have long been considered an aphrodisiac. This seafood is rich in zinc, a compound linked to increased blood flow. Zinc can regulate testosterone levels and also improve male fertility. A 2018 review found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30009140/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;zinc deficiency can affect testosterone levels.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interestingly, oysters contain more zinc than other foods.

A 2016 study from the University of East Anglia (UEA) and Harvard University, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523121575?via%3Dihub" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;berries are linked to reduced erectile dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. The researchers found that eating foods rich in certain flavonoids is associated with a reduced risk of erectile dysfunction in men, with the greatest benefit seen in those under 70. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anthocyanins found in blueberries, cherries, blackberries, radishes and blackcurrants offered the greatest benefits, even in preventing the condition. The researchers also found that a higher total fruit intake was associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of erectile dysfunction. When flavonoid-rich foods are combined with exercise, the risk is reduced by 21%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Nuts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go nuts, quite literally. Nuts can help improve sexual function. Eat your walnuts, almonds and hazelnuts. A 2019 study from Universitat Rovira i Virgili, published in the journal Nutrients, found that consuming &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/6/1372" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;60 grams of nuts a day improves sexual function&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Yes, that’s right. The researchers found that adding walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds to your diet can improve sexual desire and orgasm quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These foods are not miracle cures, but adding them to your diet may help. To get things going, it is also important to address the risk factors for sexual and erectile dysfunction, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, a lack of physical exercise, stress and an unhealthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.
