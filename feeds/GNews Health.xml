According to &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/beet-juice-lowers-blood-pressure-in-older-people-by-changing-their-oral-microbiome/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Good News Network;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Good News Network&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Exeter followed prior research that had "shown [how] a high nitrate diet can reduce blood pressure … [and] the risk of heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As beetroot juice is rich in nitrates and nutrients that nourish a healthy heart, it is especially significant for those of higher ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"When older adults drank a concentrated 'shot' of beetroot juice twice a day for two weeks, their blood pressure decreased – an effect not seen in a younger group used for comparison," said Good News Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The key difference between age groups was the alteration in the oral biome of subjects under thirty versus those above sixty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By suppressing bacteria that could become harmful, the juice itself changed the makeup of what was in the older test subjects' mouths, and in turn, they "experienced a notable decrease in the mouth bacteria Prevotella … along with an increase in the growth of bacteria known to benefit health, such as Neisseria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This discovery falls in line with previous understandings of how nitrate-heavy foods can positively influence the crucial inner workings of the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Evidence has shown that not only do nitrates help with heart health, but they also provide other benefits such as higher protection from metabolic diseases and more efficient food processing, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6147587/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per the NCBI;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per the NCBI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Studies like this one bring a sense of hope for those looking to maintain the long-term health of their bodies, and as more research goes into &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/eat-cleaner-cheaper-food/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dietary changes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;dietary changes&lt;/a&gt; that people can implement, more pivotal discoveries will arise as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study author Anni Vanhatalo, professor at the University of Exeter, emphasized that "encouraging older adults to consume more nitrate-rich vegetables could have significant long term health benefits," though she made sure to clarify "that if you don't like beetroot, there are many nitrate-rich alternatives like spinach, rocket, fennel, celery and kale."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/hacks-newsletter/?recSjQHScZxzWsTyu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for easy tips to &lt;strong&gt;save more&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;waste less&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQd0ljSmEzbHBGQ2pRU1ZQVHhweGItczBudHZRdUZOWldsOXp0cm1ENGN1dHQ1eWJxSWh6czRRcTBuTy1qRE1rdngxdEdfTWxaUm8zWkhnZHRmbEZMMThtOWk4NExvbEpxRDRLWV9tZ2J1Ni1GdDVST1NYajBtM2thT0lrRmVmSkpuMGhXUXlDUlVVMUNITGxhbmNpWjlsZw</guid></item><item><title>救命！我婆婆带了一位惊喜客人，强迫我离开我的家。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/11/family-advice-in-laws-surprise-allergies.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="19" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjl22xp000o3b79vvvat57s@published"&gt;Recently, my mother-in-law came for a visit. I am seriously allergic to dogs and cats (I wish I weren’t!).&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhl39j3b000d3b79fxxwgg66@published"&gt;My mother-in-law has a Chihuahua, “Chari,” who accompanies her everywhere. She assured us that Chari would be staying with a dog sitter. Well, surprise! My MIL showed up with the dog in tow, claiming he “wouldn’t be able to stand being apart from his Mommy.” I ended up having to stay at my sister’s, and a cleaning service had to be hired to purge the house after my MIL and Chari left.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjl22zk000p3b79f52tyy01@published"&gt;I am furious with my husband for siding with his mother over me. She lives three hours away, not three states, and it wouldn’t have been the end of the world for him to have insisted she go home due to my allergies. He thinks I made too big a deal over the situation, and even that maybe some exposure to the dog might have helped me develop some “immunity!” How can I get it into his head that he needs to support me in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="239" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjl235d000s3b79jru5xfku@published"&gt;I really wish I could get a glass of wine with you and hear about a million more details about your relationship with your mother-in-law, husband, and even this poor, anxious dog. But in the absence of knowing how you feel about these mammals, I’ve developed a conspiracy theory: Is it possible your MIL brought Chari on purpose, knowing you’d have to leave, because she was craving some solo time with her son? That’s exactly the kind of stunt I could see some of today’s overzealous #BoyMom parenting influencers pulling in 20 years when their beloved little princes grow up and get married. If there’s part of you that thinks bringing Chari was a bit of light bioterrorism in service of mother-son time, I’d gently float the idea that your husband makes a solo visit out to his mom soon, or plans another trip with just her. Even if the next visit is still a trip to your house, ask him to make sure to carve out a special activity or meal for just the two of them and inform his mom ahead of time about the plan. He should make the special activity something she’ll definitely want to do, and it shouldn’t allow dogs. It doesn’t sound like your MIL is willing to make accommodations for you, but maybe she’ll make them to visit a museum or attend a play with her son, and you’ll reap the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjl2377000t3b79on2aibkz@published"&gt;Another possibility: Despite what I’m sure were clear explanations about your pet allergy, maybe your MIL didn’t quite comprehend that you would actually have to leave your house to accommodate her. There’s a small part of me that thinks now that she knows she inconvenienced you so deeply, she’d be too embarrassed to ever repeat this behavior. But my guess is she would have checked herself into a pet-friendly hotel or Airbnb immediately if that were the case.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="170" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhl68n3500153b793pocml8o@published"&gt;So you’re right: The bigger issue here is that you need to compromise with your husband. Before the next visit, you two need to get on the same page about what you mean when you say he needs to support you. When you found out she was bringing the dog, was your first suggestion that she turn around and go home? I could see why she and your husband might bristle at that. I’m not sure it’s fair to insist that supporting you meant making her turn right around and go home. But making you leave wasn’t a fair solution either. It sounds like what you might need from him is an apology and an affirmation that he believes you when you say your allergies are real and challenging (sure, &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/the-pros-and-cons-of-allergy-immunotherapy.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;immunotherapy for allergies exists, but it’s not at all a simple process&lt;/a&gt;). And he might need &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;to affirm that you do want to spend time with his mom as long as her visit doesn’t put you at medical risk.&lt;/p&gt;

A pet-friendly accommodation is a glaring third option that doesn’t involve anyone being chased from their house or canceling what I’d imagine was a much-anticipated trip. If there aren’t any near you, a friend, neighbor, or even local vet will know of a dog sitter who will be willing to watch Chari in the future. I wish all four of you many years of stress- and sneeze-free visits ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

As a teenager, Nikki treated me as her own personal maid, chauffeur, and chef.

It regulates blood pressure, metabolism, and overall cardiovascular function. Yet, in modern life, many people go to bed later because of long work hours or time spent on digital devices. Scientists are now learning that when we sleep may be just as important as how much we sleep. While poor or short sleep has long been known to raise the risk of heart problems, recent research has begun to explore whether bedtime itself plays a role. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.709468/full" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;new study published in Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that people who regularly go to bed after midnight on weekdays have a higher risk of heart attack. This discovery suggests that the timing of sleep could directly affect heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How our body clock keeps the heart in rhythm&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human body follows a 24-hour internal clock known as the circadian rhythm. This clock helps control when we feel awake or sleepy and regulates vital functions such as blood pressure, hormone levels, and heart rate. The heart and blood vessels work in line with this natural rhythm, staying more active during the day and resting at night. When people stay up well past midnight, they interfere with this built-in schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over time, this disruption can place extra strain on the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally! Sadhguru’s 5-Step Routine for Deep Rest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Frontiers study, researchers found that people who regularly went to bed late on weekdays were more likely to experience a heart attack. Interestingly, this pattern did not appear on weekends, suggesting that weekday routines, combined with early wake-up times, may increase the heart’s workload. These results show that bedtime can influence heart health independently of sleep duration, highlighting the importance of aligning sleep with the body’s natural rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the research revealed about bedtime and heart risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study examined information from 4,576 adults who took part in the Sleep Heart Health Study, which tracks sleep patterns and cardiovascular outcomes. Participants reported their usual bedtime and wake-up time for both weekdays and weekends. Their bedtimes were grouped into four ranges: before 10:00 pm, between 10:01 pm and 11:00 pm, between 11:01 pm and midnight, and after midnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers followed them for more than ten years to see who developed myocardial infarction, the medical term for heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a clear pattern. Those who went to bed after midnight during weekdays were much more likely to have a heart attack than those who slept between 10:01 pm and 11:00 pm. Even after accounting for other risk factors such as smoking, body weight, high blood pressure, diabetes, alcohol use, and total sleep duration, the link remained strong. People with late weekday bedtimes had about a 63 per cent higher risk of heart attack. Interestingly, going to bed very early, before 10:00 pm, also carried a slightly higher risk, forming a U-shaped pattern where both extremes of bedtime appeared less favourable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why late nights can harm the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons why staying up late might increase heart risk. First, delaying sleep disrupts the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps control blood pressure and supports repair of blood vessels during the night. Low melatonin levels can lead to higher blood pressure and more inflammation in the arteries. Late nights are also often linked to shorter and poorer-quality sleep, reducing the amount of deep rest the body needs to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who stay up late may also adopt habits that harm the heart, such as eating late, being less physically active, and spending long hours exposed to bright screens. These behaviours can increase blood sugar and cholesterol levels, encourage weight gain, and heighten stress hormone activity. Over time, such changes can damage blood vessels and make heart attacks more likely. Laboratory studies have shown that irregular sleep timing raises cortisol, impairs glucose control, and increases blood clotting which are all factors that contribute to cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How regular sleep habits can protect the heart&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that a consistent bedtime may help protect against heart problems. Going to bed around the same time each night supports the body’s internal clock and allows the cardiovascular system to rest and repair properly. Health researchers are beginning to recognise that sleep timing should be considered alongside diet, exercise, and smoking in assessing heart-disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late-night lifestyles have become common in modern society, with technology, shift work, and flexible schedules often pushing people to stay awake longer. This pattern can create “social jet lag”, where a person’s biological clock is constantly out of sync with daily routines. Over time, this misalignment may increase blood pressure, disturb metabolism, and raise the risk of obesity and diabetes, all key contributors to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health experts suggest that improving sleep habits could be a simple but effective way to support heart health. Going to bed at a steady, reasonable hour and getting enough rest may help maintain healthy blood pressure, balance stress hormones, and lower inflammation.

Produced by Roche, Elecsys pTau181 measures the concentration of a specific molecule—a phosphorylated form of the tau protein—in the blood. Tau is one of two proteins, the other being amyloid, that become malformed and accumulate in the brains of patients with certain types of dementia. It is believed that the buildup of these proteins interferes with the communication of brain cells, leading to these patients’ symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The test had already received authorization in July for marketing in Europe and is thus the first early screening system for Alzheimer’s for use in primary care settings approved in the planet’s two major pharmaceutical markets. It is an opener in what should soon become a crowded field, as there are several other tests in advanced stages of testing and approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;How Do Such Tests Work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Elecsys pTau181 looks in the blood plasma for a form of the tau protein that has a phosphate group attached, which is often found in elevated amounts in Alzheimer’s patients. This molecule is an indirect marker of the plaques of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles of tau observed in the brains of patients with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Some other tests have also been approved, though not for early screening. These assess other biomarkers that relate to these two proteins. One test, called Lumipulse and made by the Japanese company Fujirebio, looks at the ratio between another form of phosphorylated tau (pTau217) and a key protein fragment that forms amyloid plaques (amyloid beta peptide 1-42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The bottom line is that these tests offer clues to the probable presence of amyloidosis in the brain, which then needs to be diagnosed with greater accuracy using more invasive tests, such as a PET (positron emission tomography) scan and cerebrospinal fluid analysis by lumbar puncture, considered the clinical gold standard for diagnosing amyloid pathology in living patients. Even these, however, come with some degree of uncertainty; true diagnostic certainty can only be had with a post-mortem dissection of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Why Approve These Tests Now?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In the past, confirmation of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis was not that important, as there were no drugs or therapies that could alter the course of the disease. But with the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alzheimers-drugs-benefits-risks-lecanemab-donanemab/"&gt;approval of new Alzheimer’s monoclonal antibody treatments&lt;/a&gt;, the landscape has changed in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;To use these medicines, you need a way to confirm which patients can benefit. And since the drugs ideally yield the best results when used early on in the disease’s progression, a relatively inexpensive and minimally invasive diagnostic test will be extremely useful. Subjecting all elderly people with suspected symptoms of cognitive decline to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid sampling is impractical, so this is where blood testing for Alzheimer’s comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;Just How Useful Are These Tests?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Elecsys pTau181 is the first test to be approved for use as a community-screening tool. The idea is for it to be administered at the primary care level—so, for instance, by a primary care physician or general practitioner. The test has been shown to have a good “negative predictive value”—that is, it is effective at accurately indicating who &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; have amyloid disease. In settings where the overall prevalence of amyloid disease is low, a negative result from this test is 97.9 percent reliable. This makes it useful for selecting which patients to put forward for further testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The results are similar to those of other tests that have already been approved in recent months, such as Lumipulse from Japan’s Fujirebio, which in trials has shown a negative predictive value of about 97 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;However, there is an important limitation to note: for all blood tests for Alzheimer’s, there tends to be a relatively large proportion of patients (15-30 percent is a common estimate) who fall into a gray area of uncertainty, in which the levels of identified biomarkers do not allow for either a positive or a negative answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOZjdFRXh3cVpfdmhBQ1F0d1F0Ym1va2NscElSMG5kSHBoeTJwNFFSMGxoWVl6X251M00xaDhzbEVNTHBPYnY5X3hHZzNZR2hVazQ1eTZ1a0tTb3hNcHpnQkpYNlk3SFRxdEg5RlhUbnJnQl9pSHh2QWVhMllFeFNkcU9xamp2T29pNDQ1X2hXeFhIWTVLX05Ralc0NjgzVW44eTNyREJlUV8yejBEU29XYXk2OFI3Q015V3ZsdFVscWdyOV9FMzdrVExqcjBrOUhJa2ZN</guid></item><item><title>髋关节屈肌无力导致我腰痛-这是我用来加强它们的三个练习- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/weak-hip-flexors-were-causing-me-backache-these-are-the-three-exercises-i-used-to-strengthen-them</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber supports digestion, heart health and blood sugar control, yet most Americans fall short of daily goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chia seeds, flaxseeds and almonds are top sources, delivering 3–10g of fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts and seeds also offer plenty of protein, minerals and antioxidants to support overall health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Maybe you've been feeling sluggish lately, or your digestion isn't quite right. At your checkup, your healthcare provider brings up fiber—so you do what any health-conscious person would do: start choking down bowls of high-fiber cereal and forcing yourself to eat &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-eat-brussels-sprouts-11801582" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Brussels sprouts with every meal&lt;/a&gt;. A few days in, you're already dreading breakfast and wondering how long you can keep this up.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But what if getting more fiber didn't have to feel like such a chore?

Nuts and seeds pack a surprising amount of fiber—along with healthy fats, plant-based protein and an array of vitamins and minerals that support overall health.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to fiber, chia seeds take the crown. These tiny seeds deliver an impressive 10 grams of fiber in just a 1-ounce serving. “In addition to being packed with fiber, chia seeds are a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/healthy-snacks-that-have-more-calcium-than-a-cup-of-yogurt-11803455" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;surprising source of calcium&lt;/a&gt;, with 14% of the daily value for this nutrient,” says &lt;a href="https://samanthacassetty.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Samantha Cassetty, RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Chia seeds are especially high in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which absorbs water to form a gel-like substance that picks up excess sugar and cholesterol in the gut, supporting blood sugar control and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Their ability to absorb liquid also makes them &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8029350/basic-overnight-oats/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;perfect for overnight oats&lt;/a&gt;, smoothies or chia pudding.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber: 8 grams per 1 ounce (28 grams), per the USDA.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coming in second place, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-flaxseeds-good-for-you-11733695" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flaxseeds are true fiber heavyweights&lt;/a&gt;, packing about 8 grams per ounce. But what really sets flaxseeds apart goes beyond their fiber content. Cassetty notes that flaxseeds are high in lignans, a plant compound with strong anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For better nutrient absorption, choose ground flaxseeds over whole ones—your body can better digest them when they’re ground.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber: 3 grams per 1 ounce (28 grams), per the USDA.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Almonds are popular for a reason—and it’s not just their great taste. Each ounce serving provides 3 grams of fiber along with a wealth of other nutrients. “Almonds stand out for providing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-when-you-consume-vitamin-e-regularly-8685814" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;almost 50% of your daily value for vitamin E&lt;/a&gt;,” says Cassetty. They also contain phytosterols that help to lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you snack on them raw, toss slivered almonds onto salads or use almond butter in recipes, these versatile nuts make it easy to boost your fiber intake.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber: 3 grams per 1 ounce (28 grams), per the USDA.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These vibrant green nuts pack 3 grams of fiber per ounce, but their benefits don't stop there. Cassetty points out that pistachios have 6 grams of protein—the same amount as a hard-boiled egg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With their satisfying crunch and naturally portioned shells, pistachios make an easy, fiber-rich snack you can enjoy on their own or sprinkled over salads and grain bowls.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber: 3 grams per 1 ounce (28 grams), per the USDA.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don't underestimate these small but mighty seeds. Sunflower seeds deliver about 3 grams of fiber per ounce, and they're nutritional powerhouses in other ways too. Cassetty highlights that these seeds are abundant in vitamin E, providing 49% of your daily value.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They also supply 40% of your daily value of selenium, a mineral that plays a key role in DNA repair and antioxidant defense.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sprinkle them on salads, blend them into smoothies or enjoy them as a standalone snack.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pecans deliver just under 3 grams of fiber per ounce and provide notable heart health benefits. In one study, adults with metabolic syndrome who replaced their usual daily snacks with two ounces of pecans experienced reductions in triglycerides as well as total and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_59-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Pumpkin seeds may offer slightly less fiber—about 2 grams per ounce—but they make up for it with an impressive lineup of immune-supporting nutrients. Cassetty notes that pumpkin seeds are an excellent source of key minerals, providing 40% of the daily value (DV) for magnesium, 20% DV for zinc and 14% DV for iron.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These minerals play essential roles in immune function, energy production and muscle health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_66-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Walnuts provide 2 grams of fiber per ounce, but they truly shine for their unique nutritional profile. Cassetty points out that walnuts are the only nut that is high in the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;alpha-linolenic acid&lt;/a&gt; (ALA), a type of plant-based omega-3. They’re also rich in polyphenols and vitamin E, both of which have antioxidant properties. Together, these compounds may reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_68-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Add walnuts to your morning oatmeal or evening yogurt for a fiber boost that supports both your gut and your sleep.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_73-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While technically a legume rather than a true nut, peanuts earn their spot on this list with about 2 grams of fiber per ounce. Unlike other nuts, peanuts are high in protein, with 7 grams per ounce. They’re also rich in anti-inflammatory nutrients—such as magnesium, selenium, vitamin E, monounsaturated fats and polyphenols—that have been linked with a lower risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Cassetty points out that the real reason these seeds stand out is their protein and mineral content—a single serving provides 10 grams of plant protein and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-rich-foods-11772823" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;50% of your daily value for magnesium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_85-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Incorporating nuts and seeds into your daily routine is easier than you might think. Here are some simple ways to add them to your meals and snacks:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_86-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_87-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sprinkle chia or flaxseeds into smoothies, oatmeal or yogurt for a fiber boost&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top salads with almonds, walnuts or pumpkin seeds for added crunch and nutrition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spread nut butter on whole-grain toast or apple slices for a satisfying snack&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use crushed almonds or pecans as a coating for chicken, fish or tofu&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blend cashews into creamy sauces or soups for richness without dairy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use nut or seed butters as a dip for fruit and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add sunflower or pumpkin seeds to baked goods for texture and nutrients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bake with almond flour and nut butters for added fiber and protein&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use chopped nuts or seeds instead of breadcrumbs to coat chicken or fish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_88-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_89-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, keep in mind that while nuts and seeds are nutritious, they're also calorie-dense. Berger recommends sticking with about 1 ounce of nuts or 1–2 tablespoons of seeds, which offers roughly 160–200 calories for a snack. Even that modest serving packs fiber, protein and healthy fats that keep hunger away longer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_90-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_94-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts and seeds are nutritional superheroes. Berger explains they're packed with heart-healthy fats, plant-based protein, antioxidants and key minerals like magnesium, zinc and selenium.

Spinach, which contains alpha-lipoic acid, plays a great role in blood sugar management. The best is that spinach is quite versatile, throw in a handful into a smoothie, saute it with garlic and herbs, for a quick side dish, use it as a base for salads, since it is so low in calories, but high in volume. A study in the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://fathomjournal.org/bfsp8eic-0tam-avsugarn9s-s1lv-ds9i"&gt;Fathom Journa&lt;/a&gt;l, found that one key compound found in nitrate, found in spinach, has been shown to have positive effects on insulin sensitivity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Nov 2025 04:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_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</guid></item><item><title>40岁以下成年人的记忆问题激增，美国大型研究发现- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/memory-problems-are-surging-in-adults-under-40-large-us-study-finds</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The latest study on America's state of mind is in, and it reveals a concerning rise in the share of adults who say they have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clearing-brain-waste-dramatically-improves-memory-in-aging-mice"&gt;problems with memory&lt;/a&gt;, decision-making, or concentration – known collectively as cognitive disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A US team led by University of Utah neurology researcher Ka-Ho Wong found that those aged 18–39 experienced the biggest uptick in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shockingly-common-injury-linked-with-increased-dementia-risk"&gt;cognitive disability&lt;/a&gt; in the past decade, after analyzing survey data from more than 4.5 million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the proportion of US adults reporting serious cognitive difficulties rose from 5.3 percent to 7.4 percent between 2013 and 2023. For those under 40, the rate nearly doubled, jumping from 5.1 percent to 9.7 percent across the same period. People who &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worldwide-review-finds-most-people-with-depression-aren-t-getting-treatment"&gt;reported depression&lt;/a&gt; were excluded from the figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-eye-movements-could-be-hiding-signs-of-a-failing-memory"&gt;Your Eye Movements Could Be Hiding Signs of a Failing Memory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Challenges with memory and thinking have emerged as a leading health issue reported by US adults," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5286"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; vascular neurologist Adam de Havenon, from Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179988" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179988" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CognitiveNumbers.jpg" alt="Cognitive disability" class="wp-image-179988 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CognitiveNumbers.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/CognitiveNumbers-600x323.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179988" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Self-reported cognitive disability rates rose in all age groups except those aged 70 and over. (Wong et al., &lt;em&gt;Neurol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-reported cognitive disability rose across most age groups; however, an upward trend was not observed in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/aging-isn-t-all-bad-some-key-mental-abilities-improve-as-we-get-older"&gt;senior citizens&lt;/a&gt;. Rates in those aged 70 and older actually declined slightly, the researchers found, from 7.3 percent in 2013 to 6.6 percent in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that these difficulties may be becoming more widespread, especially among younger adults, and that social and structural factors likely play a key role," de Havenon &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5286"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those factors include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/having-rich-friends-when-you-re-young-increases-your-income-later-in-life"&gt;socioeconomic status&lt;/a&gt;. Groups with annual incomes under US$35,000 and those with lower educational attainment saw increases in cognitive disability that were larger than the general trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Indian and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/these-indigenous-alaskan-groups-are-linked-to-the-first-humans-to-settle-in-northwest-america"&gt;Alaska Native&lt;/a&gt; adults reported the highest rates of cognitive disability, despite a rise in reported prevalence across all racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These findings suggest we're seeing the steepest increases in memory and thinking problems among people who already face structural disadvantages," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5286"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; de Havenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2022, cognitive disability affects 13.9 percent of adults in the US, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/about/brfss_faq.htm"&gt;annual surveys by the CDC&lt;/a&gt; – making it the most commonly reported disability in those surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_180148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-180148" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/US-Disability-Infographic.jpg" alt="Infographic showing rates of multiple types of disability" class="size-full wp-image-180148" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/US-Disability-Infographic.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/US-Disability-Infographic-433x675.jpg 433w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/US-Disability-Infographic-600x935.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-180148" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;13.9 percent of U.S. adults have a cognitive disability.

The researchers also suggest that increased &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/working-long-hours-is-killing-hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-who-study-finds"&gt;uncertainty about work&lt;/a&gt; among younger adults and greater reliance &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/chatgpt-5-surprising-truths-about-how-ai-chatbots-actually-work"&gt;on digital tools&lt;/a&gt; might be contributing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations here, primarily that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/heres-why-multitasking-gets-trickier-and-even-dangerous-as-we-age"&gt;cognitive problems&lt;/a&gt; were self-reported by phone rather than clinically assessed. Even without specific diagnoses, the numbers are enough to point to a public-health concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to better understand and address the underlying social and economic factors that may be driving this trend," &lt;a href="https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/home/PressRelease/5286"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; de Havenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More research is also needed to understand what's driving the large increase in rates among younger adults, given the potential long-term implications for health, workforce productivity and health care systems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214226"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

New research bolsters the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/2022/study-sleeping-even-small-amount-light-could-harm-heart-health"&gt;well-established&lt;/a&gt; theory linking nighttime light to adverse health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A preliminary analysis set to be presented at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions 2025, starting Friday, suggests that the state of darkness while we sleep plays a crucial role in our overall health. The results link more artificial light at night, also known as artificial nighttime light pollution, with higher brain stress signals, inflamed blood vessels, and greater risk of &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseases.html"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;—a broad term for different heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We know that environmental factors, such as air and noise pollution, can lead to heart disease by affecting our nerves and blood vessels through stress. Light pollution is very common; however, we don’t know much about how it affects the heart,” Shady Abohashem, head of cardiac PET/CT imaging trials at Massachusetts General Hospital and senior author of the yet-unpublished study, said in a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/exposure-to-more-artificial-light-at-night-may-raise-heart-disease-risk?preview=d465&amp;amp;preview_mode=True"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; by the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Artificial nighttime brightness at home&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the observational study, Abohashem and his colleagues reviewed the health data of 466 adults who had undergone the same combined Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scan at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston between 2005 and 2008 to identify stress signals in the brain and evidence of artery inflammation. They also investigated the adults’ exposure to artificial nighttime brightness at their homes via the 2016 New World Atlas of Artificial Night Sky Brightness.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who experienced greater amounts of nighttime artificial light had higher brain stress activity, blood vessel inflammation, and a greater chance of developing heart disease. Unsurprisingly, the risk of heart issues was increased among participants who lived in areas with additional stress factors like significant traffic noise or lower neighborhood income. By the end of 2018, 17% of the adults had experienced significant heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“We found a nearly linear relationship between nighttime light and heart disease: the more night-light exposure, the higher the risk. Even modest increases in night-time light were linked with higher brain and artery stress,” Abohashem explained. The correlation remained even after researchers adjusted for known heart risk factors and other socio-environmental stresses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When the brain perceives stress, it activates signals that can trigger an immune response and inflame the blood vessels,” he added. “Over time, this process can contribute to hardening of the arteries and increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Put the phone down&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what can we do about it? Cities could diminish unnecessary external lighting, and individuals could lessen indoor nighttime light before going to bed, according to Abohashem. That includes screens, which means no more scrolling on TikTok before snoozing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We know too much exposure to artificial light at night can harm your health, particularly increasing the risk of heart disease. However, we did not know how this harm happened,” said Julio Fernandez-Mendoza, who is director of behavioral sleep medicine at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and was not involved in the study. “This study has investigated one of several possible causes, which is how our brains respond to stress. This response seems to play a big role in linking artificial light at night to heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, the study has some limitations, according to the statement. For example, the participants were drawn from a single hospital system, so the group may lack diversity, and the results might not reflect the broader population. Furthermore, because of the nature of an observational study, it can’t prove that the associations are causal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want to expand this work in larger, more diverse populations, test interventions that reduce nighttime light, and explore how reducing light exposure might improve heart health,” Abohashem concluded.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voting behavior in elections is strongly linked to the future risk of death, and is likely a stronger determinant of health than education—considered a key influence on health—suggests research published online in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Epidemiology &amp;amp; Community Health&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


										  

										
																																	&lt;p&gt;Over the past several years, voting in national and local elections has increasingly been seen as a potential social determinant of health—the non-medical factors that influence health and well-being—explain the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And previously published research suggests that voters generally have better health than non-voters, but it's not clear if electoral participation might also be a predictor of future &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/death/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explore this further, the researchers drew on electoral participation information in the 1999 &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/parliamentary+elections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;parliamentary elections&lt;/a&gt; for the entire electorate of Finnish citizens living in mainland Finland and aged at least 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout among this age group was 71.5% for men and 72.5% for women. In all, 3,185,572 people (1,508,824 men; 1,676,748 women) were included in the study and their survival was tracked from 21 March 1999 (election day) to death or the end of 2020, whichever came first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 1999 and 2020, 1,053,483 people died: 95,350 from external causes (accidents, violence and alcohol-attributable causes); 955,723 from other underlying causes; 2,410 people whose cause of death wasn't known were excluded from the final analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not voting was consistently associated with a 73% heightened risk of death from any cause among men and a 63% heightened risk of death among women.&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for education level (basic or unknown; secondary; or tertiary), this reduced to a 64% heightened risk among men and a 59% heightened risk among women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the risk of death between voters and non-voters was larger than it was between those with basic and tertiary level education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The association between voting participation and death was stronger for external causes of death than for other causes. And when adjusted for age, this risk was twice as high among both men and women who didn't vote than it was among those who did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the relative risk of death between voters and non-voters was strongest among men under 50. Among 75 to 94-year-olds, women who didn't vote had a higher risk of death than men who voted, whereas the reverse was true for younger age groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And among men in the lowest 25% of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/household+income/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;household income&lt;/a&gt;, the risk of death associated with not voting was 9–12% higher than it was for other income groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge various limitations to their findings, including that some people might have wanted to vote, but were unable to do so, or simply chose not to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the fact that voting was more strongly associated with the risk of death than educational level "suggests a strong association between voting and mortality, given that a substantial education gradient in mortality is among the most robustly established sociodemographic mortality patterns," they suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;"Voting, as a form of participation, is a type of social capital, which is linked to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/health+benefits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, voting may increase other forms of civic participation," they explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Health problems and related difficulties in functioning may also negatively affect many important prerequisites of participation, including enhancing resources, motivation to &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/vote/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vote&lt;/a&gt;, and political mobilization," they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude, "Information on voting may be useful in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/clinical+settings/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical settings&lt;/a&gt;—for example, abandonment of voting habits may be an early signal of significant health decline—and in monitoring population well-being, health, and health disparities. Additionally, a strong association between voting and mortality raises concerns about equal political representation."&lt;/p&gt;

The findings were published last week in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt; (AHA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is well recognized that human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus, and other viruses can cause cancer; however, the link between viral infections and other non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, is less well understood," lead author Kosuke Kawai, ScD, of UCLA, said in an AHA &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1103173"&gt;&lt;span&gt;news release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stroke 5 times more likely after flu&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 155 studies, published from 1997 to July 2024, were primarily conducted in North America, Europe, and East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self‐controlled case series studies tied flu to a fourfold elevated risk of heart attack (pooled incidence rate ratio [IRR], 4.01) and a fivefold higher risk of stroke during the first 1 month (IRR, 5.01), and cohort studies suggested a higher risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) with hepatitis C infection (RR, 1.27) and stroke (RR, 1.23). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV was consistently linked to a higher risk of CHD (pooled adjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.60) and stroke (RR, 1.45), as was SARS‐CoV‐2 (CHD RR, 1.74; stroke RR, 1.69). Likewise, shingles was associated with a greater risk of CHD (RR, 1.12) and stroke (RR, 1.18). Evidence of an effect of cytomegalovirus, which can cause birth defects, on cardiovascular disease was insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors noted that viral infections trigger the immune system to release substances that lead to inflammation and increase the risk of blood clots, processes that may persist long after initial infection and raise the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The elevated risks for cardiovascular disease risks are lower for HIV, hepatitis C and herpes zoster than the heightened short-term risk following influenza and COVID," Kawai said. "However, the risks associated with those three viruses are still clinically relevant, especially because they persist for a long period of time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to shingles, which affects roughly one in three people in their lifetime, "the elevated risk associated with that virus translates into a large number of excess cases of cardiovascular disease at the population level," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vaccines' role in preventing heart, vascular disease&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study highlights the importance of integrated preventive measures, especially for adults with traditional risk factors for CVD [cardiovascular disease]," the researchers concluded. "Vaccines may play an important role in preventing the risk of CVD."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2020, &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/dcrjournal/abstract/2025/05000/national_trends_in_hospital_admissions,.13.aspx" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by researchers from UCLA and Vanderbilt University reviewed hospital admissions, interventions, and outcomes for early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diverticulitis is commonly found in those over 50 years old and is caused by the inflammation or infection of pouches called diverticula. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pouches form in the wall of the colon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When irritated, people may experience abdominal pain, fever, and changes in bowel movements. &lt;/p&gt;
		
		&lt;p class="article-readmore__content-clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p id="outstream" class="nuk-ad-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Extreme cases could lead to perforation or bowel obstruction, which would require surgery. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People with diverticulitis tend to be diagnosed between the ages of 52 and 64; however, studies show that this age range is changing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reviewing 5.2 million hospitalizations in the National Inpatient Sample, researchers found that the proportion of patients under the age of 50 being admitted with diverticulitis complications increased form 18.5 percent to 28.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that the reason for the drastic increase still remains unclear, however, &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/10531604/dangers-favourite-foods-cancer-lung-issue-death/"&gt;lifestyle changes&lt;/a&gt; in younger people have a massive impact on diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In 2012, a study estimated that about 40 to 53 percent of cases were inheritable, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15253749/young-people-increased-disease-colon-diverticulitis.html" target="_blank" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate="true"&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, a 2025 study found that those who may be genetically predisposed to the complication &lt;a href="https://www.the-sun.com/health/13195259/magic-numbers-reveal-just-how-healthy-you-are/"&gt;but had a low BMI&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t smoke, and ate nutritious foods were less likely to have the condition.&lt;/p&gt;



		
						
						
		



&lt;p&gt;Younger patients with early-onset diverticulitis were found to have lower mortality rates and shorter hospital stays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conversely, younger patients were more likely to need invasive interventions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Early-onset patients are 29 percent more likely to need a colectomy, which removes part or all of the colon. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They are also 58 percent more likely to need the area to be drained. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While younger patients generally have better survival outcomes and shorter hospitalizations, they’re paradoxically more likely to need invasive interventions,” Lead author and fourth-year medical student at UCLA Shineui Kim wrote in the study. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This suggests their disease may be more aggressive or that treatment approaches differ based on patient age and overall health status.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kim noted that more research needs to urgently be conducted to investigate the cause of the rise in early-onset diverticulitis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2017, 62 babies and toddlers were treated with a genetic therapy for severe combined immunodeficiency, known colloquially as the “Bubble Boy disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, GNN &lt;a href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/ucla-gene-therapy-breakthrough-children-no-immune-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the results of the trial—that by 2019, 95%, or all but two of the young patients, showed complete immune system reconstruction. Now, the long-term follow-up results are in—still 95% effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The durability of immune function, the consistency over time and the continued safety profile are all incredibly encouraging,” &lt;a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/gene-therapy-delivers-lasting-immune-protection-children-rare-disorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the study’s senior author, Donald Kohn, MD, a pediatric transplant physician at Univ. of California LA, where the trial was conducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA-SCID, is caused by mutations in the ADA gene, which creates an enzyme essential for immune function. For children with the condition, day-to-day activities like going to school or playing with friends can lead to dangerous, life-threatening infections. If untreated, ADA-SCID can be fatal within the first two years of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1984, SCID become suddenly well-known in America because of “the boy in the bubble,” David Vetter, who received a special spacesuit from NASA to allow him to leave his total medical isolation. Despite this, Vetter passed away from an infection at age 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gene therapy method involves first collecting some of the child’s blood-forming stem cells in their bone marrow, which have the potential to create all types of blood and immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, using an approach developed by the research team at UCLA with help from the UK’s Great Ormond Street Hospital and University College London, a new copy of the ADA gene is delivered into the stem cells by a modified lentivirus, or “viral vector.” The corrected cells are then returned to the child’s body, where they are intended to produce a continual supply of healthy immune cells capable of fighting infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Between all three clinical trials, 50 patients were treated, and the overall results were very encouraging,” said Kohn back in 2021. “All the patients are alive and well, and in more than 95% of them, the therapy appears to have corrected their underlying immune system problems.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brand new study, also &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502754" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in the New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, represents the largest and longest follow-up of a gene therapy of this kind to date, with 474 total patient-years of follow-up data—including five patients who received the therapy a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 59 patients successfully treated, immune function has remained stable beyond the initial recovery period, with no treatment-limiting complications reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With support from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the UCLA team is now working to complete the steps necessary to apply for FDA approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to have this therapy FDA-approved within two to three years,” Kohn said. “The clinical data strongly supports approval—now we need to demonstrate that we can manufacture the treatment under commercial pharmaceutical standards.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When GNN originally reported on the 2021 study, a slide of photos was released of 6 of the children treated, taken at various times between 2012 and 2017. Accompanying the new study are slides of the same children, not necessarily &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; grown up, but grown up, and living their best healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11-year-old Eliana Nachem of Fredericksburg, Virginia, is starting sixth grade with dreams of becoming an artist. It’s a remarkably ordinary life that once seemed impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Eliana was diagnosed with ADA-SCID at 3 months old in 2014, she lived in complete medical isolation. No pets, no contact with the outside world, with HEPA air filters running constantly and all food and toys sterilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had to get rid of our dog and cat, she couldn’t go outside, and I had to stop breastfeeding,” her mother, Caroline, recalled. “Formula had to be consumed within an hour or thrown out. Everything that might harbor germs was dangerous to her.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2014, at 10 months old, Eliana received her corrected cells at UCLA. Caroline and Jeff described watching the infusion as their daughter’s “rebirth”—her own genetically modified cells carrying the promise of a normal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decade later, that promise has been fulfilled. Despite some early complications during her immune system’s recovery, Eliana has thrived, attending public school, playing basketball and living the unrestricted childhood her parents once could only dream of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tobacco remains the leading preventable cause of cancer death in the U.S., despite a dramatic decline in smoking, a new American Cancer Society report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/cancer/lung-cancer-2665626923.html" target="_blank"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt; deaths are linked to tobacco, data from the inaugural release of the American Heart Association's &lt;a href="https://ustobaccoatlas.cancer.org/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Tobacco Atlas&lt;/a&gt; states.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's even though cigarette smoking among adults cratered from 42% in 1965 to just 11% in 2023, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quit rates also have skyrocketed, with a record 62% of smokers trying to &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/drug-center-wl/what-are-quit-smoking-programs-and-how-can-they-help-you" target="_blank"&gt;drop the habit&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, the reports says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, smokers are shunning the low-dose CT chest scans that are recommended for lung cancer screening, results show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 18% of eligible current or former smokers were up to date with screening in 2022 -- such screening can catch cancers early and improve survival odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The &lt;a href="https://tobaccoatlas.org/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Tobacco Atlas&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful tool showcasing not only the toll that tobacco has taken on the U.S., but also the immense progress public health gains have made over the past decades," lead report editor &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/nigar-nargis-bio.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nigar Nargis&lt;/a&gt;, senior scientific director of tobacco control research at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since the landmark 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on tobacco, millions of lives have been saved by tobacco control, but the scale of the epidemic demands our continued attention and support," Nargis added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ACS recommends annual lung cancer screening for adults 50 to 80 who smoke or used to smoke and have a 20-year or greater pack-year smoking history. A pack year is equal to smoking one pack per day for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new atlas maps U.S. tobacco use and control efforts at national and state levels, the ACS said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the report found that lung cancer screening rates are lowest in Southern States, where the burden of lung cancer is greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of tobacco cessation aids also remains lowest in the South and Midwest, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. Tobacco Atlas is more than a report - it is a call to action. It reminds us that progress is possible, but not inevitable. It requires bold leadership, equitable policies, and unwavering commitment from every sector of society," &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/about-us/who-we-are/executive-leadership/william-dahut-bio.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. William Dahut&lt;/a&gt;, chief scientific officer at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other findings include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 33% of people who use tobacco also use e-cigarettes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1.6 million youth use e-cigarettes, with 90% preferring flavored products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racial minorities, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those with lower income and limited education face higher tobacco-related burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While we have made significant strides in reducing smoking prevalence and expanding access to evidence-based cessation resources, we remain deeply concerned about persistent disparities in tobacco use and tobacco-related disease," senior author &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/ahmedin-jemal-bio.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ahmedin Jemal&lt;/a&gt;, senior scientific vice president of surveillance, prevention and health service research at the American Cancer Society, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These disparities are particularly pronounced in states with weak tobacco control policies and among populations with lower socioeconomic status, and within communities historically targeted by the tobacco industry," Jemal said. "This report brings these inequities into sharp focus and underscores the urgent need for strengthening state and federal tobacco control policies, as well as targeted interventions."&lt;/p&gt;

We know when cold and allergy meds will fly off the shelves. So why not seasonal depression? For the fourth year, &lt;a href="https://www.thriveworks.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thriveworks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Thriveworks&lt;/a&gt; has analyzed Google search trends and weather data to pinpoint when seasonal depression hits hardest, giving people a chance to get ahead of it with preventative care or treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the pattern is holding: Seasonal depression is expected to peak in the third week of November. That’s when searches for seasonal depression historically spike. And true to form, search interest already climbed 125% from mid-August to late September (Aug. 10-Sept. 28)—the typical seasonal ramp-up as days get shorter and temperatures drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Is Seasonal Depression?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the research, let’s clarify what seasonal depression means. Officially, it’s called &lt;a href="https://thriveworks.com/help-with/seasonal-affective-disorder-sad/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seasonal affective disorder;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt; (SAD), and it’s a type of depression that follows a seasonal pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seasonal depression describes episodes of major depressive disorder that occur at a specific time of year—most commonly fall and winter,” explains Laura Harris, a licensed clinical mental health counselor at Thriveworks. “The key characteristic is that symptoms appear during a particular season and then resolve when that season ends.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Common Symptoms to Watch For&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of seasonal depression match those of other types of depression. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet the diagnostic criteria for seasonal depression, symptoms must resolve at the end of the seasonal period. For example, someone might develop symptoms at the beginning of fall and then see them conclude at the start of spring. They must also experience this seasonal depressive pattern for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When Does Seasonal Depression Peak?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal was to understand exactly when seasonal depression might reach its peak this year to better help those who suffer from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By knowing how seasonal triggers affect you and when they typically hit, you can plan ahead,” says Heidi Faust, a licensed clinical social worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy? Get more done during your good months, and set yourself up for success during the hard ones. “This might mean scheduling important appointments with reminders during the fall and winter months—things like annual checkups or therapy sessions,” Faust explains. “You can also build in activities that help counter seasonal depression, like regular social plans or outdoor time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google search data for “seasonal depression” over the last five years (U.S. searches only) was analyzed to predict this year’s peak. The pattern is consistent: Searches spike in mid-November, year after year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Line graph showing Google search interest for seasonal depression from 2018-2025, with annual peaks in November ranging from 48 to 100, and 2025 projected peak of 77 on November 16. - Thriveworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Seasonal Depression Getting Worse?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a comparison of the eight-week time period from Aug. 10 to Sept. 28 for “seasonal depression” search data for the last six years to gain insights into this year’s peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past six years, there has been steady growth in search interest for the term “seasonal depression,” indicative of expanded awareness of the affliction. Between the years of 2019 and 2025, search interest for this topic has grown at an average annual rate of 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comparison of the eight-week buildup period revealed that search interest in seasonal depression followed its typical seasonal pattern, increasing 125% from mid-August to late September as fall approached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Bar chart showing annual average Google search interest for seasonal depression from 2019-2025, demonstrating steady growth from 31.6 to 32.6, with a peak of 36.6 in 2023. - Thriveworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Connection Between Temperature Drops and Seasonal Depression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s Google Trends analysis also showed where search interest for “seasonal depression” was the highest over the last five years. The top 10 metros are geographically diverse but share a common thread: dramatic temperature shifts in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The 10 U.S. Cities Where Seasonal Depression Hits Hardest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Idaho Falls, Idaho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrisonburg, Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Springfield, Massachusetts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt Lake City, Utah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syracuse, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missoula, Montana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ottumwa, Iowa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowling Green, Kentucky&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binghamton, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utica, New York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then looked at weather data, including average monthly temperatures, for these 10 metros. The team discovered that throughout the months of September, October, November, and December—when seasonal depression tends to peak—these top 10 cities experience an average temperature drop of 27.95 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Bar chart comparing average high and low temperatures from September through December for the top 10 cities with highest seasonal depression search interest, showing an average temperature drop of 27.95 degrees. - Thriveworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;This aligns with the Google Trends research, showing that search interest peaks between October and November with consistently high search volume through mid-December. The data suggests that rapid seasonal changes—both temperature drops and&lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:decreasing daylight hours;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; decreasing daylight hours&lt;/a&gt;—drive the spike. Most of these top 10 cities are in the northern U.S., where fall brings both dramatic temperature shifts and significant daylight loss, which together contribute to seasonal depression symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Actually Helps With Seasonal Depression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Hanselman, a board-certified psychiatric nurse practitioner at Thriveworks, recommends a few actions that can help you manage symptoms of depression during seasonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start With Environmental Changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20364651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:light therapy box;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;light therapy box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; first thing in the morning.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for 20-30 minutes of light exposure within the first hour of waking up. Position the lightbox at eye level, about 16-24 inches from your face, while you have breakfast or check email. Morning light exposure helps reset your circadian rhythm and supports serotonin production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get outside before noon, even on cloudy days.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/seasonal-affective-disorder-bring-on-the-light" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natural daylight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natural daylight&lt;/a&gt;—even through clouds—is significantly brighter than indoor lighting and helps regulate melatonin production. A 15-minute morning walk exposes you to light that indoor environments simply can’t replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Build Daily Habits That Protect Your Mood&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wake up at the same time every day—yes, even weekends.&lt;/strong&gt; Your &lt;a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/fact-sheets/Pages/circadian-rhythms.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:circadian rhythm controls serotonin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;circadian rhythm controls serotonin production&lt;/a&gt;, and inconsistent wake times disrupt this system. A stable wake time naturally regulates your sleep-wake cycle within &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:two to three weeks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;two to three weeks&lt;/a&gt;, even if your bedtime varies. Rising at the same time every day can naturally stabilize a variable bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body in ways that feel good.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s a YouTube yoga class, a walk with the dogs, joining a fitness class, or taking the stairs, it all counts. Physical activity supports mood regulation, but the key is consistency over intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with people daily, even in small ways.&lt;/strong&gt; Seasonal depression often comes with the urge to isolate, which can worsen symptoms. Daily social contact—whether it’s dinner with family, helping a neighbor, or simply a text to friends—helps counter the &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/social-isolation-loneliness-older-adults-pose-health-risks" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:loneliness-depression cycle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;loneliness-depression cycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit alcohol and other substances.&lt;/strong&gt; While it can be tempting to think that a drink or two will ease your distress, substance use typically &lt;a href="https://journals.healio.com/doi/10.3928/00485713-20240913-03" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:worsens existing depression symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;worsens existing depression symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. If you use substances regularly, check with a professional before stopping on your own to make sure you have the support you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When Symptoms Hit, Use These Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get it down on paper.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://thriveworks.com/blog/journaling-is-the-ultimate-self-help-tool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journaling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Journaling&lt;/a&gt; helps you externalize what’s happening internally, making patterns more visible and feelings more manageable. Planning out your week on a calendar and scheduling at least one enjoyable activity daily can also help reduce overwhelm and increase joy. And if you’re overwhelmed by tasks, try writing a to-do list and crossing off one to two things daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build a coping tools box.&lt;/strong&gt; Fill it with things that help ground you: photos of happy times, a favorite playlist, a list of grounding techniques, a plan for gentle movement, or a coloring book. Having these tools ready makes them easier to reach for when you need them most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When to See a Therapist for Seasonal Depression&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to practicing the above strategies, it’s important to seek professional help. “Come see us,” says Hanselman. “Meet with a mental health provider to discuss what options are available to make your symptoms more manageable, whether that’s medication, therapy, or a combination of both.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive behavioral therapy is an evidence-based approach to treating depression. Within this modality, clients are taught to identify and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviors. The role of the therapist is to teach skills that help positively align the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing symptoms of seasonal depression, please reach out for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thriveworks.com/help-with/research/seasonal-depression-peak/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This story;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was produced by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thriveworks.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Thriveworks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thriveworks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and reviewed and distributed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://hubs.la/Q03klgSR0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stacker;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stacker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 18:18:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9zMXhvZC1LYjZwczAyaWZnR09GMzVBNzkzajJzNW5mY0VyUVRUalNZd0JIbGJHdXNCNHZCTEg3V2E3RHpDWXNUTzh4UUxoUlo0cFVhSmF3bWMteFZWZ3EzemkwTlFnb1poQnBiSnoyTDdvQ1IxUXlRQkJ1dw</guid></item><item><title>培根屁股上的癌症警告案例-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/the-case-for-a-cancer-warning-on-your-bacon-butty-268404</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A group of scientists in the UK recently demanded that bacon and ham products carry health warnings similar to those on cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These experts argue that these meats, which are often preserved with chemicals called nitrites, pose a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/cancer-risk-6439"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; that successive UK governments have failed to address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/24/scientists-demand-cancer-warnings-bacon-ham-uk"&gt;They are urging&lt;/a&gt; the government to act on growing evidence that these foods can increase the risk of cancer, particularly &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/colon-cancer-4369"&gt;colon (bowel) cancer&lt;/a&gt;. This type of cancer &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bowel-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-under-50s-heres-what-might-explain-the-trend-246447"&gt;is rising&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;especially among young people&lt;/a&gt;, for reasons that remain &lt;a href="https://www.theconversation.com/appendix-cancer-rising-among-younger-generation-new-study-258607"&gt;unclear&lt;/a&gt; despite growing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37105987/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; into potential causes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been nearly a decade since the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified processed meat as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat"&gt;group 1 carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;, meaning there is strong evidence it can cause cancer. That places it in the same category as &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/tobacco"&gt;tobacco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-asbestos-exposure-continues-to-be-a-dire-health-risk-25-years-after-it-was-banned-232426"&gt;asbestos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the UK government has faced mounting pressure to regulate or ban carcinogenic preservatives used in many processed meats such as bacon and ham. These preservatives, known as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35277025/"&gt;nitrites&lt;/a&gt;, are added to keep meat looking fresh and pink, enhance flavour and prevent spoilage. But they are now &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/what-to-know-about-foods-with-nitrates-and-nitrites.h00-159694389.html"&gt;implicated&lt;/a&gt; in tens of thousands of cancer cases every year in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-react-class="InstagramEmbed" data-react-props='{"url":"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQMoSh7DVbW","accessToken":"127105130696839|b4b75090c9688d81dfd245afe6052f20"}'&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger comes from the way nitrites behave once eaten. Inside the body, they can turn into compounds called nitrosamines, which are potent carcinogens that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10003415/"&gt;damage DNA&lt;/a&gt;, the genetic material that controls how cells grow and divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These nitrosamines can attach themselves to DNA in the liver, forming &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36902118/"&gt;DNA adducts&lt;/a&gt;, which are small chemical bonds that stick to the genetic material and distort its structure. This damage can cause genetic errors that, over time, build up and allow cells to divide uncontrollably, forming tumours, particularly &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4339287/"&gt;in the colon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ourcancerstories.com/colorectal-cancer/cancer-biology/nitrosamines"&gt;Nitrosamines&lt;/a&gt; can also trigger stress within cells by creating harmful molecules called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9105260/"&gt;reactive oxygen species&lt;/a&gt;, which cause additional &lt;a href="https://ijbc.ir/article-1-1681-en.pdf"&gt;DNA damage&lt;/a&gt;. This combination of oxidative stress and genetic instability can help cancer develop and spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Scientific consensus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts estimate that nitrites in processed meats have caused around &lt;a href="https://www.gbnews.com/health/cancer-news-ministers-cancer-bacon-labour"&gt;54,000 cases of colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the UK over the past ten years. Since the IARC classification in 2015, the scientific consensus supporting this link has only grown stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent studies continue to confirm a clear association between eating processed meat and an &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455534/"&gt;increased&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30183083/"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455534/"&gt;colorectal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26143683/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Other research has extended these concerns to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8985652/"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, finding that women who eat processed meat weekly have a significantly higher &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40902216/"&gt;risk&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The greatest risk comes from meats treated with nitrites. In response, the EU has &lt;a href="https://www.merieuxnutrisciences.com/new-reduced-limits-for-the-use-of-nitrites-and-nitrates-as-food-additives/"&gt;tightened regulations&lt;/a&gt; by reducing permitted levels of nitrites in processed meats. The EU aims to lead the way in food safety and cancer prevention by encouraging the use of safer alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Industry groups of food manufacturers that oppose nitrite bans argue that removing them could make food less safe by increasing the risk of bacterial contamination. Many scientists and food safety experts disagree. With modern refrigeration and hygiene standards, they say, it is entirely possible to produce safe, long-lasting cured meats without nitrites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European producers already sell nitrite-free &lt;a href="https://digestivecancers.eu/not-all-processed-meats-are-linked-with-cancer-study-says/"&gt;meats&lt;/a&gt; at scale, with no recorded outbreaks of food poisoning linked to such products for decades. This challenges the claim that nitrites are essential for food safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food scientists generally believe innovation can protect public health while maintaining quality and taste. The debate, however, goes beyond food technology. It raises broader questions about how governments balance consumer safety, industry interests and public health priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A call for preventive action&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advocates for reform say the government should take stronger responsibility by phasing out harmful additives and improving food labelling so consumers can make informed choices. They argue that the UK now lags behind the EU in food safety standards after Brexit, where stricter controls on nitrites have already been introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a public health perspective, dietary carcinogens such as nitrites represent a preventable cause of cancer. Reducing exposure could significantly lower the national cancer burden and ease pressure on healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diet plays a key role in &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; and in related conditions such as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9857053/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;. Cutting down on eating processed meats, and supporting safer production methods, would be a major step forward for both personal and public health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The message from researchers is clear. Processed meats containing nitrites pose a significant and well-documented cancer risk. With growing scientific evidence and public awareness, there is now real pressure on policymakers to act. Banning or phasing out these carcinogenic additives, introducing cancer warnings on packaging and supporting producers to switch to safer alternatives could save thousands of lives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp2os000o3b79gikeuv1x@published"&gt;Over the past year, I’ve purposefully lost a lot of weight. I did it mostly for health reasons (I was borderline diabetic, and have now reversed it, which is great), but I would be lying if there wasn’t some aesthetic desired mixed up in all of this as well. I love how I look now—except for one big problem.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjq0vvo000d3b79hy5aq81f@published"&gt;I have so much loose skin on my arms and my boobs! My boobs are completely deflated. So I like how I look in clothes but hate how I look naked—and am especially insecure now as I meet men for hookups and flings. I don’t think I need to warn them, but I feel like they must notice. I can’t help but think my body is a huge turnoff once the clothes come off. Where do I go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp2yp000s3b79dzj8mocw@published"&gt;Patience, combined with the kind of lifestyle that helps reduce the risk of diabetes, might help you more than you think. Your skin might become less loose over time (&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/obesity/loose-skin-after-weight-loss"&gt;putting on some muscle&lt;/a&gt; can help), and you may find you start to care less. If you’re still dissatisfied in another year, a dermatologist or plastic surgeon can offer you several options. But I suggest you give yourself some time to see what changes in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhjnp30h000t3b796xjqfs5x@published"&gt;It’s important to know &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2500v087xo"&gt;that you aren’t alone&lt;/a&gt;. I’m sure there’s something to be said for the power of knowing other people are having the same insecurities. But I bring this up to point out that because your experience isn’t super uncommon, the men you’re having flings with have probably encountered other naked women with similar skin. There absolutely are people in the world who will zero in on the physical details their partners are uncomfortable with, and some will even point those details out verbally, but those people are pretty rare. Anecdotally speaking, the men who are actually having a lot of hookups with multiple partners tend to be focused on the pleasure they’re experiencing and giving, or if anything, a bit concerned about their own characteristics they wish they could change. And, as strange as this may sound, straight men often appreciate or even fetishize certain appearance aspects that most women criticize about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

At all price points and in almost every imaginable aesthetic, there are bras that provide great support with sheer fabrics, bras that leave your nipples accessible, and bolero-style tops that cover only the shoulders and arms. Your best course of action will be to visit a few shops in person, as it’s infinitely more difficult to find the right fit for lingerie than it is for shirts or pants. If that’s not possible, lurking &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/comments/16kygsb/good_bras_for_saggy_breasts_after_extensive/"&gt;the ABraThatFits subreddit&lt;/a&gt; can help you get an idea of what brands and styles might work for you, and the community is often happy to help posters who are willing to share their measurements. In the event that you get lucky and find a plethora of options that appeal to you, though, be choosy, as—to reiterate—your body might continue to change pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

But hookup culture is accurately critiqued as being fairly superficial and usually too fast-paced for establishing that kind of trust. So, know that you can always leave the lights low, and—if a partner is having erectile difficulties—stay open to the likelihood that it has absolutely nothing to do with you, much less your body.&lt;/p&gt;

We took a break early in our relationship for about a year because of unrelated life events, but because of the circumstances, I wasn’t really able to explore my newly realized sexuality. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/02/cheating-grindr-messages-husband-advice.html"&gt;I only hooked up with one guy during that period and it wasn’t super great, honestly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Dana Ellis Hunnes, a senior clinical dietitian at UCLA Health, says her local grocery store often stocks more non-dairy milk options than dairy ones. She’s tried various options, including a brief phase with coconut milk (“It was too creamy and too watery at the same time”). Now, she enjoys &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/19/oat-milk-rises-to-top-as-britains-preferred-plant-based-drink" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;oat milk&lt;/a&gt;, which adds the right amount of creaminess to her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The best choice depends on individual needs and preferences, says Hunnes. One person might want to add more protein to their diet, while another might be looking to increase their calcium intake. Flavor and mouthfeel are also important considerations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While dairy milk remains the most popular option in the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/402717/cow-milk-increase-america-dairy-plant-milks" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/01/full-fat-milk-sales-rise-uk-shoppers-leave-low-calorie-options" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, alternatives are here to stay. Here’s what experts say about how to select the right one for your lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-pick-your-alternative-milk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to pick your alternative milk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adults who use alternative milks do so for various reasons, including pursuing a plant-based diet, reducing their &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt; or managing lactose intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The question of ‘what’s healthy or not?’ is a personal one,” says Abigail Johnson, an assistant professor and associate director of the Nutrition Coordinating Center at the University of Minnesota School of Public &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;. “You need to think about what nutrients you need and consider the milk that can best add those to your diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Johnson is the lead author of a 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672%2824%2900269-7/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; that assessed the nutrient content of plant-based milks available in the United States. The study, which examined 219 plant-based milk alternatives from 21 brands, found that these alternatives were generally lower in protein and saturated fatty acids than dairy milk. Nutrients are often added to help alternative milks compete with dairy milk; 70% of the products were fortified with calcium and vitamin D, and other &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows alternative milks are sometimes also fortified with vitamins A and B12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="3a239e7b-b6c6-43d9-b507-7a5723d9eba0" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Checking the label is important when determining which product is right for you. &lt;/span&gt; Photograph: SolStock/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Adults likely don’t need to choose an alternative milk that matches dairy milk’s nutrient profile exactly, because they get those nutrients from other parts of their diet – unless they are especially concerned about their calcium intake, explains Dr Joan Sabate, a professor and executive director of the Center for Nutrition, Lifestyle and Disease Prevention at Loma Linda University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Checking the label is important when determining which product is right for you. The study found that the nutrient content of alternative milks varied. For instance, soy milk brands can contain different amounts of protein. “You can’t just pick a plant-based milk off the shelf and assume it’s going to meet your calcium needs,” says Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hunnes does “strongly recommend that people try to go for the unsweetened varieties” to minimize their sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“If someone is trying to get more protein, but with as minimal amount of sugar as possible, I might suggest they go for unsweetened pea protein milk or unsweetened soy milk,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For most people, alternative milks will only make up a small part of their overall diet, says Hunnes. With that in mind, these milks “won’t make or break someone’s healthfulness”, says Hunnes. “People should focus on what kind they like best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="do-alternative-milks-contain-seed-oils" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Do alternative milks contain seed oils?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Because many alternative milks lack fat, manufacturers may add seed oil to give the liquids a smooth taste and consistency. Seed oils may also be used as emulsifiers to prevent ingredient separation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Experts say&lt;/a&gt; research does not support claims that seed oils are toxic or drive chronic disease. But claims like &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/07/nx-s1-5453769/nutrition-canola-rfk-seed-oils-soybean" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Maha figurehead&lt;/a&gt; Robert F Kennedy Jr’s – that Americans are “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/13/robert-f-kennedy-jr-claims-seed-oils-are-poisoning-us-heres-why-hes-wrong" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;unknowingly poisoned&lt;/a&gt;” by these products – have led some consumers to avoid them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="fcb98fd8-99ee-48ba-b445-e7154eefa4cd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":16,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"RFK Jr says they are poisoning us, influencers call them unnatural – but what is the truth about seed oils?","elementId":"fcb98fd8-99ee-48ba-b445-e7154eefa4cd","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/29/rfk-jr-says-they-are-poisoning-us-influencers-call-them-unnatural-but-what-is-the-truth-about-seed-oils"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some seed oils can be pro-inflammatory if consumed in very high amounts, explains Hunnes, but the amount of seed oil in some alternative milks isn’t enough to warrant concern, since people are likely to consume only half to a full cup daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unless people are drinking a half a gallon of these non-dairy milks a day, it’s not something I would be concerned about,” says Hunnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Research also suggests plant-derived oils may mitigate cardiovascular disease risk factors, says Johnson. “There’s not necessarily anything wrong with wanting to avoid seed oils and emulsifiers, but some perceived risks might not be accurate,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies generally show that these oils are associated with lower mortality than butter, and experts have &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/the-evidence-behind-seed-oils-health-effects" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; that the purported adverse effects of seed oils have been conflated with the unhealthy foods they are sometimes used in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-each-alternative-milk" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;What are the pros and cons of each alternative milk?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soy milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Johnson’s study found that soy-based products were most nutritionally similar to dairy milk. This is why Sabate recommends soy milk over other alternatives for children. It is also so similar to dairy milk in that it is the only alternative &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/milk-and-plant-based-milk-alternatives-know-nutrient-difference" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; in the dairy section of the US dietary guidelines for Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Soy also has various beneficial, naturally occurring &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772502222001068" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;chemical compounds&lt;/a&gt;, says Sabate. These can support heart, kidney and liver health, she says. These include isoflavones, which are structurally similar to estrogen. This similarity may be why soy milk is linked to a lower &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/does-eating-soy-increase-estrogen-and-cause-breast" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;risk of breast cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/2021/10000/the_women_s_study_for_the_alleviation_of_vasomotor.12.aspx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;reduced hot flashes&lt;/a&gt; (although the evidence is mixed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This similarity has led to a false assumption that drinking soy milk could have feminizing effects on men, despite &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20378106/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19524224/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; showing that’s not true. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890623820302926" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; of 38 clinical studies found no adverse effects of soy on men. In one extremely &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9593161/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rare case&lt;/a&gt;, in which a man’s breasts grew after drinking soy milk, he was consuming 1.2 liters of daily for three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-25" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to a 2022 UC Davis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/87559129.2025.2450263#abstract" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, it is the most popular alternative after almond milk, and demand is growing. This may be because oat milk’s sensory qualities are similar to dairy milk; oat milk also often &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contains more sugar&lt;/a&gt; than almond, soy, pea and coconut milks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It also contains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;phytates&lt;/a&gt;, compounds with antioxidant properties that can help prevent bone loss and kidney stone formation. Some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128169384000033" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that oat milk may be an appropriate dairy substitute for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Oat milk also has &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more fiber&lt;/a&gt; than many alternative milks, except for rice milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Phytates can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10534225/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;impair&lt;/a&gt; the absorption of iron, zinc and calcium; however, consuming oat milk along with a balanced, nutrient-rich diet should minimize any adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4},"elementId":"7275ee59-782e-4b79-8ed8-715a8a11204f","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="7275ee59-782e-4b79-8ed8-715a8a11204f" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almond milk: &lt;/strong&gt;Those looking for something low-calorie or who are concerned about their blood sugar might want to try unsweetened almond milk, says Hunnes. It might also appeal to consumers who prioritize foods with fewer ingredients; there’s &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/creqge8xgx4o" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising interest&lt;/a&gt; in simpler ingredient lists, so consumers can better understand the health impacts of a product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That said, 2023 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that almond milk has less protein than cashew, hemp, pea and soy milk. It has more protein than coconut and rice milk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Production of almond milk also involves more &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/#Sec6" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;water use&lt;/a&gt; than other plant-based milks – though dairy production still uses significantly more water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coconut milk:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Coconut milk has high levels of saturated fat, and is thus often marketed as having a mouthfeel similar to whole milk, explains Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="42941aca-a35c-44f5-b88e-a8e8e21fff10" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;There’s some evidence that coconut milk contains antioxidative compounds.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: jayk7/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Critically, the American Heart Association &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; limiting saturated fats to less than 6 % of your total calories, so experts &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/the-great-milk-debate-of-2024-which-milk-is-healthier" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;More research on coconut milk is needed to understand its health effects.

Because it is very low in protein – one &lt;a href="https://foodandhealth.ucdavis.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/IIFH-GSM-Plant-Based-Milk-Market-Report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;serving&lt;/a&gt; may contain 0.9 grams of protein, compared with 2.4 grams in oat milk and 1.7 grams in almond milk – experts recommend combining it with other protein-rich foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Rice milk may appeal to some because it’s low in saturated fat and cholesterol, and it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996919308580" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;least allergenic&lt;/a&gt; of milk alternatives. It’s sometimes the choice of athletes and others with high energy needs because it contains &lt;a href="https://www1.racgp.org.au/newsgp/clinical/cow%E2%80%99s-milk-vs-the-alternatives-which-is-best" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;All rice can &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/risa.70008" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;potentially&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18385862/#:~:text=Abstract,food%20regulations%20in%20this%20respect." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;contain arsenic&lt;/a&gt; because rice plants absorb the element from the soil. There are no dietary limits for arsenic in rice milk, but some reports &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2F1MDzyW55pg97Tdpp7gqLN/should-i-be-concerned-about-arsenic-in-my-rice" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;advise caution&lt;/a&gt; around intake for children. Because young children eat three times more food for their size than adults do, they are more likely to take in higher amounts of inorganic arsenic from their diet. For instance, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/chemicals/arsenic.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that infant rice cereals not contain more than 100 parts per billion of inorganic arsenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There’s a need for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4779445/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more research&lt;/a&gt; to know the health effects of consuming arsenic via rice milk, though exposure is likely very low unless you’re drinking a lot of rice milk. People &lt;a href="https://hhs.iowa.gov/health-prevention/providers-professionals/center-acute-disease-epidemiology/epi-manual/environmental-disease/arsenic-poisoning" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;consume&lt;/a&gt; an estimated 5 to 25 micrograms of arsenic daily as part of their diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blended milk&lt;/strong&gt;: Blended milks are relatively new and need further study. One 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224423003837#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; suggests blended milks have a more similar mouthfeel to dairy milk than non-blended alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some alternative milk products combine various plant protein sources, and may be fortified with calcium, vitamin D and other nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;If you want a product with a higher protein content, opt for soy or pea, which naturally contain protein, or blended products with those ingredients, says Johnson. Pea milk, for example, may have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10504201/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;7 grams&lt;/a&gt; more protein per one-cup serving than almond milk, and also naturally contains vitamin A. Research &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224423003837#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that blending different plant proteins can create a more nutritious product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 17:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOQUhhWUVsNEtFR2tsTmJuZk12QThWMjBwdXIzZnI0Rm9DRUVNTzhJTWtSVmZsNU1GSmY2UExueTFYVkhKbC12ZnBCLVBDNXNmY0xSQ2EtOUMyb1A5WmtCaHVGNjZVaThKenhXV1NCZENpNFplVTM2MDZjcXVQWF9MSE5XX21DVEwwdndZNHpleXYyUU53YmFaQTFydTJFaFJkSHpacnFjRllJbkhKU1E</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，长期使用褪黑激素可能会影响心脏健康- NewsNation</title><link>https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/study-melatonin-linked-heart-failure/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkryke3004t27nrb5uxbz42@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People looking to lose weight and lower their blood sugar may someday be able to get a single injection that turns their cells into tiny factories churning out a protein that is essentially the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound and Mounjaro.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00033b6qtc0l6ze8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s the ambition of two biotech startups, New York-based RenBio and Fractyl Health in Massachusetts. Both companies have completed initial tests showing that their approaches work, at least in mice, and both have started tests in larger animals — pigs and monkeys — to see whether their gene therapies can work in larger animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00043b6qp5nbprgo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With continued success and enough funding, they hope to bring the therapies to human patients — although it may take years more research to prove that their ideas work and are safe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00053b6qcc4lb7o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Newer GLP-1 medications – available as injections and pills – have proven to be highly effective for weight loss, ushering in a new era of obesity treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00063b6qq5f058tc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            GLP-1, which stands for glucagon-like peptide-1, is a hormone made by the body that helps signal to the brain and the gut that it’s full and doesn’t need to eat any more. The new weight loss drugs mimic the action of this hormone by increasing the secretion of insulin to lower blood sugar. They also slow the movement of food through the digestive tract, which helps people feel full more quickly and for longer, and they work in the brain to reduce appetite.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00073b6qvw6dct54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In less than two years, the percentage of American adults using these meds for weight loss has roughly doubled, rising from 5.8% to 12%, according to &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/696599/obesity-rate-declining.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;a recent Gallup report&lt;/a&gt;. Their popularity may finally be making a dent in the nation’s obesity rate, which dropped from 39.9% in 2023 to 37% in 2025, according to Gallup.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00083b6q1krx5qoe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the medicines can be expensive, and up to half of users say they have side effects including nausea, vomiting and fatigue. Studies suggest that people need to continue using them to maintain their weight loss, but many people don’t love the idea of staying on them indefinitely. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2829779" target="_blank"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that nearly two-thirds of people without diabetes who started GLP-1 drugs stopped within a year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna00093b6qjibnhy3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The next wave of research has sought to capitalize on the benefits of GLP-1s with fewer downsides. That’s where companies like Fractyl and RenBio come in.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna000a3b6q4l0dg5nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Fractyl is presenting &lt;a href="https://planion-client-files.s3.amazonaws.com/TOS/blobs/269179c7-14eb-4d25-8546-a221f38def74/1/HANDOUT_OW_2025_Seeley_et_al_PGTx.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;the latest results&lt;/a&gt; from its trial of a gene therapy called Rejuva in mice at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society, called ObesityWeek, which is being held in Atlanta this week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrzpna000b3b6qgdll4hhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio shared its results from ongoing mouse studies as a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.30.656889v3" target="_blank"&gt;preprint paper&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it has not been peer reviewed or accepted into a medical journal, last month.  RenBio will also present updated findings at ObesityWeek.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhkrynfc00003b6qy9s3myh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio calls its technology “Make Your Own,” and it’s a relatively simple idea. They use a plasmid — a ring of naked DNA — in saline solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000j3b6q1etik32f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, carries the instructions that the body uses to build and constantly refurbish itself. It lives in the nucleus, or brain, of every cell as a twisting, double-sided ladder. The ladder is made up of four individual nucleic acids, like the letters that make up words in a book, strung together in long chains that spell out the instructions for proteins.  The order of the letters tells the body how to make the proteins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000k3b6qjh7172g5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In RenBio’s case, the researchers spelled out the instructions to make a GLP-1 receptor agonist protein — essentially the same active ingredient in medicines like Ozempic and Mounjaro — and looped it into a small circle called a plasmid. They injected saline solution containing these plasmids into muscle tissue and used short electrical pulses — milliseconds long — to zap the muscle cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000l3b6qyultd0ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It works really efficiently. Basically, the electrical pulses transiently make little pores in the cell membrane that allow the DNA rings to slip into the cell,” said Dr. Rachel Liberatore, president and chief scientific officer at RenBio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000m3b6qpvn1tyd6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            From there, the plasmids migrate to the nucleus, where they hang out in the jelly-like cytoplasm. When the cell gets ready to translate its own DNA, the plasmid DNA is read and translated right alongside it. When the cell reads the instructions, it builds the GLP-1 receptor agonist protein and releases it into the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000n3b6qcftrvrhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Liberatore said that although RenBio’s therapy uses a genetic technology, it’s not a traditional gene therapy: The researchers aren’t trying to fix a broken gene. Rather, they’re using the cell’s own machinery to turn it into a protein factory.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000o3b6qwpsmy6om@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The DNA we’re injecting, the plasmid DNA, doesn’t interfere with your own DNA in any way. So it doesn’t interfere with your own chromosomes. It doesn’t integrate. It’s not something you’re going to pass on to your children,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000p3b6qx0ksenod@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio is also using this platform to make protein therapies that can be built in the same way, like antibodies to the Zika virus. The work is supported by the federal government’s Defense Advanced Research Project Agency, or DARPA, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, known as BARDA.  It’s also supported by the Wellcome Trust, a health research foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000q3b6qqrqo599p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In RenBio’s most successful experiments, mice injected with the plasmids lost about 15% of their body weight, which was significantly more than mice in a placebo group. The loss was maintained for at least a year after they received the plasmid DNA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000r3b6qzlxvp0a4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In each formulation tested, the weight loss leveled off in mice treated with the plasmids. In essence, they hit a plateau. But that’s a good thing if you’re using a long-acting therapy, Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000s3b6qo4retzt5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were actually quite happy to see that, because you don’t necessarily want continued weight loss for a year, a year and a half,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000t3b6q1fwpxz25@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Glucose tolerance tests show that blood sugar was better regulated, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000u3b6q72u7pkur@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers aren’t sure how long the plasmids may remain active. The idea is that a doctor might give their patients a shot every year or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000v3b6qqk8ns438@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think what our take on it is, it’s really ideally suited for the sort of maintenance phase that people are starting to talk about with GLP-1s,” Liberatore said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000w3b6qcqk5tlr5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The plasmid platform has also been tested on monkeys, and the researchers even used the device to inject themselves – albeit with pure saline, not with any plasmids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0ta8000x3b6qtuatzmjm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            RenBio hopes to begin testing its plasma platform to deliver instructions for making antibodies against the Zika virus in people next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmhks0xpl000z3b6qhjyxc85q@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="targeting-cells-to-help-the-body-make-more-glp-1" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Targeting cells to help the body make more GLP-1
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks0dvy000h3b6qqbsqpd6f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another company called Fractyl Health is taking a slightly different approach. It uses a more traditional gene therapy technique in which the outer shell of a small virus — called an adeno-associated virus — slips DNA into cells and givens them the instructions to make GLP-1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00143b6q6pwhjabm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In rare cases, when viruses are used to deliver genes, they can trigger an immune response in the body, leading to potentially dangerous inflammation, allergic reactions or organ damage. In other cases, gene therapy vectors like viruses may wind up where they’re not supposed to be and can introduce errors into the genomes of cells, which &lt;a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cdnews/news/1778/Gene-Therapy-Causes-Cancer-in-Some-Children" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001i3b6q35y2j5wp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The idea is that a single treatment delivered directly to the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas would never need to be repeated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00153b6qwfnfqph3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because we are delivering it locally, we believe that we will need a very low dose of this virus, which helps gives us confidence in the potential safety in people,” said Dr. Harith Rajagopalan, co-founder and CEO of Fractyl Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00163b6qt7hr65jz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers have tried this in mice and pigs, and both tests were successful, Rajagopalan said. But mice and pigs aren’t humans, and many therapies that have succeeded in lab animals have gone on to fail in people.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00173b6qqnjfiejg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is promise, but much more data would be needed to consider human clinical trials, as it likely would be irreversible,” said Dr. Donald Kohn, a distinguished professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics, at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at the University of California – Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u00183b6qjkecfx0f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The concern would be, the genetic change would be permanent so if there is over-expression … which may change with various states — weight loss, illness, aging, hormonal changes — it could cause problems from over-expression with no way to reverse, except remove the pancreas or treated muscle,” Kohn said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Kohn said there has long been a debate in gene therapy about whether it should be used for non-disease treatment, such as enhancement of height or muscle mass. In general, the feeling is that it should not be used for enhancements.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001a3b6qi1wz5iny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This certainly is near that line between Medicine and enhancement and so I think that’s another reason that needs to be considered whether this is something that should be gone into,” Kohn said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Fractyl says it has filed the regulatory paperwork in the US to start human trials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We anticipate seeing human data in the next year, in 2026,” Rajagopalan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001d3b6qxuvm1mvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Viruses are experts at infecting cells, so scientists use that capability to slip DNA into a cell, so the cell can start building the proteins the researchers want it to build – in this case, GLP-1.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001e3b6q50cp7zbl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gene therapy like this can be risky, however, so in order to minimize the risk, the researchers designed their DNA to recognize the promoter sequence for insulin. Promoter sequences are short stretches of DNA that tell the cell’s copying machinery where a new protein starts. It acts like an on/off switch in the DNA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001f3b6q0rbd0kco@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By having the DNA sequence for GLP-1 recognize the insulin promoter, the researchers tied the function of their sequence to the production of insulin, another hormone that helps regulate blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001g3b6qq8m9x63t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means only cells that make insulin will also make GLP-1, limiting the dose that’s delivered to the body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001h3b6qj08c9qho@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It also creates a way to dial up or down the volume of extra GLP-1. When a mouse eats a high-fat, high-calorie meal, its body will make more insulin but also more GLP-1, to guard against weight gain. When it eats a more moderate serving of its normal chow, it won’t make as much GLP-1, so it won’t lose weight when it doesn’t need to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In mice, the results have been encouraging, said Dr. Randy Seeley, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies hormone signaling as it relates to type 2 diabetes and obesity. Fractyl hired Seeley to test the gene therapy, and he owns stock options in the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001k3b6qurx2gwh4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Obese mice that were treated with the gene therapy, which Fractyl calls Rejuva, lost about 20% of their body weight within three weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001l3b6qlruvbgcm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It outperformed semaglutide,” the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, Rajagopalan said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001m3b6qz07rvbdf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When researchers treated normal-weight mice with the gene therapy and then fed them a high-fat diet, the mice did not gain weight. Their blood sugar also stayed normal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001n3b6q8ovs41mk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When they gave the gene therapy to lean mice who ate their normal diet, the lean mice didn’t lose excessive amounts of weight. They also didn’t seem to develop dangerously low blood sugar, suggesting that it might be safe to use to prevent obesity as well as treat and maintain it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001o3b6q75oeppqn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It might also be a way to prevent diabetes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Rajagopalan envisions a day when it might be possible to identify people at risk of obesity, because of a family history or other factors, and give them gene therapy to prevent that fate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001q3b6qj4gl9gqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a food environment where processed foods have been engineered to trick the brain into eating unhealthy amounts, he sees this gene therapy as potentially helping people regain control over their appetite and health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001r3b6q2hlf1i9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Food is cheaper per calorie and more widely available than at any point in human history,” Rajagopalan said. “We’re just not built to make enough GLP-1 for the world around us.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmhks214u001s3b6qdcqrfqpd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The solution, he said, may be helping the body make more of its own.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “There’s a long way to go before you get there, and we can’t minimize the work involved. I mean, that’s equivalent to saying we’re going to colonize Mars, in terms of the magnitude of effort involved to get there,” Rajagopalan said. “But why not aspire to aspire to that?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3e93a3c9-94b8-4fc1-952b-2c6e11f9bb57"&gt;Can we change bad memories? In this adapted excerpt from "How to Change a Memory" (Princeton University Press, 2025), author and neuroscientist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Steve Ramirez&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recounts the events that led him and his colleagues to discover memories could be artificially controlled in rodents, by tapping directly into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="078937a2-fe8a-4c02-8291-f0e714027515"&gt;&lt;p id="ad4660bd-5c49-4f3b-b60d-82dee64909d4" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Feelings like anxiety are hard to understand because they're often invisible to everyone else. But they're part of everyday life. We all regularly experience bouts of stress and anxiety. What if the job interviewer doesn't like me? Should I cram tonight for my exam tomorrow? What should I say on my first date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="ad4660bd-5c49-4f3b-b60d-82dee64909d4-1"&gt;Our biology often forces us to be prepared for multiple outcomes in the midst of uncertainty. It's healthy to care about these multiple outcomes because it encourages us to put in the work, to adequately prep for a given stressful event. And yet, sometimes the scales of stress become tilted to such an extreme that pathologies of the brain begin to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tremendous variation in how any individual arrives at a state of anxiety, for example, highlights that our brain contains many winding roads that can ultimately converge on the same feeling. We all have our triggers in life, but what those triggers are depends on experience — on memory. When these differences impair our mood, thinking, behavior and overall daily functioning, then they get lumped into a category. What's more, if observed impairments share similar features, then this category itself falls within a broader classification — that of a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="35543d0f-56ff-4e96-9f29-3ca1a42fa8af"&gt;As I was entering my last year of graduate school, I was just beginning to understand how omnipresent an anxious feeling can truly be. Just as my own stressors in life began accumulating — finishing my thesis, writing grants and job applications, continuing the seemingly never-ending search for purpose as a scientist and person — my mom too had a sudden resurgence of anxious moments that ultimately culminated in frequent panic attacks. Once I learned about her lifelong experience with the erratic thing that anxiety was for her, I started to appreciate the on-again, off-again and on-again nature of these feelings. I couldn’t stop thinking about her panic attacks and how frustrating it was to not be able to press "&lt;em&gt;off" &lt;/em&gt;on some of the most debilitating moments one can endure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1bdcf3da-c9c8-4153-839d-6d30921a8ac6"&gt;My last project in graduate school would attempt to artificially activate positive memories to suppress the symptoms associated with anxiety and depression. It would be my most personal scientific endeavor, a very direct way for me to join the fight at my mom's side and to thank her for being my superhero. If my research could somehow inspire new therapeutic strategies that might be useful for alleviating these kinds of debilitating conditions, then my work will have gained an even deeper, more personally meaningful purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My lab partner Xu Liu and I wanted to take a brain-centric approach to our newest project. Could memory itself be artificially controlled in rodents, by tapping directly into the brain to restore neuronal and behavioral balance in a therapeutic name?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-u39R7hRxDfKpmnR8cZS6wm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-u39R7hRxDfKpmnR8cZS6wm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, our project had a scientific precedent in humans — in an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3128334/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3128334/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;influential paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by psychologist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/barbara-fredrickson/" target="_blank" data-url="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/barbara-fredrickson/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Barbara Fredrickson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues called "The undoing effect of positive emotions." This study highlighted the capacity of positive emotions to undo the physiological effects that negative emotions have on the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The undoing hypothesis proposes that positive emotions can be used for more than just feeling good. They can be used to help us get out of bed in the morning; pursue happiness; change how we think about and interact with ourselves and others; and counteract, or at least regulate, negative emotions. When human subjects were stressed and then watched movie clips that elicited contentment and amusement, their bodies rebounded in beneficial ways: their stress-induced increases in cardiovascular activity, for instance, returned to baseline faster than when they watched neutral or sad movie clips. Excitingly, this reveals a very real physical connection between feelings of positivity and their direct effects on our biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xu and I wanted to further this work by testing for a potential therapeutic capacity of positive memories by jump-starting their biology from within&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the brain. We placed our animals in a box that had two small valves on separate ends: one that delivered sugar water when the animals licked it and another that delivered regular water. This is known as the sucrose preference test. Rodents normally prefer sugar water over regular water, the same way humans will typically find sugary liquids preferable to a bland liquid. On the other hand, rodents with depression-and anxiety-related behaviors tend to show a 50:50 preference. They show no preference at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, the animals displaying anxiety-and depression-related behavior licked at each of the valves randomly over the course of 15 minutes. As with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://behavioralscientist.org/manipulating-memory-through-optogenetics-qa-with-neuroscientists-xu-liu-and-steve-ramirez/" target="_blank" data-url="https://behavioralscientist.org/manipulating-memory-through-optogenetics-qa-with-neuroscientists-xu-liu-and-steve-ramirez/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — our first successful attempt at MIT to artificially control memories in the rodent brain — all we had to do was hit a button that would turn our lasers on and optogenetically awaken a memory from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deep-blue laser flickered throughout the mouse’s hippocampus, waking up — activating&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— cells that held onto a positive memory. I remember thinking that our optogenetic stimulation was a fancy, high-tech Proustian madeleine, one capable of triggering the rich remembrance of things past. If you'll entertain my romanticization of the moment: the mouse perked up immediately, as if a shudder ran from its brain to its body, and it began scanning the environment to decide which valve to visit first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An extraordinary thing was happening. I imagine that the mouse felt the memory invade all its senses, strangely detached and with no suggestion of an origin, since the essence of these sensations was &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;the mouse as much as it &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;the mouse. And once the positive memory fully revealed itself within seconds, the now-motivated mouse inspected each valve with some sniffing, followed by a taste test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f31f1ee4-25fd-437a-a4be-34016c009bf8"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to reversing abnormal behavior was embedded within their positive memories all along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="316ea602-7387-4367-984c-5634c5157a9e"&gt;When it found the valve with the sugar water, the mouse started licking vigorously, so much so that it consumed as much sugar water as our control animals. In under an hour, Xu and I saw that reactivating positive memories restored our mice's behavior to a healthy baseline. Just as exciting, reactivating positive memories also turned on many areas of the brain involved in rewarding experiences and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to reversing abnormal behavior was embedded within their positive memories all along. For as long as the laser was shining its sapphire radiance in their brains, the mice were motivated to keep consuming their sugar water reward. All this from stimulating cells in the hippocampus. Or to say this with less novelistic flare: the mice got a sugary treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following weeks, one of my gifted undergraduates &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/briana-chen" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.theramirezgroup.org/briana-chen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Briana Chen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; collected a large empirical dataset for the project, and it came with an exciting plot twist: when she artificially reactivated positive memories twice a day, or "chronically," for about a week, not only did this permanently ameliorate symptoms we believed were associated with depression and anxiety, but it also promoted&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the growth of new cells in the brain. Positive memories had both short- and long-term benefits, all the way from cells to behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc/about-rdoc" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;neuro-centric Research Domain Criteria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (RDoC) approach to treating the brain, our hope was that the biological potency of positive memories — like medications — could inform cognitive-behavioral approaches to treating disorders of the brain. This project was meaningful to me on a personal level: I thought of my mom's panic attacks and the idea that she might never have to experience the kind of crippling anxiety that robs someone of peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Positive memories are some of the most powerful biological tools available in our brains. At home, my mom and I shared a treasure trove of them — one that we both remember is from the time when I was a teenager, and we were visiting her parents in El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One morning, my cousins, parents and grandparents all walked down a hill behind the house my mom grew up in to go swimming in the village pond. My cousins kept egging me on to jump from a cliff into the pond, and my mom kept telling me I didn't have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like her, I was the opposite of an adrenaline-seeker because, oh I don't know, maybe my innate biology was onto something, as "please do not free-fall to Earth" kept repeating in my mind. She could see that I was scared, and after a few minutes she suggested, much to my surprise, that we jump together. We held hands and tiptoed to the edge — &lt;em&gt;uno&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tres &lt;/em&gt;— we were in the air! Moments later, we emerged from the water laughing in delightful disbelief at our newfound courage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="b080303f-477d-4385-9c00-161cb1364dd7"&gt;Neuroscience tells us that this memory has all the ingredients of life's dessert that make us feel good. From an RDoC perspective, my cognitive and valence systems are all interacting to produce the riches from this experience: the cognitive system enables the memory of jumping off of a cliff, which at first generated feelings of fear via the negative valence systems, which are now almost immediately counteracted by feelings of reward via the positive valence systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was once a moment of fear is now a memory of triumph with my mom. It's the only time I can remember when we both took a literal leap of faith, so we cherish the memory as an example of what our brains can achieve together. A million little life moments like these, packaged neatly into a million memories that we hold onto constitute the good stuff in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr id="442bfef3-8420-4720-8bcd-ef948a521e15"&gt;&lt;p id="dda2c8cc-94c4-4bc2-b874-e2c0b49c5ff8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adapted from &lt;/em&gt;"How To Change a Memory: One Neuroscientist's Quest To Alter The Past"&lt;em&gt;.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj1kz000e3b77qvvbbcim@published"&gt;I had what I thought was an excellent interview. Seemed to hit it off with the manager. She even gave me her direct phone number and said she would have an answer the following week. She seemed to like all my answers to her questions. We also bonded over the fact her mom has dementia and I told her my grandmother had Alzheimer’s. I wound up receiving another job offer. So over a week went by I called and left her a message. I never heard back. I then called my HR contact and told her I received a job offer but their job opening was my first choice. The HR person assured me she would get me an answer and that she would let me know either way by the end of that day. I never heard from either of them! It’s been over two weeks, and I took the other job. But I’m feeling like I was ghosted. I’m trying not to feel offended, but I just feel it was unprofessional to treat me that way. What’s your opinion?&lt;br&gt;—Ghosted&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="2" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hy000l3b77ixdnebfw@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Ghosted,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hz000m3b77gpwsbvuk@published"&gt;Job searching in 2025 feels like it was designed by a sadist. You send applications off into the void, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; get an acknowledgement that it was even received, and then if you’re lucky and your resume somehow makes it past the AI screening because it stood out among the hundreds of others that the company received, you get called for an interview. But even that human interaction doesn’t necessarily mean that you’ll be treated like an actual human afterwards—it seems that getting ghosted is sadly the rule these days, not the exception. It’s as if recruiters are taking a cue from the worst serial daters, the ones who go on a great date and then just never follow up.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hz000n3b77dvz9gxdy@published"&gt;Ghosting culture is rude, it’s painful, and it’s also bewildering, especially when you have what seemed like a good interview where you really hit it off with the person interviewing you! It can make you feel crazy, like you’ve been totally gaslit and you can’t trust your instincts about anything. How hard is it to just send an email that says, “You didn’t get the job”? (I’m sure they could figure out a nicer way to say it, but that’s the gist.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqj2hz000o3b77kvm1r5n8@published"&gt;All this to say: I agree it was unprofessional of them to treat you this way, you have every right to feel offended, and now it’s time to move on. Try to be grateful that you had another job offer come through at the same time and put the ghosters out of your mind, and focus on your new role. And congrats on it, by the way. Who knows—maybe you dodged a bullet at the other company. They don’t deserve you, anyway!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqmi5y001k3b77fyc2qrzn@published"&gt;My best friend and I have decided we will be moving out of state in about a year and a half (the political climate in our current state is increasingly unsafe for her, but our immediate situation is safe enough that we feel comfortable staying out our lease). How do I handle this, job-wise? Obviously I don’t need or want to give my boss a 16-month notice, but two weeks seems kind of cruel when I know this far in advance. And how soon do I start job searching in the new state? As soon as possible seems ideal theoretically, but no one is going to hire a candidate who can’t start for another year, right?&lt;/p&gt;

But it’s way too early to start looking for a job in another state. There’s often a little bit of a chicken-and-egg game that happens when you are hoping to move to a different state and get a job—a lot of companies won’t look at out of state applicants, but moving without a job is very stressful and might make it more difficult to rent an apartment or get established in your new home. I would start looking a couple of months before you’re planning on moving, and either use a friend’s address in your new state on your resume or be very clear that you are moving no matter what. Or maybe the perfect remote role will open up and you won’t have to worry about finding a new job at all! I’ll put that out into the universe for you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkqmden001d3b775313eqk8@published"&gt;In terms of when to tell your current boss, you’re right that 16 months is way too far in advance. Things could change in 16 months! Your timeline could shift, for one thing, and you don’t want to quit so far in advance that you find yourself with an unsustainable gap between jobs. Also, I hate to even mention this, but it’s possible you could lose your job in the next 16 months. Personally I would give no more than one month, and that’s only if you really feel obligated to give that much. I can hear in your letter that you don’t want to let down your boss, and while that’s admirable, trust me when I say that no company is as loyal to you as you may feel to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhkoy9n3003ymfktsnsjyqap@published"&gt;I just started a new job, and I’m still trying to make a good impression. But my new boss just enthusiastically shared something that made my heart sink. The one thing I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; enjoy in my last job was after-hours team events. They weren’t frequent, twice a year, but I hated them. Sometimes, there was a benefit for attending (like free dinner) other times there was actually a cost (like potluck?!) but honestly, either way, I &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wanted to go. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/advice/2025/07/work-advice-after-hours-team-events-avoid.html"&gt;Well, this job is going to have even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; after-hours team events! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the globe, heart disease remains one of the top causes of death. Once patients begin to suffer from serious heart problems, like heart attacks and heart failure, the heart muscles become damaged and are difficult to treat and repair. Although many therapies have been developed to treat symptoms, full recovery to a pre-disease state has been essentially impossible. This is due to a lack of regeneration ability in adult human heart cells. Studies using stem cells or progenitor cells for repair have demonstrated limited efficacy in clinical trials, thus far.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                        
                                          
                                         
										

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;However, there may be new hope for these patients. Researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York have been working to turn back time by switching on a gene known to regenerate heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes. Their study, recently &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-025-00438-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;npj Regenerative Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, indicates that adult human hearts may be given the ability to regenerate themselves with future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CCNA2—the 'master regulator' of the heart cell cycle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study focuses on a gene called Cyclin A2 (CCNA2), which is functional during fetal growth and shuts off shortly after birth, limiting the ability for cell regeneration. In fetuses, while CCNA2 is still functional, it plays an important role in cell division and growth, facilitating the creation of new heart cells. However, adults appear to still have a very limited capacity for repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There has been evidence of low-level cardiomyocyte turnover in the healthy human heart, but it is very limited, and this ability declines with age. Thus, cardiac regeneration in response to injury such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/myocardial+infarction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;myocardial infarction&lt;/a&gt; (MI) remains a clinical challenge," the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study authors refer to CCNA2 as the "master regulator" of the heart cell cycle. So far, studies surrounding CCNA2—mostly in animal models—have shown promise in its ability to be switched back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, one of the lead authors, Hina Chaudry, was involved in another &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24553388/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which CCNA2 was activated in a pig that had recently suffered from a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+attack/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. CCNA2 successfully induced heart cell division in the pig and its heart function improved. Studies involving mice showed similar results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the team moved on to testing out this method on in vitro human cells from adults aged 41 and 55 years old. To do this, they engineered a harmless virus, capable of expressing human CCNA2 and delivered it to the cultured cells. They then performed live-cell imaging to track cell division and structure. Finally, they performed RNA sequencing in mouse and human heart samples to analyze any changes in gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were promising—CCNA2 induced heart cell regeneration in the 41 and 55-year-old heart cells, reactivating the fetal-like and regenerative gene programs in the cells. They found that the resulting daughter cells retained heart muscle structure and function, and continued to handle calcium effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, RNA sequencing in mice revealed a subpopulation of heart cells with active &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cell+division/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cell division&lt;/a&gt; and reprogramming gene signatures, even after CCNA2 expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Taken together, these findings suggest that the partial reprogramming induced by CCNA2 reflects a controlled activation of developmental programs, consistent with regenerative responses observed in neonatal hearts, and aligns with prior evidence that modest increases in cell cycle &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/gene+expression/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; can enhance cardiac regeneration capacity," the study authors write.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;A new hope for future heart disease patients&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While further research is needed to optimize the delivery of CCNA2 and conduct human trials, this research presents an exciting opportunity for future therapies with the ability to repair hearts instead of only treating symptoms. Potential applications include regenerative gene therapy to repair damage after heart attacks, or even alternatives to heart transplantation and current cell therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlike cell transplantation or non-specific mitogens, CCNA2 integrates proliferative drive with lineage fidelity, thereby offering a safer and more effective strategy for cardiac regeneration. Future work defining the molecular signatures of proliferative CCNA2-positive cardiomyocytes will enable the development of precision-guided therapies, whether through direct gene transfer or by reactivating endogenous CCNA2 using antisense approaches," the study authors write.&lt;/p&gt;
