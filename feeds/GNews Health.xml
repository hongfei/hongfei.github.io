The hospital was also linked to an 2021 outbreak that hospitalized more than a dozen people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dchia"&gt;Don Weiss, a former city health official who helped coordinate past responses to infectious disease outbreaks, was critical of the fact that Harlem Hospital was once again at the center of an outbreak’s origins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="c1nv6"&gt;“They should’ve been keeping a really close eye on that,” Weiss said. “You should be way above the testing requirements to make sure you’re never again showing up on the news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="53ro9"&gt;The second building was a construction site for a public health lab at 40 West 137th St. overseen by the NYC Economic Development Corporation and the construction contractor Skanska USA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="fr9l"&gt;According to publicly available health department data, the hospital had been in compliance with rules requiring it to submit Legionella testing samples every three months. Its most recent sample before the outbreak was submitted in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="69o9e"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/legionnaires-inspections-sank-to-near-record-low-ahead-of-nyc-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous Gothamist analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the rate of city inspections for cooling towers has been declining since the regulations were first implemented. After an increase in inspections immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic, numbers of inspections dropped again starting in 2022, after Mayor Eric Adams took office. The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene attributed the drop to staffing shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8f7kb"&gt;Morse, the health commissioner, said the buildings were identified through matching genetic samples from both the cooling towers and the people who were sickened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="832h"&gt;During the briefing, Deputy Commissioner Corinne Schiff, who oversees the Division of Environmental Health, said she didn’t know whether the construction site had conducted regular Legionella testing but that the department would investigate the site’s testing history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cs5i6"&gt;According to public data, however, there are no records of Legionella testing or city inspections for the construction site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ag1po"&gt;Chris Boyd, a former assistant commissioner at the health department who helped write new regulations for cooling towers in the wake of a 2015 outbreak that killed 16 people, said this outbreak was completely preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="1npf2"&gt;“The health department is masking the fact that this is not a naturally occurring phenomena,” he said. “It only occurs in systems that are not managed properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="e32d8"&gt;Following Friday’s briefing, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a current mayoral candidate, called on the state Department of Health to conduct an independent investigation of the city’s handling of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="8aeqi"&gt;“With the source of this outbreak now tied to a city-run facility, it is all the more important that an independent review be undertaken to ensure accountability, transparency, and public trust,” Cuomo wrote in a &lt;a href="https://us17.campaign-archive.com/?u=6261123845ede52d0d0ec256e&amp;amp;id=99dd2ed872" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="84mhm"&gt;In response to the outbreak, Morse said the department will raise fines for building owners who fail to regularly test for Legionella bacteria. The department will also require building owners to test every 30 days instead of the currently required 90 days, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6hv3r"&gt;Additionally, Morse said the department will also try to hire more water ecologists to address the current staff shortage, but she did not provide details on whether the budget for those staff vacancies would be increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6etrp"&gt;A Gothamist &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-lost-health-inspectors-in-years-preceding-harlem-legionnaires-disease-outbreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that the health department lost more than a third of its cooling tower inspectors in the past three years, despite a boost in funding for the unit in the department that conducts the inspections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPWnRpaDdhR3hOR0FONjZuS3plVEt1MTdRUG8yNGY3U09EeU1RQmx2SjRaaFBxby1nQXZoVzhIMDFMMi1SLXJUcG1OMk5MZmxMQ0gtNDU2UEt0T2p0dTR0dlR6NW9jNUdiT3Qwem0zMW9GdzBOMXlCNFlmRkFscVhEZEJMU2JiMlBSTk5RSkVjX0p1VlhFR1BFaDRVaEZwdw</guid></item><item><title>无食欲、肝脏问题、关节疼痛：对乙酰氨基酚是罪魁祸首吗？ -《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/30/liver-damage-acetaminophen-rare-disease-medical-mystery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text subtype-from-the-source" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H3PNCPZRF5EFVJZGTXGVUAUUS4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While lugging a mattress up the stairs, Matt Smith lost his grip, fell on a post and broke two ribs.

Soft toys in particular can mimic the feeling of companionship and even trigger nurturing instincts, especially in breeds like Golden Retrievers, who are known for their &lt;span&gt;caring&lt;/span&gt;, family-oriented nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watch him trade his watermelon toy for a taste of the real thing in this video from August 20:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Whether Archie lets his toys wash without needing to keep a close eye on them in the future, remains to be seen.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, your food choices matter. The right foods not only keep you regular, but also feed your gut microbes, support digestion and make nutrients easier to absorb. One often-overlooked food is cereal—a surprisingly good choice for gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But with endless cereal boxes lining the grocery store aisles, which is the best cereal for gut health? We asked a gastroenterologist to share his top pick.

He recommends this cereal for its high fiber content and mix of sprouted grains and legumes, which provide a diverse range of plant-based fibers. That diversity matters—research shows that eating a variety of plants is linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthier, more resilient gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Seven Plants in Every Bowl &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the simplest ways to support gut health is to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-eat-every-week-for-a-healthy-gut-8696826" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more plants&lt;/a&gt;. “I’m a huge advocate for focusing on adding more varieties of plants to our diet,” says Bulsiewicz. That’s because each plant contributes its own fibers and phytonutrients, which help to fuel a healthier gut microbiome, he explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research from the American Gut Project found that people with the healthiest guts were eating at least 30 different plants per week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With seven plants in one bowl—wheat, barley, millet, lentils, soybeans, spelt and rosemary—this cereal makes it easy to achieve that goal.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Made with Sprouted Grains &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sprouted grains are especially important for gut health because sprouting changes their nutrition. Sprouting starts the germination process in seeds and legumes, activating enzymes that naturally enhance their nutritional profile. “It increases the bioavailability of iron, zinc and other minerals, lowers phytic acid and other antinutrients, and generally results in food that’s easier to digest,” says Bulsiewicz.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; These changes make sprouted grains a smart choice for both nutrition and gut health. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber plays many roles in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrients-to-support-gut-health-11791719" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting a healthy gut&lt;/a&gt;: it strengthens the gut lining, supports digestion and absorption of nutrients, feeds beneficial gut bacteria and helps to lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The problem is, an estimated 90% of adults do not eat enough fiber, which is why it’s important to start making it a priority.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By adding this to your diet, you can get an impressive 6 grams of fiber—21% of your daily fiber needs—in a half-cup serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Organic certification means the grains and legumes in this cereal are grown without most synthetic pesticides, fertilizers or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). “This also means that they weren’t sprayed with glyphosate after harvest, a common weed killer that’s often used to dry out wheat, legumes and other whole grains,” says Bulsiewicz. He points out that some research suggests glyphosate can negatively affect the gut microbiome, which is why he prefers to avoid it whenever possible.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair with Fruit.&lt;/strong&gt; Add berries, kiwi or apple for extra fiber and phytochemicals—compounds that feed your gut microbes and support overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top with Seeds or Nuts.&lt;/strong&gt; Sprinkle on some chia seeds, flaxseed, walnuts or almonds to get in more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-gut-and-heart-health-8771784" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy fats, plants and fiber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mix It into Yogurt. &lt;/strong&gt;Add a handful of cereal to Greek yogurt for a satisfying, fiber- and protein-rich breakfast or snack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enjoy It with Kefir. &lt;/strong&gt;Pour kefir over your cereal for an added gut boost. Kefir is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-probiotic-drinks-8727164" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;fermented dairy drink rich in probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, which work alongside the cereal’s fiber to support a diverse and balanced gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use It as a Crunchy Topping. &lt;/strong&gt;Try sprinkling the cereal over smoothie bowls, oatmeal or even a fruit salad for added crunch and an easy way to sneak in more plants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for Fiber.&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for cereals with at least 3 grams of fiber per serving. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Whole Grains.&lt;/strong&gt; Whole-food ingredients like oats, wheat or millet provide prebiotic fibers and phytonutrients that help diversify the gut microbiome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep Added Sugars Low.&lt;/strong&gt; Many cereals contain too much added sugar, which can offset the gut benefits of fiber. If you prefer a sweeter taste, consider adding some fresh fruit to your bowl instead, or choose cereals with 3 grams of sugar or less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The golden rule of gut health is to eat for more plant diversity,” says Bulsiewicz. Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal makes this easier by delivering a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-fiber-than-beans-11785771" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich source of fiber&lt;/a&gt;, sprouted grains and seven plant ingredients in one bowl. It’s also the perfect base for gut-healthy additions like fruit, nuts and dairy, which bring even more nutrition into the mix. Together, these foods create the kind of variety your gut microbiome thrives on. When shopping for cereals, choose options that are high in fiber, made with whole grains and low in added sugars.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnv000123b7agb1kzzt8@published"&gt;My mother-in-law, “Patricia,” is a recovering alcoholic with six years of sobriety. Recently, my sister needed me to take her and my 1-year-old nephew to an appointment with his pediatrician (her car was in the shop and her husband was at work). I left my 3-year-old son, “Harry,” with Patricia.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnwy00133b7avyak35cw@published"&gt;While I was with my sister, I received a call from a neighbor. She had been walking her dog when she came across Harry wandering the neighborhood in tears. He told her that “Grandma won’t wake up.” She took him home and found Patricia passed out. A nearly empty Scotch bottle (which had been a gift from a client to my husband; we don’t drink and were planning to re-gift it) was on the floor. My neighbor called 911, and then she called me. Patricia had to remain hospitalized for two days with alcohol poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbnz300143b7asilu96do@published"&gt;Now my husband is blaming me for not hiding the Scotch “properly,” given that I know his mother’s history. The bottle was in our pantry behind the cereal boxes! The top of the bottle was visible, but it wasn’t exactly conspicuous, and honestly, it never occurred to me to “hide” it. And while it’s tragic that his mother had a relapse and became seriously ill as a result of it, it could have been even more of a tragedy for our son, outdoors alone looking for help, and that isn’t registering with him. Patricia has been extremely apologetic, but considering what happened, I don’t want her watching Harry on her own anymore. My husband says I am trying to “punish” his mother for what happened. As far as he’s concerned, it will never again be an issue since we don’t usually keep alcohol in the house. Am I going too far?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="3" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbo3a00163b7a61z0i9ez@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Terrible Time,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="89" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbo5200173b7awyd93uhj@published"&gt;There’s too much I don’t know for me to make a ruling about whether forever banning Patricia as a sitter is “going too far.” Since she was the one you turned to in a non-emergency situation to sit for your 3-year-old, I’m guessing that she has three years of reliability and trustworthiness behind her. You’re in a much better position than I to determine whether what happened is an anomaly. (Your husband’s argument—that it won’t/can’t happen again because you won’t have alcohol in the house in the future—is specious.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="75" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcbo7400183b7afrfbyhzw@published"&gt;The bigger issue here, I think, is that your husband blames you for what happened. This is not a healthy or reasonable reaction. (I suspect that it’s a learned one; that rationalizing his mom’s drinking and blaming it on others was once a coping mechanism.) It’s also a problem that he is now angry with you for “punishing” his mom—as is, obviously, his failure to take seriously the jeopardy his mother put your son in.&lt;/p&gt;

If you can’t talk honestly about what happened without fighting (or talking past each other), get some help. As to having your mother-in-law babysit, I’d give it some time. In other words, for now and the immediate future, do not leave your child with her (you don’t need to make a big announcement about it; just don’t do it). See how things go. You can revisit this decision later.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmexcjdu2002c3b7a7bqmv1ml@published"&gt;Is there such a thing as taking too many pictures of your kids? My husband, who is a great father, is really fanatical about taking photos of our only child, a 3-year-old girl. He takes pictures of her CONSTANTLY. He thinks it’s important to document every day, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2020/12/childhood-photos-too-many-care-and-feeding.html"&gt;so he’ll take a minimum of 10 photos daily, along with a few short videos.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The results were presented at &lt;a href="/topic/madrid"&gt;Madrid’s&lt;/a&gt; European Society of Cardiology congress, the world’s largest heart conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bundgaard said: “With a broader view we can say that higher dietary intake of potassium may not only benefit patients with heart disease but probably all of us, so maybe we should all reduce sodium and increase potassium content in our food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/blood-pressure-banana-lower-salt-b2736276.html"&gt;a study published in the American Journal of Physiology-Renal Physiology&lt;/a&gt; found that eating more potassium can also lower blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anita Layton, one of the study’s authors, said: “Our research suggests that adding more potassium-rich foods to your diet such as bananas or broccoli might have a greater positive impact on your blood pressure than just cutting sodium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 09:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNV1dMVXJlMy1jRG1hTklLb09jNl9kZ2FRR25jZ0daTG53U3FhbW91TVdiOFUxb1BWaUE1UU1VcVBoZDdOYl9IS0hLU0hJT3gtTUdQRXFtYXN4Tm9UaEplYjZqcEhvUzhhQ3pZNG1PUVNqa2xJeEExTDZnOWxZclBRRnlMaTRnTUxjYi00cHNBdngzUUFjSEZKd2F0REc3RUZJOG4tMg</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，医生可能需要重新考虑一些患者在心脏病发作后数十年的常规β受体阻滞剂使用情况- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/doctors-rethink-decades-routine-beta-blocker-patients-after/story?id=125112970</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A large new study conducted in Spain and Italy found that beta blockers, drugs often used to slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure, did not provide clear benefits for heart attack patients whose hearts were still functioning well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The results of the study, known as REBOOT, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Saturday and presented during the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2025 in Madrid, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The REBOOT trial enrolled more than 8,400 patients recovering from a heart attack whose heart function was above 40% and assigned them to either take a beta blocker or no beta blocker within two weeks of leaving the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Medical equipment is seen in this stock photo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="qinlA IpWvx oqZz tylGM lyWxS nWcVF UhTug PPcLh YxlyB "&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ YNujN JGtjI aZFDu rkKLh "&gt;Westend61/Getty Images/Westend61&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Over the course of approximately 3.7 years, there was no significant difference when it came to rates of death from any cause, repeat heart attacks or hospitalization for heart failure between the two groups, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In a “subanalysis” of the study, published in the European Heart Journal, researchers specifically looked at outcomes involving the approximately 1,600 women from the original REBOOT trial and isolated their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In this case, beta blockers were associated with an increased risk of death from all causes for these women, compared to women who were not taking beta blockers.

This was a smaller-scale study that combined two clinical trials into one because separately they were not able to enroll enough patients. Different rules for who could join each of the studies in each country may have skewed the results, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“REBOOT was a cleaner study in terms of protocol and inclusion criteria,” said Dr. Steven Pfau, professor of cardiovascular medicine and interventional cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Notably, REBOOT challenges over 40 years of standardized practice, which calls for patients admitted to the hospital for a heart attack to be started on beta blockers before or shortly after they are discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cardiologists’ methods for treating heart attacks and opening blockages in the coronary arteries in a timely fashion have improved drastically over the past 10-20 years, experts say. That's why, in an age of improved medical therapies and procedural interventions for heart attacks, such as better-performing coronary artery stents, it may be time to rethink the long-standing guidance on beta-blocker use, according to some experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“Beta blockers were developed at a time before routine reperfusion therapy for acute heart attacks and the evolution of more potent medications, and care has really evolved,” said Fonarow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Pfau said that neither study makes a compelling case for beta blockers versus no beta blockers for this select group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“If beta blockers do have an effect, it is probably small, given the other therapies we have,” he said. “It fits the discussion for both studies that, with the way we currently practice, beta blockers potentially add very little to outcomes after a heart attack for patients with preserved heart function and no other pre-existing reason to be on a beta blocker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If patients can take beta blockers safely, they should keep using them for now, Fonarow advised.

From “high &lt;a href="/topic/protein"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;” cereal bars to “low-&lt;a href="/topic/fat"&gt;fat&lt;/a&gt;” yoghurts and “plant-based” ready meals, the labels are designed to scream &lt;a href="/topic/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – but the ingredients list often tells a different story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these so-called “healthy” options fall into the category of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) – products linked to a growing list of health concerns, from weight gain and poor &lt;a href="/topic/gut-health"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of chronic disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, more than half the &lt;a href="/topic/calories"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt; we consume now come from UPFs, and among teenagers, that figure rises to nearly two-thirds. Research published in&lt;em&gt; BMJ&lt;/em&gt; has linked higher consumption of UPFs with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and early death – and yet they dominate our trolleys, often disguised as better-for-you choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These foods are engineered to taste irresistible, low in &lt;a href="/topic/fibre"&gt;fibre&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/topic/vitamins"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt; and minerals and high in sugar, &lt;a href="/topic/salt"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; and saturated fat,” says Rob Hobson, a nutritionist and author of &lt;em&gt;Unprocess Your Life&lt;/em&gt;. “They’re easy to overeat, can be addictive and often push healthier, nutrient-dense foods off our plates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the warnings, though, UPFs aren’t going anywhere (yet). They line every aisle, often hidden in plain sight and masquerading as healthy options – so where on Earth are shoppers supposed to start when it comes to making better choices?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The top five red flags on labels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to memorise the entire periodic table to navigate a supermarket, but Hobson says there are certain ingredients worth watching out for if you want to understand how processed a product really is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emulsifiers, for example, are designed to blend oil and water and create smooth, creamy textures in foods like ice cream, sauces, chocolate and plant milks. “Some studies suggest emulsifiers can alter gut bacteria and thin the gut’s protective mucus layer,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artificial sweeteners are another marker of a highly engineered product. Aspartame, sucralose and acesulfame K are common in “diet” drinks, low-calorie snacks and many protein bars. “They’re considered safe by regulators, but some studies suggest they can subtly alter gut microbes or influence appetite regulation,” says Hobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modified starches, such as maltodextrin or modified maize starch, are also frequently used to bulk out foods and extend shelf life. “They are rapidly digested and contribute calories without fibre, which can spike blood glucose and add little nutritional value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flavour enhancers, like monosodium glutamate (MSG) and yeast extract, are added to make snacks, sauces and ready meals taste richer and more satisfying. While “they are safe at permitted levels, they make savoury snacks and ready meals moreish, encouraging overconsumption of products that are often high in salt and fat”, Hobson explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 hJHdNK"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/24/iStock-1429988564.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/24/iStock-1429988564.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/24/iStock-1429988564.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Shoppers are becoming more savvy – but with long, confusing ingredient lists, spotting a UPF isn’t always straightforward" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-107393"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Shoppers are becoming more savvy – but with long, confusing ingredient lists, spotting a UPF isn’t always straightforward&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there are stabilisers and gums, such as xanthan gum, guar gum and carrageenan, which are added to yoghurts, sauces, plant milks and ice creams to create smooth textures and stop ingredients separating. “They aren’t ingredients you’d normally have at home,” and therefore a marker of foods that have been heavily engineered, but “while generally recognised as safe, some gums can cause digestive discomfort”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, he highlights protein isolates, which are increasingly common in protein bars, shakes and many plant-based meat substitutes. These include pea protein isolate, whey protein concentrate and soy protein isolate. The problem is, “they strip protein away from its natural &lt;a href="/topic/food"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; source,” says Hobson, “and while useful in certain contexts (like sports nutrition), they’re a signal the food has been reformulated rather than built from whole ingredients”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, Hobson adds, that many UPFs will contain a combination of these, and “while one additive on its own isn’t necessarily harmful, when you see several of these signals together, it’s a strong indication you’re looking at a food that has been manufactured in a way that prioritises convenience, taste and shelf life over nutritional quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to spot a UPF without overthinking it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to spend your entire shop glued to the back of every packet, Hobson suggests sticking to a few simple rules. One is the “five-ingredient rule”: if you don’t recognise five or more ingredients on the label, assume it’s ultra-processed. “Whole or minimally processed foods usually have just one or two ingredients, like oats, rice or tinned tomatoes, and even traditional foods like bread or cheese rarely need more than a handful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not foolproof, though: “A homemade curry paste or granola might have 10 ingredients and still be healthy,” he adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1wzq3bw-0 sc-1wzq3bw-3 kqnNdl gGuqvP"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-i07cwn-0 jOpKWt"&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" id="7892fd45317565c6" viewbox="0 0 80 47"&gt;&lt;path fill="#ec1a2e" d="M21.18 46.99c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12A17.2 17.2 0 0 0 3.99 29.86c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12A23.6 23.6 0 0 1 1.29 24.4c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.57-.96A26 26 0 0 0 24.33 0 24.3 24.3 0 0 0 0 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59m41.47 0c9.4 0 17.18-7.73 17.18-17.13 0-9.46-7.72-17.12-17.12-17.12a17.2 17.2 0 0 0-17.25 17.12c0 3.74 1.29 7.47 3.48 10.5l-.13.12a23.6 23.6 0 0 1-6.05-16.08c0-12.75 10.36-23.3 23.1-23.3a24 24 0 0 1 11.53 2.89l.58-.96A26 26 0 0 0 65.8 0a24.33 24.33 0 0 0-24.33 24.4c0 14.09 9.72 22.59 21.18 22.59"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While one additive on its own isn’t necessarily harmful, when you see several of these signals together, it’s a strong indication you’re looking at a food that has been manufactured in a way that prioritises convenience, taste and shelf life over nutritional quality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wzq3bw-4 gIguDj"&gt;Rob Hobson, nutritionist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better shortcut might be the kitchen cupboard test. Ask yourself: would I keep these ingredients at home? “If you see ingredients like invert syrup, carboxymethylcellulose or artificial flavourings, then the answer is no,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packaging can also be a giveaway. “Whole foods don’t need marketing,” says Hobson. “Fresh fruit, vegetables, eggs or rice speak for themselves. UPFs often come in bright wrappers shouting about ‘20g protein’, ‘low sugar’ or ‘fortified with vitamins’. These claims make products sound healthier than they really are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also suggests looking at the food itself: “If it no longer resembles the food it started from, then the chances are it’s ultra-processed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The sneaky UPFs disguised as ‘healthy’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when you’re trying to make better choices, it’s easy to get caught out. “Flavoured instant porridge sachets are a good example,” says Hobson. “Oats themselves are healthy, but once sugar, flavourings and stabilisers are added, they slip into UPF territory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for cereal bars and protein shakes, which can be “more like science experiments to be honest”!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many plant-based meat substitutes sound virtuous but are often built on protein isolates, gums and flavourings. “While they can help people cut down on red or processed meat, many supermarket versions are made from protein isolates, flavourings and stabilisers, which is very different to simply eating beans, lentils or tofu,” he says, though admits there are still some that contain whole ingredients like lentils, beans and pulses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-fat fruit yoghurts are another trap: “They often lean more towards dessert once thickeners, sweeteners and colourings are added,” says Hobson. Even snacks that look healthy on the surface – such as lentil crisps, popped chips and baked vegetable puffs – are often extruded, flavoured and bulked out with emulsifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Packaged foods that are actually fine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean you need to avoid everything in a packet or tin. “There are plenty of packaged foods that people assume are bad just because they’re convenient, but they don’t meet the definition of a UPF,” says Hobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 juTIZT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2023/07/24/09/iStock-1395193135.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2023/07/24/09/iStock-1395193135.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2023/07/24/09/iStock-1395193135.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Not all packaged foods are bad news: tinned chickpeas can be a healthy choice" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-107394"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Not all packaged foods are bad news: tinned chickpeas can be a healthy choice&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinned beans, lentils and chickpeas, for example, are usually just pulses and water – sometimes with a little salt – and are minimally processed. Frozen vegetables and fruit are another great option, often retaining more nutrients than so-called “fresh” produce that’s been sitting in the fridge for days. Plain porridge oats are still a healthy staple, as are nut butters made without palm oil or added sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even bread isn’t automatically a problem. “A simple wholemeal loaf from a bakery or made with flour, water, yeast and salt is not ultra-processed,” Hobson explains. “It’s the mass-produced supermarket loaves bulked out with emulsifiers, stabilisers and preservatives that fall into the UPF category.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Hobson notes, “if this is all you can afford, then choose wholegrain and put your efforts into reducing your UPF intake elsewhere, especially if you are trying to feed a large family on a tight budget”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How supermarkets and brands mislead us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just the ingredients list that makes UPFs confusing. Hobson says food manufacturers are experts at giving these products what he calls a “health halo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They often use front-of-pack claims like ‘high protein’, ‘plant-based’ or ‘fortified with vitamins’,” he explains. “These claims are permitted under UK labelling law and must meet certain criteria, but they can distract from the bigger picture, which is that the product may still be built from refined starches, sweeteners, emulsifiers and gums.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 dHDAGL"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/26/GettyImages-2158918098.jpeg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/26/GettyImages-2158918098.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/28/9/26/GettyImages-2158918098.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Tinned foods get a bad rap, but beans, lentils, chickpeas and even fish are often minimally processed and make for smart, budget-friendly staples" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-107395"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Tinned foods get a bad rap, but beans, lentils, chickpeas and even fish are often minimally processed and make for smart, budget-friendly staples&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (AFP/Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other tricks include highlighting what the product doesn’t contain – “low fat”, “sugar-free” or “no artificial colours” – and designing packaging to suggest wholesomeness, using earthy tones, images of fruit and grains and clever portion sizes that make calorie counts look smaller than they are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of this makes it harder for shoppers to cut through the noise,” Hobson admits. “The more a product shouts about being healthy on the front, the more important it is to turn it over and check the ingredients list on the back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter swaps for your trolley&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson suggests starting with small, realistic swaps. Instead of flavoured yoghurts, buy a plain base and add your own toppings – fresh berries, cinnamon, nuts or honey. Oats are another easy win: make them yourself with fruit and spices rather than reaching for instant sachets full of additives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-uwxkcg-0 sc-uwxkcg-1 kFyeaj iRwaYP"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-uwxkcg-4 bWnsxL number-length-3"&gt;56%&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-uwxkcg-5 gIRZFz"&gt;&lt;p&gt;of calories consumed in the UK come from UPFs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinned beans, chickpeas, lentils and fish are simple, cheap and minimally processed, while frozen vegetables, berries and fish fillets are just as nutritious as fresh. Choosing microwave pouches of plain brown rice or quinoa instead of flavoured instant rice gives you the same convenience without the extra stabilisers and modified starches. Even your sauces can be upgraded with a few staples: passata, tahini, pesto and coconut milk all make quick, additive-free bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be complicated. “With the right basics in your kitchen, you can build balanced meals in 10 minutes that are every bit as convenient as UPFs, but far more nourishing,” says Hobson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hobson is clear that the aim isn’t to eliminate UPFs entirely. “I don’t think cutting out UPFs completely is realistic or even necessary for most people,” he says. “Demonising them outright only creates guilt and anxiety, which isn’t helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s currently working with a charity to help families with four to six kids, who lack cooking skills and space to cook, to eat on a low budget. While research shows that diets high in UPFs come with greater health risks, it’s important to remember that not all UPFs are the same. The real issue, then, is when UPFs start to displace whole and minimally processed foods that we know are protective for long-term health. “The focus shouldn’t be on avoiding UPFs completely, but on balance and smarter choices,” says Hobson. “It’s not about perfection, it’s about tilting the balance so that the bulk of your diet genuinely nourishes you, while still leaving space for the foods you enjoy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOVVpkUWU5MzdfcUR6MmZxdl9tOWFlb1lWM1JfVGZXVlREY2FWZnhDdWZDZlhrZXpydk03SURRanJ4Vl91eWhoQnNKMU5tVFZyNDJBNkZ4eTc0YlNwSDRIZWNQTHdtZkQ5U0tONmNXOU9RaUNNX1pnMmJUOTB1WDZwR1AxcFp4NXhKaFRwYjdQV25zOTBlZVZ3M1VKa05jY09OM1RxNDA2TEtiaTRqbi1yMnVLSndUYVppNHNqZkZhMVo</guid></item><item><title>CVS和沃尔格林在科罗拉多州限制接种新冠疫苗- Axios</title><link>https://www.axios.com/local/denver/2025/08/29/colorado-covid-vaccines-prescription-cvs-walgreens</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Sat, 30 Aug 2025 03:32:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPYnNDb1RnR0lRbXpkVDlTOVBXMFBfaFZHOXVDYnFmaFRDUWFXb0NVNGNrQlR4ZWR3b3ZWdWZ3S0tudjczdFprVkVEODFUdmtpcEltWlpNZWhndVZNUGR5N1haZ2R2Y3E4YXFuZGpJMUZ0VEsybGtzVlh2MDBlRW10dlJKRFhMZTFGY09idDUzMWJnQnROVWVOREt0aWI</guid></item><item><title>我因为和狗睡觉而感染了致命的感染，使我毁容-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15036609/flesh-eating-bacteria-sepsis-dog-bite-reddit.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A man who suffered a bite from his dog contracted the life-threatening infection &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-89706950-8449-11f0-afe1-ad8a3fe21a15"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; and has been left permanently disfigured.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man, from Australia, was asleep in his bed when his dog laid down next to him.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's unclear what bacteria exactly caused the infection, but doctors told the man it 'lives on human skin.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 1,000 species of bacteria are naturally found on human skin and are generally harmless. The most common are Staphylococcus aureus (staph) and Streptococcus pyogenes (strep), which live inside the nose and on the skin of between 10 and 30 percent of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treating the man estimated there was just a one in 10,000 chance the bacteria would enter his bloodstream through an opening like a dog bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man wrote in a &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1mnxjeu/i_survived_necrotising_fasciitis_and_septic_shock/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt;: '[Doctors] told me that it was almost certainly not from his mouth but from my skin.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Group A Streptococcus (GAS) bacteria is the most common cause of necrotizing fasciitis, in which bacteria eats at skin, muscle and tissue until they shrivel up and die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It kills about one in five patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'I knew as soon as I woke up and looked at my arm that I was in a lot of trouble. I'm lucky I woke up in time, if I'd stayed asleep I wouldn't be here.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His arm had turned 'bright red' and tripled in size. It was also covered in coin-sized pustules. Despite the alarming appearance, he only had minimal pain that felt like a sunburn, though he was also dizzy and nauseous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria entering the man's bloodstream triggered a whole-body immune reaction, called sepsis, which affects 350,000 Americans every year and kills one every 90 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The blurred image shows the man's arm with skin torn away and his tendons showing due to the flesh-eating bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis is usually treated with antibiotics for the underlying infection and medications called vasopressors, which divert blood flow back to vital organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, this takes blood from 'non-vital' areas like limbs, increasing the risk of tissue death and amputations. This is why the man's blood pressure dropped dangerously low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being rushed into surgery, doctors managed to save his arm, 'although it was close going,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though the infection didn't reach the bone, in the past four years, he's undergone 20 surgeries to remove dead tissue, graft skin from other parts of his body on to the affected arm and reconstruct his hip and Achilles tendon due to long-term damage from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said his arm has regained 'about 90 percent function,' but he needs regular monitoring due to lasting organ damage from the sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The man said: 'We're still trying to quantify exactly how bad the damage is, but at this stage I'm pretty optimistic. My final liver scan is this Friday, my kidneys appear to be ok, heart only took minor damage, brain is still a question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm slower than I was, and struggling with memory a bit, but I'm still pretty medicated.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The man said he has had 20 surgeries to repair the damage.

Feverish and vomiting, he initially thought he had just contracted a stomach bug, but then discovered a series of blackening sores spreading across his left leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In what turned out to be a life-saving move, he went straight to his family doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Lyons tells CNN his doctor immediately knew "exactly what it was" and sent him straight to the emergency room. In the "matter of maybe an hour," Lyons found himself in the hospital's operating room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That small scratch on Lyons' leg became the entryway for Vibrio vulnificus, also known as flesh-eating bacteria. Those black sores on his leg signified necrotizing fasciitis, which "affects the tissue under your skin," according to the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These potentially deadly bacteria are naturally found and thrive in coastal waters during the warmer months, especially in brackish waters, where fresh water meets the sea, according to the US Centers for Disease and Control Prevention. Once largely confined to the Gulf Coast, cases have surged along the East Coast, with an 800% increase from 1988 to 2018, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;50/50 chance of survival&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Do I have permission to do what I need to do to save your life?" Lyons' doctor asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These were the last words Lyons recalled hearing before surgery. He immediately understood the seriousness of the situation and realized his leg may have to be amputated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I was given a 50/50 chance of coming out of the hospital alive at that point," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;His surgeons were able to both cut away the infection and save Lyons' leg. After three days in the intensive care unit, three weeks in the hospital and various antibiotics, he was "cleared of the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;It has been more than three months since he contracted the flesh-eating bacteria, yet his recovery is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Recovery has not been comfortable for Lyons, who has diabetes; he describes it as a "misery." Yet, he remains hopeful that a skin graft will be the final step in getting his leg back to "normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vibrio vulnificus should generally not pose a fatal risk to the average person, Mississippi's State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney tells CNN. People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of contracting an infection, Edney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you plan to be in coastal water, assume it is contaminated with Vibrio and avoid the water if you have "cuts or wounds that could be potentially infected," according to Edney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, Vibrio infection doesn't occur only through wound-to-water contact. It can also stem from consuming certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;The tiny print on the menu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"CONSUMING RAW OR UNDERCOOKED MEATS, POULTRY, SEAFOOD, SHELLFISH OR EGGS MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF FOODBORNE ILLNESS, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This warning, often found in small print at the bottom of restaurant menus, may look familiar. In Louisiana, this specific warning must be "clearly visible" at all establishments that sell or serve raw oysters - with few exceptions - according to the Louisiana Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vibriosis can also be contracted by eating raw or undercooked shellfish. Most often it's a less serious infection from a different type of the bacteria, causing only stomach discomfort, but can occasionally find its way into the bloodstream, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Oysters get their food by filtering out sea water. When that water is ripe with bacteria, a single oyster could contain as many as a million Vibrio vulnificus cells, according to Dr. Jim Oliver, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;The broader risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Though it's rare, "many people with Vibrio vulnificus infection can get seriously ill and need intensive care or limb amputation. About 1 in 5 people with this infection die, sometimes within a day or two of becoming ill," according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Louisiana was one of the first states to bring attention to this infection this season after it saw a spike in cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;By the end of July, officials reported 17 hospitalizations and four deaths among Louisiana residents, more than double what they typically see. At least three more cases were reported in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This potentially deadly bacteria is not just unique to the Gulf states and is being found farther north as water temperatures rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The Massachusetts Department of Public Health identified an "extremely rare" case of Vibrio vulnificus from a resident exposed to coastal water near Martha's Vineyard. So far this year, Massachusetts has confirmed 71 cases, with a 30% hospitalization rate and no deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Massachusetts, however, is not the only East Coast state reporting increased cases. Virginia Department of Health officials say cases of vibriosis across its residents have been "increasing over the last ten years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Cases in North Carolina have increased 620% over the past 10 years, and New York's have more than tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scientists link this trend to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Climate change fuels the spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The oceans are getting warmer and sea level is rising because of human-caused climate change, and scientists warn these factors are increasing the risk of Vibrio infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Oliver, the UNC Charlotte professor, added that melting glaciers are lowering ocean salinity - another factor that increases the threat. "Open sea salt water has too high of a salinity rate for Vibrio vulnificus," he explained. But when fresh water dilutes it, the "conditions become more favorable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As the climate warms, more bacteria stays alive through the winter, which worsens outbreaks in the summer because we're starting from an already elevated level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Rachel Noble, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied Vibrio since the early 2000s, told CNN the increased prevalence of this potentially deadly bacterium is being "repeated globally," indicating a "complexity of issues related to climate change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This isn't going to be the only pathogen that increases in the face of climate change," Noble said. "It's just one example, but one we can really learn from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="RxNCg ykkUm PvZ nIjPJ PMXYp LmsHF SfAHY mNgye lNbol LBPRq rBLIK "&gt;Awareness saves lives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Lyons is encouraging others to learn about Vibrio and hopes local leaders will spread awareness by posting additional signage to warn both residents and visitors. Any wounds, even a tiny scratch, should be thoroughly washed with soap and clean running water, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I hope my story helps people understand what to look out for," Lyons said. It might even "save a life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If you develop symptoms, "seek help immediately and get to the emergency room," Lyons urges. "That's the best thing. Just go there and hopefully you'll see someone who will recognize it for what it is, because a misdiagnosis can be a death sentence.

&lt;p&gt;The McHenry County Department of Health is investigating after two people and an animal were exposed to a rabid bad in northwest suburban Cary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two individuals and animal were exposed on Thursday, marking the county's first case of human exposure this year, the Department of Health said in a Facebook post. The two people were receiving "post-exposure treatment," officials said. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/diseases-a-z-list/diseases/rabies.html?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExanVpUkNKbFY1UmJGTDV4UAEeQRSB_0H7HZguGEolKWWPs9jfpyM4ybeqP6UgPrN3UAOs0lW1sCIxVmr2sPY_aem_o_3zGGZh-5aUi3JQXKwpXg"&gt;the Illinois Department of Public Health,&lt;/a&gt; most recent cases of human rabies in the U.S. have been caused by rabid bats. While most bats don't have rabies, the following signs could indicate a bat is more likely to be infected than others:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seen during the day&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Found in a place where bats usually aren't present (For example - a room in your home, on your lawn)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unable to fly &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People usually know when they have been bitten by a bat, but that's not always the case. According to IDPH, bats have very small teeth - and the marks they make aren't always easy to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in close proximity to a bat and aren't sure you've been exposed, you're encouraged to call your doctor or local health department to determine whether that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State officials recommend the following steps to protect yourself, other people and animals from rabies:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not feed, touch or adopt wild animals or stray dogs or cats&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vaccinated pets serve as a buffer between rabid wildlife and humans, so be sure dogs and cats are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not allow pets to roam free&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Do not attract wild animals to your home or yard. Store bird seed or other animal feed in containers with tight-fitting lids. Feed pets indoors. Make sure garbage cans are tightly capped. Board up any openings to your attic, basement, porch or garage. Cap chimneys with screens&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encourage children to immediately tell an adult if they are bitten or scratched by an animal. Teach children not to approach or to touch any animal they do not know&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Report all animal bites to local animal control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new study released Friday found that young children diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, are often prescribed medication too quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Stanford Medicine and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2838257?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=082925" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Network Open, examined the health records of nearly 10,000 preschool-aged children ages 3 to 5 between 2016 and 2023 who were diagnosed with &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adult-adhd-diagnosis-children-genetics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ADHD is a disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, or what we call hyperactivity, which is sort of like kids that have a hard time sitting still, they have a lot of energy," explained Jamie Howard, a senior clinical psychologist with the Child Mind Institute, which specializes in treating anxiety and mood disorders in children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard, who was not involved in the study, said that when treating ADHD in young children, clinical guidelines call for starting with "behavioral intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We always want to start with the lowest possible harm," Howard said. "It does very little harm doing a behavioral intervention."&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stanford study found that about 68% of those children who were diagnosed with ADHD were prescribed medications before age 7, most often stimulants such as Ritalin, which can help children focus their attention and regulate their emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The turn &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/parents-struggle-to-find-adhd-medication-shortage/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;to medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; often came quickly, according to the study. About 42% of the children who were diagnosed with ADHD were &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adhd-drugs-teens-misuse-adderall-ritalin-stimulants-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;prescribed drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; within 30 days of diagnosis, the study found.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don't have concerns about the toxicity of the medications for 4- and 5-year-olds, but we do know that there is a high likelihood of treatment failure, because many families decide the side effects outweigh the benefits," Dr. Yair Bannett, assistant professor of pediatrics at Stanford Medicine and the lead author of the study, &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2025/08/adhd-preschoolers.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those side effects can include irritability, aggressiveness and emotional problems, according to Bannett.  &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The high rate of medication prescriptions among preschool-age children with ADHD and the lack of delay between initial diagnosis and prescription require further investigation to assess the appropriateness of early medication treatment," the researchers concluded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the vast majority of the young children diagnosed with ADHD, about 76%, were boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that people have an association with ADHD and stimulant medication," Howard said. "...But there is actually a lot more than that. And we want to give kids the opportunity to use these other strategies first, and then if they need medication, it can be incredibly helpful for a lot of kids."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old, who &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/10/fox-news-host-john-roberts-dead-ai-grok-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;refuted AI reports of his death&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, revealed he’s currently battling a serious bout of the mosquito-borne illness that the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warns can be life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; “if not quickly diagnosed and appropriately treated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts said he was diagnosed with the potentially fatal disease on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had been hurting from the top of my head to the tip of my toes. Literally everywhere,” he told People. “I was also &lt;a href="https://people.com/fox-news-john-roberts-hospitalized-with-severe-malaria-exclusive-11799757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beset with uncontrolled shivering&lt;/a&gt; all during my show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-wQoDAMss" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_wQoDAMss"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/america-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“America Reports”&lt;/a&gt; host said he initially thought the symptoms he experienced were “just muscle cramps and aches” until he began shivering. That’s when he began believing he had the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a visit to the rheumatologist, who determined his platelets and white blood cells were both low, he rushed to the emergency room, where he officially received his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought, ‘Of course you have malaria … You never do anything in small measures,’” Roberts said. “But I was a little scared. Malaria can be deadly if left unchecked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know exactly how ‘severe’ it was from a medical classification, but it sure felt severe,” he added. “I have never felt that sick in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;While thanking Fox News correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/trace-gallagher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Trace Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; for filling in for him on air, Roberts said on social media he was “the only person in the hospital with malaria. In fact, one of my doctors said I’m the first case he has ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2,000 cases of malaria diagnosed every year in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

Foshan city has been identified as the epicentre of the outbreak, prompting containment steps that some compare to early COVID-era measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of people in China have been infected, the report said. Chikungunya is spread through the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes in warm, humid climates, but not through person-to-person contact. While rarely fatal, the illness can cause intense joint pain lasting weeks, months or even years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC has urged travellers to protect themselves by using EPA-registered insect repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothing, avoiding mosquito breeding sites, and staying in screened or air-conditioned accommodations. Two vaccines against chikungunya have recently been approved for use in the United States, but pregnant women - particularly those nearing delivery - are advised to reconsider travel as the virus can, in rare cases, be transmitted during childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, an estimated 35 million people contract chikungunya each year, though annual deaths are relatively low at around 3,700. In the US, 46 travel-related cases have been reported so far in 2025, compared with nearly 200 in 2024. No locally transmitted cases have been recorded in the country since 2019, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older adults, newborns, and people with chronic health conditions remain at greater risk of severe or long-term complications from the illness, the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 23:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>简历和沃尔格林根据一些州指南的要求限制获得新冠疫苗的机会- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cvs-walgreens-limit-access-covid-vaccines-required-state-guidelines/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;CVS and Walgreens are now requiring a prescription or are not offering COVID-19 vaccines in some states as the companies attempt to follow state guidelines that require approvals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fda-revokes-pfizer-emergency-authorization/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;has approved&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax for all seniors, but only for younger adults and children with health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, CVS said the pharmacy chain cannot vaccinate those even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada and New Mexico due to state laws and regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Based on the current regulatory environment," CVS said it's offering COVID-19 vaccinations in the following states: Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS said the list of states offering COVID-19 vaccines without a prescription may change at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the other 16 states, CVS said it can administer a COVID-19 vaccination, depending on the patient's age, with an authorized prescriber's prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Walgreens said, "With the recent FDA approval of the 2025–2026 COVID-19 vaccine, Walgreens is prepared to offer the vaccine in states where we are able to do so." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA's decision to end emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine for children under 5 will limit vaccine choices for younger children, leaving the Moderna vaccine as the only vaccine available for those 6 months to 4 years old with at least one health condition. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics released &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medical-organizations-kicked-out-cdc-vaccine-workgroups-acip/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that, for the first time in 30 years, differ from U.S. government advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585?_gl=1*x6sa7g*_ga*NzAzODcyMjAyLjE3NTU2MDg3MzY.*_ga_FD9D3XZVQQ*czE3NTU2MDg3MzYkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTU2MDg3NjIkajM0JGwwJGgw*_gcl_au*NTkzNjQ2NDkxLjE3NTU2MDg3NTM.*_ga_GMZCQS1K47*czE3NTU2MDg3NTQkbzEkZzEkdDE3NTU2MDg3NjIkajUyJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the guidance&lt;/a&gt; published Aug. 19, the AAP said it's "strongly recommending" COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years old. However, the CDC doesn't recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children of any age, but instead says &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-kids-covid-19-vaccine-recommendation/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;kids may get the shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in consultation with a physician.&lt;/p&gt;

GTP provides essential energy for cleaning up dead cells, with a lack of the compound previously &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-022-00717-x"&gt;being linked&lt;/a&gt; to the development of Alzheimer's in aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171918" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171918" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower.jpg" alt="GTP graphical abstract" class="wp-image-171918 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/GTPPower-600x297.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171918" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;GTP is closely related to autophagy, the natural recycling of dead cells.

The compounds also reversed damage associated with age in brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While GTP has previously been linked with neurodegeneration, the study reveals how levels can drop over time, especially when Alzheimer's is involved. The researchers speculate that the combination of epigallocatechin gallate and nicotinamide may return GTP to levels found in younger cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/08/06/uc-irvine-researchers-find-combination-of-natural-compounds-for-brain-cleaning/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-more-green-tea-each-day-cuts-risk-of-dementia-brain-lesions"&gt;a separate study&lt;/a&gt; linked green tea with fewer white matter lesions in the brain, and in turn a lower dementia risk, though the research didn't prove direct cause and effect. Nicotinamide &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1178646918776658"&gt;has also been implicated&lt;/a&gt; in protecting neurons from the effects of stroke and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this research, we know that GTP might be part of the reason why – and that epigallocatechin gallate and nicotinamide could make a critical difference together. It's going to take some time to turn this into a treatment, and it's important to note that this has only been tested in mouse cells &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro"&gt;in vitro&lt;/a&gt;, but the results are encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As people age, their brains show a decline in neuronal energy levels, which limits the ability to remove unwanted proteins and damaged components," &lt;a href="https://news.uci.edu/2025/08/06/uc-irvine-researchers-find-combination-of-natural-compounds-for-brain-cleaning/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Brewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that restoring energy levels helps neurons regain this critical cleanup function."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — Two siblings at Klein Cain High School have been diagnosed with active tuberculosis, prompting Harris County Public Health officials to conduct contact tracing. Klein ISD is also notifying potentially affected families and staff members.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the district was alerted about the cases by Harris County Public Health, they sent targeted notifications to a small group of students and staff who may have had prolonged close contact with an infected student. Klein ISD also sent general notifications to all Klein Cain families and staff.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The affected students are currently receiving medical care and are not on campus. They will not be permitted to return until cleared by a physician or Harris County Public Health in accordance with state health regulations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health experts say tuberculosis is not transmitted through casual contact, such as walking past someone in a hallway. The disease typically requires prolonged, close contact in an enclosed setting to be transmitted. Harris County Public Health officials are conducting official contact tracing to identify anyone who may have had such exposure.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"TB is treatable and curable with medication," the district emphasized in letters sent to families.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein Cain High School contacted specific students and staff members who shared classes with one of the infected students during the potentially contagious period. Families who were not contacted directly by the school have not been referred to Harris County Public Health as potential close contacts, though they may still be contacted if identified during the ongoing contact tracing process.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district noted that, due to privacy laws, it cannot disclose any information that could potentially identify the students. School officials requested that the community respect the privacy of the students and their family.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents with questions about potential exposure can contact their child's healthcare provider, visit the Harris County Public Health Tuberculosis Information site, or contact the county's TB Program at (832) 927-7575 during business hours or via email at &lt;a href="mailto:Epidemiology_Program@phs.hctx.net"&gt;Epidemiology_Program@phs.hctx.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Families with questions about why they received notification letters can contact Klein Cain High School at (832) 375-8503.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

For years, the dependable ways to check patients for Alzheimer’s disease have been PET scans or spinal taps, no blood tests involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both can be effective. Both can also be expensive, invasive, or hard to get. That leaves many people waiting, worrying, and bouncing between appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new blood test aims to change that first step in care. It looks for the same biological signals that define Alzheimer’s disease and turns them into a single score – how likely it is that Alzheimer’s biology is present. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This breakthrough gives doctors a faster, simpler way to decide what should happen next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-alzheimer-s-blood-test-is-huge"&gt;Alzheimer’s blood test is huge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people with early memory concerns start in primary care. Those clinics are busy and don’t have advanced imaging on hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reliable blood test would help sort patients sooner. Some could be &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/targeting-the-gut-might-be-key-in-preventing-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;referred to a specialist&lt;/a&gt; right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others could be monitored while doctors check for sleep issues, depression, thyroid problems, medication effects, or other &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/traffic-related-air-pollution-might-increase-alzheimers-risk/"&gt;common causes&lt;/a&gt; of cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of triage saves time, cuts costs, and reduces unnecessary procedures. It also helps families move from uncertainty to a plan. Not months from now, but much sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s has two key features in the brain: abnormal amyloid and tau proteins. The new blood test examines a form of tau called p-tau217 and the ratio of two amyloid fragments: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3716832/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Aβ42 to Aβ40&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these numbers capture the core biology doctors care about. The result is a probability score that indicates how closely a person’s blood pattern matches Alzheimer’s changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using both markers strengthens the signal. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-024-03084-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;P-tau217&lt;/a&gt; tracks Alzheimer’s-type changes, and the amyloid ratio helps keep false positives in check. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, the result becomes clearer – either likely Alzheimer’s biology or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-blood-for-alzheimer-s-anywhere"&gt;Testing blood for Alzheimer’s anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see how the test would perform in everyday practice – not just in labs – researchers enrolled more than a thousand people in Sweden who came in with memory or thinking concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some were evaluated in primary care. Others were seen in specialty memory clinics. Everyone received the usual clinical evaluations provided in those settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood samples were handled the way a hospital lab would: in batches, on a set schedule. That detail matters because it tests reliability under normal conditions, not just under perfect, hands-on supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comparing-test-methods"&gt;Comparing test methods&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In straightforward terms, the blood test matched more definitive &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/what-happens-brain-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;measures of Alzheimer’s biology&lt;/a&gt; approximately nine times out of ten. Its performance held up in both primary care and specialty clinics, which is exactly where it needs to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primary care doctors’ accuracy in identifying Alzheimer’s disease was 61 percent, while specialist physicians were correct 73 percent of the time,” explained &lt;a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lund University&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Sebastian Palmqvist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This underscores the lack of good, cost-effective diagnostic tools, particularly in primary care, and indicates the potential improvement in diagnosis with the adoption of this blood test in healthcare settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fixed-thresholds-were-used"&gt;Fixed thresholds were used&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team set the Alzheimer’s blood test thresholds ahead of time and kept them fixed. That’s how a real diagnostic would be used in practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No tuning after reviewing the results. No custom cutoffs for each clinic. A fixed cutoff increases the chance that the same test will work the same way in other places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach adds confidence for doctors who &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-may-not-be-brain-disorder-important-data-was-fabricated/"&gt;need predictable tools&lt;/a&gt;. Consistency across settings is the difference between a research project and something a health system can actually roll out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When standard evaluations were used alone, clinicians did well. With blood test information added, decisions became more precise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A negative result in someone with mild, vague memory complaints gives doctors support to forgo invasive tests and monitor for changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-disruptions-could-signal-the-onset-of-alzheimers/"&gt;symptoms progress&lt;/a&gt; to mild cognitive impairment or dementia, a positive result supports referrals for confirmatory testing and, when appropriate, treatments that target Alzheimer’s biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood test does not replace PET scans or spinal fluid analysis. It helps focus those tools where they are most useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-public-should-know"&gt;What the public should know&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a casual screening for people without symptoms. It’s a first-line tool when memory concerns are real and doctors need to decide what to do next. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used appropriately, it can shorten the path to answers for those who need a deeper look and spare others from procedures they don’t need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also fits into normal workflows. A routine draw, a lab run on schedule, and a clear, interpretable score. That kind of practicality is what busy clinics need to act quickly and confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test is already available in the USA and is likely to become available in many other countries soon,” says senior researcher &lt;a href="https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/oskar-hansson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oskar Hansson&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Lund University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Initially, it will mainly be used in specialist memory clinics, and it may take approximately one to two years to implement guidelines and training in primary care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As availability grows, expect specialist clinics to lead the way. Primary care will follow as training, protocols, and reimbursement catch up. That staged rollout is typical when new diagnostics enter real-world care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-alzheimer-s-blood-tests"&gt;What’s next for Alzheimer’s blood tests&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum it all up, this new blood test that reads the biology of Alzheimer’s gives primary care doctors something they’ve never really had: a quick, evidence-based signal that is correct 90 percent of the time to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stopping-alzheimers-before-it-starts-early-treatment-shows-potential/"&gt;guide next steps&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It won’t cure the disease. It will bring clearer direction, earlier in the process, for the people who need it most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For families, that means fewer dead ends and faster referrals when appropriate. For clinicians, it means a practical tool that strengthens decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For health systems, it means aiming advanced testing where it can make the biggest difference. That’s progress measured not just in lab values, but in how care actually feels – faster, calmer, and more to the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2821669?resultclick=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

There are also some &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carotenoids-skin-health-study-11791322" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:carotenoids with provitamin A activity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;carotenoids with provitamin A activity&lt;/a&gt;—meaning they get converted to vitamin A in your body. Vitamin A functions as an antioxidant, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, there’s evidence that &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin A plays a role in cancer prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;vitamin A plays a role in cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt;. But how much is enough? And can too much be, well, too much?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers wanted to know, too, so they conducted a hospital-based case-control study with Vietnamese participants. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers recruited participants from four major university hospitals in Vietnam. There were two groups of participants. One group was made up of over 3,700 cancer patients; the other was almost 3,000 control patients who did not have cancer, but were admitted to the hospital for other reasons. The cancer group included patients with esophageal, stomach, colon, rectal, lung, breast and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demographic information was gathered, as was dietary information using a food frequency questionnaire. From this info, participants’ dietary intake of vitamin A was calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running several statistical analyses, including adjusting for confounding factors, like sex, age and BMI, researchers found a U-shaped association between vitamin A intake and cancer. This means that both the lowest and highest intakes of vitamin A were associated with an increase in cancer risk. The reference vitamin A intake was 85.3-104 mcg/day; this reference marks the average intake for the control group, which had no cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cancers that were most strongly associated with vitamin A were esophageal, breast, rectum and stomach—but not colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study does have several limitations, starting with the potential for recall bias for the food frequency questionnaire—because, let’s face it, most of us can’t remember what we ate yesterday, let alone try to estimate how much of certain foods we eat on a regular basis. Also, because this was a hospital-based study, it might not be generalizable to other populations, nor can we be certain it applies to other ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most things in life, more is not necessarily better when it comes to vitamin A. But you also need to make sure you’re getting enough of this vitamin, because when you hit the sweet spot with it, it’s a nutritional powerhouse. These study authors do not provide an amount they recommend; they only provide the reference intake amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the National Institutes of Health, the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-vitamin-a-and-why-do-you-need-it-11702329" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended vitamin A intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;recommended vitamin A intake&lt;/a&gt; shifts based on your age and sex. And since you can get vitamin A from so many sources, recommendations are given in &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-retinol-11745693" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:retinol activity equivalents;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;retinol activity equivalents&lt;/a&gt; (RAE), which can be translated to certain amounts of beta carotene, retinol and other forms of vitamin A. Here’s how the recommendations break down for adults:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-a-than-carrot-11690733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Foods rich in vitamin A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Foods rich in vitamin A&lt;/a&gt; include carrots, pumpkins, sweet potatoes, spinach, tuna and beef liver. We love that it’s fun to get creative with these ingredients, like we do in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8064194/sheet-pan-carrots-chickpeas-with-tahini/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sheet-Pan Carrots &amp;amp; Chickpeas with Tahini;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sheet-Pan Carrots &amp;amp; Chickpeas with Tahini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/pumpkin-trifle-8730631" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pumpkin Trifle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Pumpkin Trifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/tuna-nicoise-melt-11784480" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tuna Niçoise Melt;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tuna Niçoise Melt&lt;/a&gt;. And the good news is that most Americans are getting enough vitamin A in their diets, so you may find that you’re already in good shape when it comes to this nutrient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, vitamin A isn’t the only important nutrient for cancer prevention, nor is diet the only area that needs attention. And since &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer rates are on the rise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer rates are on the rise&lt;/a&gt;, including in young people, now is the time to start prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society suggests that the major areas of concern regarding cancer risk that we have control over include diet, physical activity, tobacco use and alcohol intake. Regarding diet, an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-an-anti-inflammatory-diet-8764103" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory eating pattern;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory eating pattern&lt;/a&gt; is recommended, as it’s loaded with nutrient-dense foods, like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains and healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in regular physical activity can also reduce your cancer risk, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-to-start-to-reduce-risk-breast-cancer-8725727" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including for breast cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;including for breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And more and more evidence is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stacking up against alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stacking up against alcohol&lt;/a&gt; and tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that too much and too little vitamin A may raise your risk of several types of cancer. If you’re unsure whether you’re getting the right amount of this essential vitamin, make an appointment to talk with a registered dietitian or seek out a health care professional for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also important to take a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-to-avoid-to-prevent-cancer-11758515" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:whole-health approach to cancer prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;whole-health approach to cancer prevention&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/you-just-started-anti-inflammatory-diet-recipes-to-make-first-8770807" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:eating lots of anti-inflammatory foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;eating lots of anti-inflammatory foods&lt;/a&gt;, moving your body more often, getting plenty of quality sleep, managing your stressors, limiting or avoiding alcohol and avoiding tobacco products. If this list overwhelms you, choose one area to start working on and be consistent with it. Before long, you’ll realize the other areas come easier. And while there’s no guarantee you’ll prevent cancer with this strategy, if you do get it, you’ll be stronger and better able to handle what it throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-a-cancer-study-11800558" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 19:47:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE1uaEFFMzYtMTFKQ0Y2a2Y5cWpPTzAza1RSS3pnR2VKSHN0WE5odzFkaEhWVEY4U05oTW8xVXhEbmFTb0hZNkQxUGw4VWJfaFN5LTJXSERaTGMxRVZEbnZCQ21yd0lUMk80ekpOZktn</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎病例，美国住院率上升，但仍低于去年- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/covid-cases-hospitalizations-ticking-us-remain-lower-year/story?id=125016283</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;COVID-19 cases are ticking up in the U.S. as children head back to school and the country prepares to enter the colder weather months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For the week ending Aug. 9, the COVID hospitalization rate was 1.7 per 100,000, double the rate from two months ago, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/php/covid-net/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, for the week ending Aug. 23, 11.2% of weekly tests came back positive for COVID, up from 3.3% the prior two months, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_testpositivity_00" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Despite the increases, metrics remain much lower than in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Hospitalization rates are about three times lower than at the same time last year and the percentage of weekly tests coming pack positive is about two times lower compared to the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, over the past two months, roughly 200 Americans have been dying from COVID every week, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_weeklydeaths_select_00" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There has been confusion over who may be able to receive a COVID vaccine after the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/fda-approves-updated-covid-vaccines-restrictions-receive/story?id=125032817" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;Food and Drug Administration approved updated versions of those shots&lt;/a&gt; for those over age 65 and younger Americans who are at high risk for severe disease.

The research suggests that age, rather than pain type or baseline health, may be the strongest factor in whether patients continue treatment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than half of patients stopped medical &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;cannabis&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;Cannabis, commonly known as marijuana, is a psychoactive plant that has been used both recreationally and medicinally for thousands of years. The plant originates from Central Asia and is characterized by its broad leaves and a glandular hairs known as trichomes, which contain cannabinoids—chemical compounds that interact with the body&amp;amp;#039;s endocannabinoid system. The most well-known cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is primarily responsible for the plant&amp;amp;#039;s psychoactive effects, and cannabidiol (CBD), which is non-psychoactive and has been studied for its potential therapeutic effects.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;cannabis&lt;/span&gt; within a year, especially older adults. Discontinuation was unrelated to pain type or overall health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New research shows that more than half of patients prescribed medical cannabis for chronic musculoskeletal pain stop treatment within a year. The findings raise concerns about the drug’s durability as a long-term pain management option, particularly for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, recently published in &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt; by researchers at the Rothman Institute Foundation for Opioid Research &amp;amp; Education, reported that 57.9 percent of 78 Pennsylvania patients certified for medical cannabis discontinued use within twelve months. Nearly half of these patients—44.7 percent—stopped during the first three months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a retrospective review, following patients newly certified through Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program to determine whether they renewed their certifications or pursued other treatments over a two-year period. Age emerged as the only statistically significant predictor of discontinuation: patients who stopped were, on average, about seven years older than those who continued (71.5 years compared with 64.5 years). Measures of baseline physical and mental health, assessed through PROMIS Global Physical Health and Global Mental Health scores, were similar between the two groups, suggesting that the decision to stop was not linked to overall health status at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pain type not a major factor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what some pain specialists might assume, the location of a patient’s pain—whether in the lower back, neck, joints, or elsewhere—was not a significant factor in whether they discontinued cannabis treatment. While a slightly larger proportion of those who stopped reported low back pain, the difference was too small to be statistically meaningful. The results instead suggest that a variety of influences, including dissatisfaction with treatment, unwanted side effects, or choosing more definitive procedures such as injections or surgery, may be more important in determining whether patients continue using cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-author Dr. Asif M. Ilyas, President of the Rothman Opioid Foundation in Philadelphia, Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at Thomas Jefferson University, and Associate Dean of Clinical Research at Drexel University College of Medicine, emphasized that the high rates of discontinuation show that “despite growing enthusiasm and widespread adoption, medical cannabis does not meet expectations for a significant subset of chronic pain patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr. Mohammad Khak added that since pain type and baseline health did not appear to influence continuation, other factors—such as perceived benefit, daily functioning, cost of treatment, or consistency in product quality—are likely to play a more central role in whether patients remain on cannabis therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Study limitations and unanswered questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors caution that their study, while among the first to carefully monitor one-year certification status for medical cannabis in orthopedic pain patients, leaves key questions unanswered. Specific details about cannabis formulation, dosage, and method of delivery were not consistently documented, nor were side effects, functional improvements, or patients’ perceptions of relief. This makes it unclear whether discontinuation was due to a lack of effectiveness, adverse effects, financial burden, or even symptom improvement to the point where cannabis was no longer needed. They also point out that their sample was taken from a single institution’s patient population and may not represent broader trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings arrive at a time when medical cannabis use is quickly expanding across the United States, highlighting the need for more personalized approaches—especially for older patients, who showed the highest likelihood of stopping use. The research team urges larger, multi-center, prospective studies that collect more detailed data on dosing, delivery methods, side effects, and patient satisfaction, to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from medical cannabis and for how long. Until then, they believe, physicians and patients should approach long-term cannabis therapy with realistic expectations and an openness to adjustments based on early responses.&lt;/p&gt;

The team chopped on polyethylene and polypropylene boards, mixed the released particles into feed, and watched how the gut responded over weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tiny particles, called microplastics, are fragments of plastic smaller than 0.2 inches that can carry additives and hitchhiking chemicals. The results did not look the same for each plastic, which matters for everyday kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-cutting-board-study"&gt;Inside the cutting board study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by Hai-Jun Gan from the School of Environment at &lt;a href="https://hjxy.nju.edu.cn/English/HOME/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanjing University&lt;/a&gt;, used two common plastics, polypropylene and polyethylene – then prepared mouse diets on these boards for four and 12 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene particles averaged about 10 micrometers, while polyethylene pieces averaged about 27 micrometers, which means the polypropylene feed contained many more particles for the same mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By week 12, the diets prepared on plastic carried roughly a milligram of microplastics per gram of feed, and the number rose with repeated chopping cycles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent laboratory work reported that a single cut on a new polypropylene board can release on the order of 100 to 300 particles, which helps explain why older boards tend to shed more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-plastics-different-effects"&gt;Different plastics, different effects&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene did not just ride through the gut. Mice eating polypropylene board &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dishwashers-release-nearly-a-million-plastic-particles-per-cycle/"&gt;particles&lt;/a&gt; showed higher blood markers that track inflammation and gut barrier stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markers included lipopolysaccharide and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-reactive-protein-test/about/pac-20385228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C-reactive protein&lt;/a&gt;, and lower expression of tight junction genes that help seal the intestinal wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene told a different story. The mice did not show clear signs of inflammation, but their gut microbiota shifted after 12 weeks, with a lower share of &lt;em&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt; and a higher share of &lt;em&gt;Desulfobacterota&lt;/em&gt; in the cecum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift lined up with distinct changes in fecal and liver metabolites, especially bile-acid related compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast matters. It points to particle size, count, surface chemistry, and additives as separate levers of harm, instead of a single “plastic effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-polypropylene-boards-and-microplastics"&gt;Polypropylene boards and microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic cutting boards are not the only source of microplastics in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/food-packaging-is-leaking-harmful-chemicals-into-meals/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt;, but they are close to the action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis estimating real-world chopping suggested that people could ingest 7.4 to 50.7 grams per year from polyethylene boards and about 49.5 grams from polypropylene boards, depending on use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers track with the lab result that repeated chopping increases particle release as surfaces become scarred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are not limited to kitchens. They have been &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/glass-bottles-contain-more-microplastics-than-plastic-containers/"&gt;measured in human blood&lt;/a&gt;, which tells us that particles are bioavailable and can circulate to different tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical researchers have also detected plastics in carotid artery plaques and linked their presence to higher rates of heart attack, stroke, or death over nearly three years in a 304 patient cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings do not prove that plastic cutting boards cause disease. They show that human exposure is real, widespread, and worth reducing where it is sensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gut-response-to-different-plastics"&gt;Gut response to different plastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut barrier is more than a wall. It is a dynamic system that includes mucus, tight junctions, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daylight-boosts-the-immune-systems-ability-to-fight-infections/"&gt;immune&lt;/a&gt; signals, and bacterial metabolites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polypropylene particles in this experiment lined up with lower expression of genes that help seal that barrier and higher activity of myosin light chain kinase, a protein that can loosen junctions and permit lipopolysaccharide to enter the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polyethylene pushed on metabolism and community structure instead. Bile acids, the detergents our livers make to manage fat and signal to the gut, dropped in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, specific microbially shaped bile acids in the gut also shifted. That pattern fits a gut liver axis response, not a classic inflammatory spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One plastic leaned toward barrier injury. The other leaned toward ecosystem drift. Neither path is good news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wood-is-not-a-perfect-solution"&gt;Wood is not a perfect solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People switch to wood to avoid plastic shedding. That can reduce &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-escaping-from-water-treatment-plants/"&gt;microplastic&lt;/a&gt; ingestion, but any swap needs basic hygiene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knife scars, moisture, and fat can trap microbes on any surface, and regulators have wrestled with these tradeoffs for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food safety guidance has long noted that wooden boards behave differently from scarred plastics and can be harder or easier to sanitize depending on use and cleaning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is routine cleaning, separation of raw and ready-to-eat foods, and timely replacement of boards that are deeply grooved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-weigh-plastic-risks"&gt;How to weigh plastic risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on the limited evidence available, chemicals and biofilms associated with microplastics in drinking-water pose a low concern for human health,” according to the World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that is drinking water, not food, and it reflects what we know today, not a permanent verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where kitchen practice and common sense meet science. Replace old plastic boards more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoid harsh scraping that chews up surfaces. Keep raw meat, seafood, and produce on separate boards, and clean thoroughly with hot water and detergent after each use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a bigger picture. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/"&gt;Plastics&lt;/a&gt; differ by polymer and additives, and they age in different ways.

&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old, who &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/10/fox-news-host-john-roberts-dead-ai-grok-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;refuted AI reports of his death&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, revealed he’s currently battling a serious bout of the mosquito-borne illness that the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/treatment/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;warns can be life-threatening&lt;/a&gt; “if not quickly diagnosed and appropriately treated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roberts said he was diagnosed with the potentially fatal disease on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had been hurting from the top of my head to the tip of my toes. Literally everywhere,” he told People. “I was also &lt;a href="https://people.com/fox-news-john-roberts-hospitalized-with-severe-malaria-exclusive-11799757" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beset with uncontrolled shivering&lt;/a&gt; all during my show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-papQS7n5" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_papQS7n5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/america-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;“America Reports”&lt;/a&gt; host said he initially thought the symptoms he experienced were “just muscle cramps and aches” until he began shivering. That’s when he began believing he had the flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a visit to the rheumatologist, who determined his platelets and white blood cells were both low, he rushed to the emergency room, where he officially received his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I thought, ‘Of course you have malaria … You never do anything in small measures,'” Roberts said. “But I was a little scared. Malaria can be deadly if left unchecked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know exactly how ‘severe’ it was from a medical classification, but it sure felt severe,” he added. “I have never felt that sick in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;While thanking Fox News correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/person/g/trace-gallagher" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Trace Gallagher&lt;/a&gt; for filling in for him on air, Roberts said on social media he was “the only person in the hospital with malaria. In fact, one of my doctors said I’m the first case he has ever seen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are approximately &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2,000 cases of malaria diagnosed every year in the U.S&lt;/a&gt;., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was recently published in &lt;em&gt;Neurocomputing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dysarthria is a common early symptom of various neurological disorders. Given that these speech abnormalities often reflect underlying neurodegenerative processes, voice signals have emerged as promising non-invasive biomarkers for early screening and continuous monitoring of such conditions. Automated speech analysis offers high efficiency, low cost, and non-invasiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, current mainstream methods often suffer from over-reliance on handcrafted features, limited capacity to model temporal-variable interactions, and poor interpretability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges, the team proposed Cross-Time and Cross-Axis Interactive Transformer (CTCAIT) for multivariate time series analysis. This framework first employs a large-scale audio model to extract high-dimensional temporal features from speech, representing them as multidimensional embeddings along time and feature axes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It then leverages the Inception Time network to capture multi-scale and multi-level patterns within the time series. By integrating cross-time and cross-channel multi-head attention mechanisms, CTCAIT effectively captures pathological speech signatures embedded across different dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method achieved a detection accuracy of 92.06% on a Mandarin Chinese dataset and 87.73% on an external English dataset, demonstrating strong cross-linguistic generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the team conducted interpretability analyses of the model’s internal decision-making processes and systematically compared the effectiveness of different speech tasks, offering valuable insights for its potential clinical deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These efforts provide important guidance for potential clinical applications of the method in early diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this AI and neurology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a4c5cacadddeccc5cbe4cdd4d48ac5c78ac7ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Weiwei Zhao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ipp.ac.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Weiwei Zhao – Chinese Academy of Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2025.130708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Multivariate time series approach integrating cross-temporal and cross-channel attention for dysarthria detection from speech&lt;/a&gt;” by LI Hai et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurocomputing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multivariate time series approach integrating cross-temporal and cross-channel attention for dysarthria detection from speech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech analysis offers a non-invasive, low-cost approach to dysarthria detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that the temporal correlations within speech signals and the interactions among the multidimensional feature variables derived from them can facilitate dysarthria detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, current studies either rely on pre-designed feature sets, which depend heavily on cumbersome feature engineering, or focus solely on spectral or high-dimensional audio vectors that capture temporal dependencies while neglecting the interactions between internal multivariate features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose an end-to-end method that utilizes audio pre-trained models as multivariate time series feature extractors, combined with InceptionTime and cross-temporal and cross-channel attention mechanisms, to fully capture temporal dependencies and interactions among variables within speech for accurate dysarthria detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results show that the proposed method achieves a detection accuracy of 92.06 % on a local Mandarin dysarthria dataset, which is at least 2.17 percentage points higher than previous studies, with the highest stability and the lowest time cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it achieves an accuracy of 87.73 % on an external English dataset, demonstrating good cross-linguistic adaptability and generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, experiments show that in connected speech tasks, structured tasks outperform unstructured ones in leveraging interactions, leading to more effective dysarthria detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed end-to-end dysarthria detection method, further advancing the development of speech analysis as a promising tool for dysarthria screening.&lt;/p&gt;

But clinic leaders believe it’s a matter of time before it thrives like the locations in Eagan, Vadnais Heights and Woodbury that are staffed with ER doctors and have advanced imaging and lab capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The approach might be overkill for most patients with typical urgent care needs, such as tests for strep throat or persistent cough, but it saves time and money when treating patients with complex conditions who otherwise visit crowded hospitals, said Dr. Craig Matticks, the Urgency Room’s medical director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;“What we’re really good at in emergency medicine is figuring out what people have and figuring out what people need,” he said. “We’re bringing that into the outpatient setting for all those patients that don’t actually need immediate, critical interventions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The Urgency Room, a doctor-owned private practice, has grown despite competing in an urgent care marketplace dominated by large multispecialty health systems like Allina Health, HealthPartners and M Health Fairview. Each of the east metro Urgency Room locations treats more than 30,000 patients per year, Matticks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Emergency Physicians P.A.

The medical group started in the east metro to avoid competition with the hospital ERs at which its doctors work on contract, including Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park, Southdale Hospital in Edina and North Memorial in Robbinsdale. But Matticks said they had been planning for years to add a west metro location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Physician-owned treatment centers have &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2023-03-28-select-financial-operating-and-patient-characteristics-pohs-compared-non-pohs-fact-sheet"&gt;faced criticism from community hospitals&lt;/a&gt; because they often set up in wealthier suburbs and limit their exposure to low-income and uninsured patients. The Urgency Room takes low-income patients covered by Minnesota’s Medical Assistance program and uninsured patients, though they must submit a $350 deposit before receiving care, according to &lt;a href="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.urgencyroom.com/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions/"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box   article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;EPPA’s urgent care model is unusual, but it’s responding to the same consumer demands that have resulted in more urgent care clinics nationally and also standalone emergency rooms, said Allan Baumgarten, a &lt;a href="https://allanbaumgarten.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://allanbaumgarten.com/"&gt;Twin Cities analyst&lt;/a&gt; of health care markets.

						&lt;p&gt;It is a month since we returned home from the Appalachian Trail. In truth, it has been a pretty chaotic month but we both feel pretty settled with it. Early in the month, both of us temporarily lost the memory the hike as a recent event. Strangely, when we thought about &lt;em&gt;The Trail&lt;/em&gt;, it was like a foggy memory. Now, it seems like something in the past but not a foggy past. As a psychologist, I know this is a process called&lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/sleeps-crucial-role-in-preserving-memory/"&gt;&lt;em&gt; memory stabilization&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which new, easily disrupted memories are transformed into more resilient ones that are not subject to interference. Memories of specific events or experiences, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079906/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;episodic memory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, blends with semantic (fact) memory and is encoded by the brain’s hippocampus and the neocortex.  The next step is &lt;em&gt;memory consolidation &lt;/em&gt;in which new neuronal pathways are formed. These pathways assure the information is stored, and can be retrieved, from long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our memories consolidate, we are contented with being home, and with the hike. Packrat, the owner of Hikers Welcome Hostel in Glenncliff, NH, sent us this week a photo he took of us. When we look at it, it sums up our years together, the hike, and the goodness we have post-hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Consolidating Our Experiences&lt;/h3&gt;

But because a psychologically rich life is the accumulation of rich experiences, it is important to journal, photograph and share them with others to maintain your memories. . . “As long as you are curating and storing your experiences in your psychological memorabilia, then you are enriching yourself every day” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;
&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;
&lt;p class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;A good life is typically thought of as being a happy one or a meaningful one. Recent research suggests another type of good life is a &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/rev-rev0000317.pdf"&gt;psychologically rich one &lt;/a&gt;characterized by novel experiences, perspective-shifting insights, and complexity even though it may have more discomfort and challenges than other models. As hikers who voluntarily take on hard things, that rings true to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;When we set about to regather ourselves a few years ago, we took on the cornerstones of a healthy life addressing our physical, emotional and social wellbeing through nutrition, sleep, exercise and relationships. As we gained a deeper understanding of taking care of not only others, but ourselves also, we grew more mindful of how these things interact in our lives moment to moment. It is in part the luxury of aging, but we knew if we did not attend to these pillars of health, we would dwindle or die and not at some distant time in the future. That is a gift of aging. When you are younger, it can be harder to see our endpoints at humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;As we tried to think about how to share our transition back to “real life” with you, we decided it made sense to organize the experience on those pillars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="null" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTE6EFE3V5AULPCYHOOWS3HDPA" data-el="text"&gt;Over the past month, we have felt stress trying to take care of what we think of as deferred maintenance of our physical space, paperwork, our relationships, and even doctors appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sleep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some memory consolidation is taking place continuously, because, like a computer, we cannot retain but so much information in our short term memory. Big events need more time to “settle in” to our collected memories than routine ones. This is partly because we forget ordinary stuff, it was ordinary, so we don’t spend much biological effort to catalogue it. We can easily link it to our existing cognitive frameworks (&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-a-schema-2795873"&gt;schemas&lt;/a&gt;). Things that don’t fit well tend to require more effort to consolidate. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3079906/"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; is a key element of successful &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10807868/"&gt;memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew we would need to sleep a lot. Both science and experience has taught us sleep is a magic elixir for pain and grumpiness. It works for people of all ages but somehow, we forget and think it just applies to cranky toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps our crowning achievement as a couple has been to learn that stress makes us cranky and it is not personal. Of course, we don’t always adhere to that tenet, but we try. We have spent a lot of effort learning to say, “I feel cranky because of the stress of X,Y,Z”.  It does not fix the stress or the crankiness, but it does call time out for a moment. It works a lot better than snapping each others heads off and then apologizing. We have plenty of experience with both methods and can strongly recommend identifying the crankiness and, well, taking a nap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first couple of weeks it seemed like we were just eating and sleeping every moment that was not claimed by a deferred maintenance task. The Historian was sleeping more like a cat than a human, 13 to 15 hours a day. Just about the time I was getting frantic that he might not be OK, he woke up feeling normal and was much easier to be around than when his “I need a nap” period started. Between sleep and a little chiropractic care, The Historian’s back and my hip and shoulder pains are healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiously, our sleep quality was lower than on the trail for a few weeks home. A review of our fitness watch sleep data demonstrates the process. For the first week after the hike, we blew off our poorer than normal sleep attributing it to all the movement from place to place and shifting from sleeping pads back to a bed. That was followed by a couple of weeks of higher than normal sleeping heart rates and lower than normal &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt;. We are finally returning to our pre-hike baseline and feel much more “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have discussed what might be the cause, but came to no conclusion. We considered that it was stress of too much deferred maintenance, or easy access to too much food too close to bedtime, or even not observing hiker midnight since we had electric lights. We also thought it might be related to exercise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Peaking, and Overtraining&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we figured out in our memory consolidation was that our athletic ability peaked at different times on the journey. Timing your peak for an athletic event is some science and some guessing and some luck, as any competitive athlete can tell you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was peaking as we approached Katahdin. A couple of weeks before we got there, I suddenly was filled with energy and the knowledge I could hike on for weeks more. Earlier in the trip, I had moments of serious doubt that I could ever feel good distance hiking. I never doubted I would have the resolve to go to the end, but I also wondered if it would always hurt and be a drudge to hike. This is not the same as getting “trail legs.” We reached a point at about 6 weeks when we could grind out more miles in fewer hours, what we considered trail legs. What happened at about 2 1/2 months was more like, “Oh, yes! I remember how to be a distance hiker.” I realized I could have hiked on for months before I fell apart. Even my fitness watch considered 10 mile days with a pack as “not exercise,” advising me to increase my exercise load if I wanted to improve my fitness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Historian peaked much earlier than I and then reached a state of &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/what-to-know-about-overtraining"&gt;overtraining&lt;/a&gt; at the end of Virginia. We were similarly challenged, mentally and physically, with the hike for the first few weeks. Then, he moved ahead in his hiking competence. It was his physical energy and emotional resolve that kept me walking through the physical and psychological injuries I sustained from all the wet. He picked me up off the trail many times, literally and figuratively. Toward the end, he simply had no “go” left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, he commented, “When I reached the end of Virginia, I was done.” He did hike some after that, but it was difficult and his body exhibited the classic signs of overtraining including unusual muscle soreness, performance decline, prolonged general fatigue, inability to relax, poor sleep, appetite loss, gut problems, lack of energy, motivation, and flat affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exercise Routine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave us a few days of lolling about and then started prodding us to get back to exercising. We are blessed with a lovely set of hiking and Nordic ski trails near our house. Even when we are very busy, we can get in a good jaunt within about an hour. Typically, after breakfast we take off for a 1 1/2 to 2 mile sojourn that gets our heart rates up. The trail we most commonly do is 1.5 miles. It roughly breaks down into three 1/2 mile sections, one flat, one 250 feet down, and one 250 feet up. Our typical time is 32-35 minutes with our shortest being 28. The typical exercise load on our fitness watches, depending on the temperature (colder is higher load), is 45 to 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173450/20250801_103146-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-515840" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173450/20250801_103146-700x933.jpg" alt="male day hiker on trail with hiking poles"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started back, we walked through the track in 32 minutes and got NO exercise credit for it. A swift pace on this trail did not raise our heart rate enough to count. An adjustment was required. Now, we are pressing as hard as we can to keep the pace over 3 miles per hour, including the uphills. Some younger hikers saw us coming up the steep section at 2.8 miles per hour and commented that we “had quite a head of steam worked up.” At an average of 3 1/2 miles per hour, we are getting exercise credit from our watches, but I also have a sneaking suspicion that it is not just our increased effort, but that we are slowly losing our trail fitness. It is sad to see it go, but not unexpected. We had hoped to squeeze in a backpacking trip to the Bob Marshall Wilderness before we lost our trail legs, but maybe not. We can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nutrition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most hikers tell stories about the moment they realized they had to change their eating habits–both for the trail, and after returning to real life. Neither of us realized that hiker hunger would last past the hiking part. I thought it would be more like having gotten used to eating more than we need in town than literally feeling ravenous. It took us a couple of weeks to stop feeling like we were starving all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it is shocking that we felt so genuinely hungry given how much we were eating the first couple of weeks. Now, I am not preparing salad for 100 every meal. We were, before the hike, and continue, after the hike, to be big eaters. We eat mountains of vegetables each day to which we add grains and plant protein along with an occasional animal protein. We make a gallon of yogurt each week and since coming back, we have run through the gallon in less than a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Historian struggled with keeping weight on during the hike. We never saw how much he weighed at his lowest, but suspect he crossed below 150 pounds, which was too little for him. We do know his body fat got below 20% and stayed in the low 20% range for most of the hike. Toward the latter part of the trip, his weight stabilized at 160 and he would like to stay in that range. So far, so good. He is eating a healthy diet and a goodly amount of food but not losing or gaining weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continue with my thrifty metabolism. If famine were to strike, I would be well prepared. While on the trail, I reduced my calories to 1800-2200 per day in order to shift food to The Historian. I did not lose weight. I will write more about that later in a blog on our food, but for now, suffice it to say that it does not take much to keep my motor running. I did lose weight while on the trail, but mostly I compacted what I had. I continue to record everything I eat, and have shifted my caloric intake downwards to 1500-1800 calories per day and am maintaining my post-trail weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_515842" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173844/20250825_124237-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-515842" class="wp-image-515842 size-large" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173844/20250825_124237-700x732.jpg" alt="large bowl of salad"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-515842" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;My lunch salad fills up a noodle bowl. The Historian’s was a little smaller, but he added toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who audit our grocery purchases (ha ha), I can say I am proud that we finally got all the quasi-mess we left from dehydrating trail food preparing our resupply boxes cleaned up. The refrigerator is well organized and ready for action to feed us with wet food. We make our own yogurt from milk we get from the dairy down the road and we rehydrate and cook our own beans. The garden would usually be bursting at this time of year but since we were gone during the planting season, we are purchasing more than usual. We still have a lifetime supply of onions from the garden. Kale and radishes are coming along. We hope the peas will come in before the winter hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say it feels strange to reach in the fridge and pull out beans and grains without having to remember to cold soak them hours before. It is a bit of trouble to make yogurt more than once a week but it seems to just disappear. The sour cream in the top right is for one of our resident animals (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175305/20250827_160257-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516801" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175305/20250827_160257-700x933.jpg" alt="Photo of the inside of an organized refrigerator "&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Relationships&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Catching Up With Family&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big stressors for us, and probably for anyone with family, has been reuniting with the daily activity of our families. Everyone lovingly withheld requests for our time while we were hiking. However, there has been a lot of deferred maintenance this month. I have not handled this as well as I would have liked. It felt like an oncoming train. Thankfully, after we got through a stack of doctors appointments and cleaned the house, it is feeling less stressful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elder we provide care for did very well while we were gone. As we had hoped, she gained confidence in what she could do for herself since we were not there to do some of the routine chores we do for her. She, and we, are very proud of her efforts. Unfortunately, the week after we returned, she became ill and spent a week in the hospital. After she was home and assessing the effect of our trip on her, she declared that “it was a long trip” and was hard on her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other family had been waiting for us to return so they could visit. We were able to see my sister on our return home. Another family member came to visit last week and we are scheduled to travel to visit yet more family in a couple of weeks. We had a great meal with family and the mailed Love Gap Cookie friends. I even took a video and texted it to our fellow hiker-foodie Daddy Longlegs who is a SOBO about half-way through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175634/20250822_160411-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516802" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28175634/20250822_160411-700x933.jpg" alt="homemade mezza buffet including flatbread and multiple salads and herbs"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is good to have family, but also requires us to think more broadly than when we were on the trail. Our metaphor for this an insider joke about what to have for dinner. While on the trail, the answer usually was “the heaviest one.” With so much visiting, we have had to think beyond the grams that just the two of us are carrying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During one family visit, we were magically able to get a pass to drive the Going to the Sun Road, which everyone enjoyed, setting aside a little acrophobia–a normal response to the narrow road with few guardrails. Looking into the valley from Logan Pass and realizing that we hiked the equivalent of top to bottom and back up top on an average day was quite shocking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_515844" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174210/20250821_153943-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-515844" class="wp-image-515844 size-large" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25174210/20250821_153943-700x495.jpg" alt="Mountains with blue sky and grass with wildflowers in front"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-515844" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A view from Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Catching up with Friends: Our Coming Out Party&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As regular readers know, in addition to our family, we had a group of friends who supported us on the hike. We had a celebratory meal with this circle of friends, they resolve ones who launched us with the &lt;a href="https://thetrek.co/appalachian-trail/the-pre-trail-to-do-emotions-anxiety-and-gratitude/"&gt;blessing of our rings and hiking trip&lt;/a&gt;. It was our treat, and we brought a sample of trail food and a sample of town food. We also got a great big cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People generally were surprised at the palatability of the trail food. They were not impressed with our chia, flaxseed, and protein powder breakfast although they allowed as how it was functional. The town food was popular but mostly everyone ate cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Animals in Our Lives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we were gone, the animals continued their occupation of our yard. The local bear ate all the apples off the right side of our tree. The deer babies from last year have grown up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_515841" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173704/20250808_103705-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-515841" class="wp-image-515841 size-large" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/25173704/20250808_103705-700x890.jpg" alt="two male deer with antlers resting in front of a wood pile and lawn chair"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-515841" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Last summer’s deer twins born in our yard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the humingbirds changed or if we did, but we have been able to watch them up close in the garden. Perhaps they were always here but our eyes are seeing natural movements differently after being on the trail. I managed to get video of a humming bird sitting on the fence for over a minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180024/20250823_130932-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516803" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180024/20250823_130932-700x933.jpg" alt="hummingbird on fence by pansy plants"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our resident squirrel is also more casual around us. I caught it napping in a tree the other day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180209/20250825_190410-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-516804" src="https://photos.thetrek.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/28180209/20250825_190410-700x933.jpg" alt="squirrel napping on tree"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days home, I was working in the garden and was hailed by a very loud kitten that was living under our deck. We have no idea what happened to the mother or other kittens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kitten was clearly in distress, nearly starved to death and muddy. We could not come close to approaching it, but thought perhaps if we got it inside and fed it, we could take it to the vets and find a home for it. We left it a trail of food into our house and it came in. It loves sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cat has now been living behind the washing machine in our kitchen for a month and we still cannot touch it. It talks to us and rolls around on the floor purring at us but runs when we try to approach. We captured it once by subterfuge and terrified it. Eventually, it did settle down and purred and accept pets but we decided to leave it untouched. For now, we have a wild animal living in our house with us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, before you say we should keep it, no. We should not keep it. We keep eying it, ready to pounce, when it goes after our furniture. We have done cats, but we are not cat people and this cat needs someone who will love it unreservedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, we cannot tell if it is male or female (we suspect male). It needs a name. If anyone has a suggestion, we are all ears!&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;We all know them. The people who make you do a double-take when they mention their age. Not because they've had work done, but because they seem to have negotiated a better deal with time. They move like they're younger, their skin glows without Instagram filters, and they have that energy that makes you wonder what they're putting in their coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: they're not doing anything you couldn't do. No exotic supplements, no $500 face creams, no bizarre biohacking. They've just been quietly consistent with habits most of us know about but somehow never stick to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference isn't what they know—it's what they actually do, every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They protect their sleep like it's sacred&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just getting eight hours—actually protecting the quality of those hours. They have bedtimes that would make teenagers roll their eyes. They've been turning off screens an hour before bed since before it was trendy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/good-nights-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; affects cellular regeneration more than any serum ever could. While you're scrolling at midnight, they're giving their bodies time to actually repair the damage of existing. Their growth hormone is doing its job while yours is struggling against blue light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They treat sleep like a non-negotiable appointment with aging prevention. Boring? Maybe. Effective? Look at their skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They move constantly, not intensely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're not CrossFit warriors or marathon runners. They just never really stop moving. They take stairs without thinking about it. They garden, walk to get coffee, stretch while watching TV. Movement is woven into their day, not scheduled into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This constant, gentle activity keeps their &lt;a href="https://www.visiting-angels.co.uk/middlesex/blog/daily-activities-and-exercise-for-the-elderly/#:~:text=It%20(%20Exercise%20)%20also%20supports%20better,the%20benefits%20to%20cardiovascular%20health%20are%20significant." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;metabolism active&lt;/a&gt; and joints lubricated. They avoid the inflammation that comes from both extreme exercise and complete sedentary living. Their bodies stay functional because they keep using all the functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about workout intensity; it's about never letting their body forget how to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They eat real food without making it weird&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No dramatic diets, no superfood obsessions, no elimination protocols that make dinner parties awkward. They just eat actual food—vegetables, fruits, proteins—most of the time. They've been doing this since before kale had a publicist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their approach to eating patterns is remarkably undramatic. They eat sugar occasionally without guilt. They have wine with dinner sometimes. But their baseline is real, recognizable food that doesn't need a nutrition label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They figured out that consistency beats perfection. Their cells are well-fed, not confused by constant dietary whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They hydrate like it's their job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water bottle always within reach, but you never see them forcing down gallons. They sip constantly, automatically, like breathing. Their skin cells are perpetually plump, their joints cushioned, their organs functioning smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proper hydration affects everything from skin elasticity to cognitive function. But they're not water-logging themselves. They maintain steady hydration rather than cycling between desert and flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lips aren't chapped, their skin doesn't flake, and they never get those dehydration headaches. Water is their most basic beauty secret, and they've been consistent about it for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They manage stress instead of denying it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don't pretend stress doesn't exist—they've just developed actual strategies for dealing with it. Maybe it's meditation, maybe it's walking, maybe it's calling a friend. But they have a plan that isn't "push through and collapse later."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress is aging's best friend, breaking down collagen and accelerating cellular damage. These people learned early that stress management isn't self-indulgence—it's self-preservation. They process emotions instead of storing them in their jaw, shoulders, and eventually, their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They look younger because they're not carrying twenty years of unprocessed tension in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They maintain social connections actively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not social media connections—actual humans they see and talk to regularly. They have standing coffee dates, regular calls with old friends, conversations with neighbors. They invest in relationships like they're compound interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social connections&lt;/a&gt; age people better than any intervention. These folks understood this before the research proved it. They maintain their social network like it's critical infrastructure—because it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their faces are animated from actual conversations, not just selfie practice. They laugh real laughs regularly. Connection keeps them vital in ways no supplement can replicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They protect their skin from the sun religiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not hiding indoors—just being smart about exposure. They've been wearing sunscreen daily since the 1990s. Hats aren't fashion statements; they're face-savers. They find shade automatically, like plants finding light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3790843/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sun damage&lt;/a&gt; accounts for up to 80% of visible facial aging signs. While everyone else was pursuing the perfect tan, they were playing the long game. Their skin cells haven't been repeatedly traumatized by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They still enjoy the outdoors—they just do it without volunteering their face as a solar panel. Their wrinkles are from smiling, not from decades of squinting against sun damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's maddening and liberating: none of this is revolutionary. These aren't secrets—they're basics that compound over time. The 60-year-olds who look 45 didn't discover anything we don't know. They just did the boring, sensible things consistently while everyone else was looking for shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started these habits in their thirties and forties, when the damage was still reversible and the habits still had time to compound. They chose daily disciplines over future procedures. They prevented instead of corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, aging well isn't about finding the fountain of youth—it's about not poisoning the well you already have. It's about treating your body like you plan to keep living in it, because you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people look younger because they've been living like they respect their future selves for decades. They didn't wait for a health scare or a bad photo to start taking care of themselves. They just quietly, consistently chose the habits that honor the body they're in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, more than any cream or procedure, is why they look the way they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="vegou-quiz-after-article" id="vegou-2759822759"&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Your Plant-Powered Archetype?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what your everyday habits say about your deeper purpose—and how they ripple out to impact the planet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 90-second quiz reveals the plant-powered role you’re here to play, and the tiny shift that makes it even more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12 fun questions. Instant results. Surprisingly accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue worldwide. Many patients end up requiring regular dialysis to avoid kidney failure and stay alive. Despite the severity of the condition, there are currently no drugs available that improve kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;
     
     
     &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7587637799"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
     
&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;A research group led by Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine's Professor Takaaki Abe has found a remarkable solution to treat patients with CKD by co-opting a drug typically used for constipation. This is the first time that this drug (lubiprostone) was shown to prevent the decline of renal function in patients with CKD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw3934" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science Advances&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We noticed that constipation is a symptom that often accompanies CKD, and decided to investigate this link further," explains Abe. "Essentially, constipation disrupts the intestinal microbiota, which worsens &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney&lt;/a&gt; function. Working backwards, we hypothesized that we could improve kidney function by treating constipation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, the group conducted a multicenter Phase II clinical trial (LUBI-CKD TRIAL) at nine Japanese medical institutions, enrolling 150 patients with moderate CKD. This study evaluated the effects of lubiprostone on kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that, compared to the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/placebo+group/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;placebo group&lt;/a&gt;, the decline in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/kidney+function/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;kidney function&lt;/a&gt; (defined as the estimated glomerular filtration rate: eGFR) was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in patients treated with 8 µg or 16 µg of lubiprostone.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated the mechanism underlying how this effect occurred. They found that lubiprostone increases spermidine production, which improves mitochondrial function by promoting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bacterial+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacterial growth&lt;/a&gt; in the gut. The improved mitochondrial function was seen to exert a renoprotective effect—suppressing further kidney damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, the research team has plans to validate the trial results in a larger population (Phase III clinical trial) and advance the exploration of biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy. Their goal is to provide each patient with CKD the optimal treatment plan tailored to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery has the potential to significantly transform the conventional approach to CKD treatment, which primarily focuses on reducing uremic toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest a new therapeutic strategy in which laxatives suppress renal function decline. This strategy is expected to contribute to the development of treatments for not only CKD, but also mitochondrial dysfunction disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

The document notes that not all patients will be identifiable as shelter residents, with some using P.O. boxes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Action steps have been rolled out quickly:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li class="nitro-lazy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patients from the shelter should be masked while onsite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="nitro-lazy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare workers are advised to wear N95 respirators&lt;/strong&gt; when treating individuals from the shelter.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="nitro-lazy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest X-rays (CXR) have been deemed the most efficient method&lt;/strong&gt; for determining infectious TB risk.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class="nitro-lazy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The TB Clinic is open for consultation and follow-up care&lt;/strong&gt; for anyone testing positive or showing symptoms.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;A PowerPoint on latent TB diagnosis and treatment has also been circulated internally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, AST/ALT lab tests are being encouraged to speed up treatment eligibility and safety assessments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donna Travaglini, RN, has been designated as the point of contact for TB consultations, and the TB Clinic has committed to evaluating any patient presenting with a positive CXR, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of confirmed TB cases could still rise as testing continues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Maine Wire</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:12:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNLWVqOW93TU16UVg2ZFpVNXZtTkpXcUh6anZ4VWM4MXU0Y25KcjRXa21aQ0wzT1p4N2V2SGoxX2h3cVAtOVZjSmhwQWtVRWhQM3lHQTRWT1pjR3lweUJMNDNNWGMzS0ozTWd4TE5mbmRXYzR2RUNKZGljcnpmQ0RtbWEtakFNSjJoZEFFQ1o1bG5SYXJ2MnNPVGVBOFVxZWxudnAyS2FLU2w3S3Fj</guid></item><item><title>微妙的饮食习惯可能是布鲁斯·威利斯（ Bruce Willis ）患痴呆症的早期征兆-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15046831/compulsive-eating-frontotemporal-dementia.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="author-section byline-plain"&gt;By LUKE ANDREWS U.S. SENIOR HEALTH REPORTER &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Strange table manners could be more than just quirks, they may be an early sign of dementia, experts have warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frontotemporal dementia, the disease affecting actor &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/bruce-willis/index.html" id="mol-280a7c20-84dd-11f0-bc97-090efcca62a4" class=""&gt;Bruce Willis&lt;/a&gt; and approximately 60,000 other Americans, is&lt;span&gt; caused by a gradual decline in the areas of the brain linked to personality and language abilities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs include shifts in personality and behavior, such as impulsivity or a lack of empathy, and language problems where sufferers have difficulty finding words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts say that a lesser-known symptom of the condition is 'obsessive and repetitive behaviors' that can extend to a patients' diet and eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may become fixated on one food, refusing to eat anything else, researchers in DC&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160622101959.htm"&gt; said previously in a study&lt;/a&gt;. They may also eat non-food objects or steal from other people's plates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marilena Aiello, a neuroscientists who researches the condition, said previously: 'These behaviors are problematic, of course, socially, but also with regard to patients' health as they tend to gain weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But], some people lose weight because they eat a narrow range of foods in an obsessive way.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not clear why the condition may cause this behavior, but researchers say it is potentially linked to alterations in the body's signals for hunger and fullness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bruce Willis, pictured above with wife Emma Heming in July 2018, is a sufferer of frontotemporal dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was not known whether Bruce Willis suffers from any compulsive eating behaviors as a result of his condition, but his family has said he is struggling with communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15036003/bruce-willis-wife-subtle-symptom-frontotemporal-dementia-diagnosis.html"&gt;And earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, his wife Heming Willis revealed the subtle sign he started to suffer shortly before his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/video/bruce-willis-wife-emma-heming-willis-speaks-124980747"&gt;ABC News&lt;/a&gt;: 'For someone who is really talkative, very engaged, he was just a little more quiet, and when the family would get together he would kind of just melt a little bit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also soon began losing words, she said, and a stutter he dealt with as a child returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[He] felt very removed, a little cold, not like Bruce, who is very warm and affectionate to going the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, behavioral changes are normally the first noticeable sign of the disease. In Alzheimer's, for comparison, which affects up to 6.7million people,  the first signs are normally memory loss or confusion with time or place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, more areas of the brain degenerate, meaning patients with frontotemporal dementia eventually often mirror those with late-stage Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say that people suffering from the condition may have compulsive eating behaviors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms of frontotemporal dementia include difficulty eating or swallowing, trouble walking and being vulnerable to infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is not normally fatal on its own, but weakens the body and raises the risk of life-threatening infections or other complications. This may include problems swallowing or eating and drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure for the disease, although some drugs and therapies may help to slow the progression of the symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also not clear what causes the dementia, although it has previously been linked to a build-up of protein clumps in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some researchers say it can also be caused by damage to blood vessels in the brain, that they say can affect the supply of nutrients and oxygen to brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 17:10:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxQY1d6ZlVrX2pQeHNMUkFuU3hseEdHTVpoVHBCWHVxMDdvSzBzZWxDalBVZ1dQNUt2TzRnUHB5NVhFSGhRQm1hVzdVTkZGSi1qNjgwS1JIZXQ3OU5Ma3pqVlNRbDNaVXFMenRpOVh5QmYxbDF2UXA1ZVZpUjRfZDdHUUVITUZSS2lfdkRHbzFGRURNSzEyM1RKNUJhMTRZMlnSAaQBQVVfeXFMUC1qMDBDT3RtdUVHdm8zLTdJdTRKUE1xZHRVWGVqOHNUSzlfWFBmWmVqRUJRVjNQLUlCZVVxZldpUWxLbnUzaU9lYVdlcDNyd1V1bU9WZW45TXlnc29fNDFoTFBlUW8wYk95SGZVbEUtaXdBc2pFWU5WaDd3cVBCdU5iREFsNEh0ZVlHSUd1eFR0REMwYjVEbllNVjdBdGMwWWJNd20</guid></item><item><title>纽约市宣布第7例死亡宣布后，哈莱姆军团疫情爆发结束- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/7th-person-dies-legionnaires-outbreak-harlem-114-confirmed-cases-rcna227951</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4d019d" class="body-graf"&gt;New York City health officials on Friday declared the Harlem Legionnaires’ disease outbreak over, a day after revealing a seventh associated death as the patient count ticked up slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-007cf0" class="body-graf"&gt;There have been no new cases among people who live and work in the affected area since Aug. 9, health officials said, meaning the cluster can be considered ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6066db" class="body-graf"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria, which grow in warm water and spread through building water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-407ac5" class="body-graf"&gt;In total, health officials said 90 people were hospitalized throughout the duration of the outbreak, which went back to late July.

In mice, antibody-producing B cells that normally reside in the gut were found migrating into brain border regions, influenced by chemokine signals from inflammatory brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeding the animals a high-fiber diet restored gut immune balance and reduced frailty symptoms, even without lowering plaque levels. The findings suggest that the gut–immune–brain axis could be a powerful target for new Alzheimer’s therapies and healthy aging interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Migration:&lt;/strong&gt; Gut-derived B cells were found in the Alzheimer’s brain, guided by chemokines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; High-fiber inulin restored gut immune balance and reduced frailty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthspan Gain:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber did not reduce plaques but improved quality of life in mouse models.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Buck Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The gut contains the largest collection of immune cells in the body. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research at the Buck Institute shows that some of those immune cells travel along the brain/gut axis in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) providing a potential new therapeutic pathway for the memory-robbing malady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112533"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain, the gut and fruits." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/gut-immune-cells-alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;While the study provides a comprehensive characterization of gut immune system changes in a neurological disease, researchers say more work is needed to see if those changes are a response to brain alterations or whether they drive the disease itself.

We look forward to studying its impact in other diseases including Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was led by postdoctoral fellow Priya Makhijani, PhD, an immunologist who holds a joint appointment in the Winer and Andersen labs. She found that specific antibody-producing B cells, normally responsible for keeping the microbiome and the gut immune system in harmony, were reduced in the mice bred to develop AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also discovered that this cell type has a migratory signature; researchers found the gut-specific B cells and their migratory receptors in the brain and in its border region, the meningeal dura mater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Remarkably, we found that these immune cells in the brain border which recognize bacteria living in the intestines were accumulating in the AD brain,” Makhijani says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanting to understand what was driving the loss of immune cells in the gut, Makhijani and team found that this gut immune cell receptor’s binding partner, a well-studied chemokine known for migration, was produced at higher levels in the glia, the inflammatory cells in the AD brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migratory signature was also identified in human AD brains via data mining of previously conducted studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with collaborators at the University Health Network, part of the University of Toronto, the team conducted blocking experiments in the axis using a small molecule drug, suggesting that a new long-range mechanism might be acting along the gut-brain axis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of a high fiber diet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Makhijani and team found that feeding the animals the anti-inflammatory pre-biotic fiber inulin restored balance in the gut of the AD mice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found these migrating cells were replenished in the gut and that AD-related frailty, including the tremor trait, was reduced in the animals.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that inulin makes short chain fatty acids and other metabolites that concentrate in the gut and can also circulate systemically, she says the diet improved gut health and reduced chemokine signaling in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Again, this involved a bi-directional axis,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winer notes that while the high fiber diet did not consistently reduce the levels of plaques in the mice’s brain, it did impact overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “We did an assay involving 31 metrics of aging in these mice. The diet definitely extended their healthspan, giving the animals a better quality of life,” he says, adding, “This project supports the ‘eat your fruits and vegetables’ advice that is featured in nearly every dietary recommendation.”   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The big picture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study provides a comprehensive characterization of gut immune system changes in a neurological disease, researchers say more work is needed to see if those changes are a response to brain alterations or whether they drive the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winer says one possibility is that age-related insults might trigger AD-causing inflammation in the brain with chemokines signaling the gut immune system for help in dealing with the insult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “In the beginning the process is likely protective, but over time the gut becomes compromised setting the stage for more dangerous types of bacteria to flourish which fuels inflammation throughout the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makhijani is eager to explore the potential of understanding and/or altering the gut microbiome in the context of disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Maybe there is a microbiome that signals an increased risk of neurological disease. Perhaps we’ll be able to identify specific bacteria that set off immune system inflammation. What if we can inhibit the signaling chemokines early versus late in the disease process? Which would be protective for the whole system? This paper provides so many avenues for further exploration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Buck collaborators include&lt;/strong&gt; Taylor R.

&lt;p&gt;COLDWATER, MI (WTVB) – An individual at Coldwater High School was recently diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB). The Branch- Hillsdale-St Joseph Community Health Agency (BHSJCHA) was recently notified and an investigation has been initiated. BHSJCHA has notified Coldwater High School (CHS), and has confirmed the individual is currently undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHS is working with the health agency  to identify potential students and staff from the Spring Semester of the 2024- 25 school year to determine who should be evaluated for TB infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming week, anyone identified as being potentially exposed to TB will receive a notification with recommendations for testing and a health&lt;br&gt;
questionnaire. BHSJCHA, in partnership with CHS, will communicate how the health questionnaire and testing can be completed. Evaluation and testing through BHSJCHA will be at no cost to family or staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your child are not identified as exposed to TB, no action is required on your part, and testing is not recommended. However, if you choose to seek testing for your peace of mind, you may contact your doctor or the BHSJCHA clinic at 517-279-9561 extension 123.&lt;br&gt;
You should Monitor for TB signs and symptoms in yourself or your child. Although it is cold and flu season, TB symptoms can be different. Active TB disease can cause a cough with or without blood, sweating at night, weight loss or inability to gain weight, low appetite, feeling tired, swollen glands, or chest pain,&lt;br&gt;
among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These symptoms can start gradually and not go away for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
