    &lt;p&gt;Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams — who served during the first Trump administration — argued Sunday that "people are going to die" if the U.S. backs away from mRNA vaccine development, after Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. halted around $500 million in research funding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-halts-500-million-for-mrna-vaccine-research/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last week that the administration was canceling 22 mRNA vaccine development projects, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1952851097019633766" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; the vaccines "fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu." The projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Kennedy said the funds would be shifted toward "safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams, who appeared Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," said Kennedy's assertions about the efficacy of mRNA vaccines are "simply not true" — citing their effectiveness in the COVID-19 pandemic, during which hundreds of millions of people took Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know that by the most conservative estimates, upward of 2 million lives have been saved because of mRNA technology," Adams said. "It helped us develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. And it's, quite frankly, President Trump's greatest achievement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mRNA technology was central to Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership aimed at quickly developing COVID-19 vaccines at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic near the end of Mr. Trump's first term. If the U.S. had relied on older vaccine technology, it could have taken an extra 18 to 24 months to develop COVID-19 shots, Adams said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about Kennedy's move by CBS News earlier this week, Mr. Trump said, "Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're Republican or a Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country," while noting that he had upcoming meetings on the topic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams, who was involved in the Operation Warp Speed effort, said it's "fascinating" to him that, as Mr. Trump and his allies discuss whether he deserves a Nobel Prize, "the thing that he should be considered for the Nobel Prize for, his health secretary is trying to undermine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former surgeon general explained that mRNA is a type of natural molecule that's present in the body and operates like a "recipe card that tells your body how to make a protein." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond COVID-19, Adams said the technology "helps us develop vaccines and new treatments" in other areas — from cancers and HIV to the flu and the Zika virus. The funding cuts could halt progress in one of the "most promising areas of modern medicine," the former surgeon general said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These are advances that are not going to happen now," Adams said. "People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;After Atlanta CDC shooting, Adams said "Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams also criticized Kennedy for his response to a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-atlanta-shooting-cdc-emory-university-what-we-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;shooting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; outside Centers for Disease Control and Prevention buildings in Atlanta on Friday. Investigators have been looking into possible motives, including the possibility that the suspect believed he was sick as a result of the COVID vaccine, multiple sources told &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-atlanta-shooting-cdc-emory-university-what-we-know/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How you respond to a crisis defines a leader. Quite frankly, Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test in this regard," Adams said, accusing Kennedy of issuing "tepid response" to the  shooting, while adding, "and that's not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what's been going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1954197860754350238" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Friday, Kennedy said, "No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others." But Adams argued Kennedy has not "unequivocally condemned the violence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's an out there," Adams said. "If you don't believe that people are working to protect the public, then that means it's okay to commit violence, at least in some people's eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former surgeon general said people at the CDC were calling him after the shooting asking him to make a public statement "because they felt under attack." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They didn't know if this was going to continue," Adams said. "They were scared, and they wanted someone, someone who they felt had a public voice, to go out there and say, 'This is wrong. Violence is wrong.'"&lt;/p&gt;

in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.cancer.org/early-diagnosis-surge-for-CRC?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:news release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt; Monday, Elizabeth Schafer, the lead author of the study and a surveillance and health equity scientist, called the findings "promising news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The uptick of cases is likely due to first-time screening in the wake of new recommendations for younger average-risk adults to begin testing for colorectal cancer earlier," Schafer explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is a gastroenterologist, called the findings "really good news," noting that early detection means it's very likely to be curable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they're in the very earliest stage, they're more than 90% curable," he said &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/why-more-colon-cancer-cases-are-being-detected-early/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk='slk:on "CBS Mornings,";elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas' class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;on "CBS Mornings,"&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are symptoms of colon cancer to be aware of — including changes in bowel habits, constipation, bleeding and fatigue — LaPook said proper screening can prevent people from getting to the point where symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If at any point you do a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonoscopy-adr-withdrawal-time-ask-your-doctor/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:colonoscopy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and you find a benign polyp that was destined to become a colon cancer, and you remove it, instead of getting colon cancer, you do not get colon cancer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another lead author, Jessica Star, who does cancer risk factors and screening surveillance research at the ACS, said it's "thrilling" to see increases in screening rates among younger adults as well as its likely ties into rises in earlier stage diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, she warned there's a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Screening for colorectal caner in ages 45-49 remains suboptimal and has not increased equitably by both education attainment and insurance status," Star said in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, medical associations expressed concern after a report that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-preventive-health-panel-concerns-medical-associations/?ftag=YHF4eb9d17" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:may remove all members;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;may remove all members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide insurance companies and doctors' decisions about a range of preventive health measures, like cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Lew, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and attending physician of hospital medicine at Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, recently told CBS News that a change like this would "greatly damage all the work we've done in preventative care, making people sicker, and driving up costs and premiums."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To put it mildly, this is extremely concerning — and doing the opposite of making America healthy," Lew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to CBS News at the time, an HHS spokesperson said, "No final decision has been made on how the USPSTF can better support HHS' mandate to Make America Healthy Again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/israels-security-cabinet-approves-plan-to-take-over-gaza-city-1?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Israel's Security Cabinet approves plan to take over Gaza City;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Israel's Security Cabinet approves plan to take over Gaza City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/why-trump-calling-for-intel-ceo-immediate-resignation?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why Trump is calling for Intel CEO's immediate resignation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Why Trump is calling for Intel CEO's immediate resignation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/2-year-old-hairless-french-bulldog-mix-wins-ugliest-dog-contest?ftag=YHFaf537c7" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2-year-old hairless French bulldog mix wins ugliest dog contest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2-year-old hairless French bulldog mix wins ugliest dog contest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:42:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5rSTZyN18yU3E0MFpNWXgwWWI4ZUZEQnlJbFJRS18zQzlpeEdCSDlEai1LdVNHT1VpaTU1cW1BMkRxUXZVdnJ1M3ZTSzdlTVk4Sk9YYXVPclpQeW1PN3RKRFgtYVQzUTZqYWRuV3lvUmdWd0E</guid></item><item><title>我有一个$ 4,500的全身核磁共振成像来捕捉隐藏的健康风险-以下是它的发现-预防</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBVVkg0X1NIU09vU0xTTW9MNGFCSXZzNWgxTmk1YWtFT0MySnlMVkhIcUJiZnFKa1VEQzM0MXZ5U2tjcjlqamtWMU12Mk5lNkhRNEx6S3VoRXFwdVF3a2xDQmE0UFVjMTc4VnJfc2c5dUlybkY2OE84cXZvTG9tRnc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-zl6cs0 et2g3wt6"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I’ve always believed in being proactive about my health, but like most people, I usually only see a doctor when something feels wrong or if I’m overdue for an annual exam. That changed when I learned about the Prenuvo scan—a whole-body MRI designed to detect serious conditions like cancer, aneurysms, and degenerative diseases before symptoms appear. The idea of a non-invasive, radiation-free scan that could potentially catch issues early intrigued me. Still, I was skeptical. It’s not a medically necessary procedure, is quite pricey (more on this later), and not widely available.

Whole-body MRI, on the other hand, does exactly what it sounds like: It uses the same magnetic resonance imaging technology to take a picture of the &lt;em data-node-id="7.3"&gt;whole&lt;/em&gt; body, which, at Prenuvo, takes about an hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“Typically, imaging is done in a very focused manner based on a specific question that another physician is asking,” says &lt;a href="https://www.prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-daniel-durand-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-daniel-durand-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Daniel Durand, M.D., M.B.A." data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Daniel Durand, M.D., M.B.A.&lt;/a&gt;, chief medical officer and president of Prenuvo Medical Group. “What Prenuvo does is digitize the entire body. You can think of Prenuvo as a tech-enabled, direct-to-specialist care model. We’re digitizing the human body with the most powerful tool, which is MRI, and then we’re having a radiologist do a head-to-toe, on the inside, examination of the patient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;An important note about the limitations of whole-body MRI: “Preunvo exists to layer on top of existing screenings. This is in addition to, &lt;em data-node-id="9.1"&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a replacement of, and we have always said that,” Dr. Durand explains. “The idea is that if you have a primary care doctor and you’re doing your routine screenings, Prenuvo supercharges all that.

This included a whole-body MRI, which covered the brain, chest, abdomen, pelvis, spine, and major vasculature, free from radiation or contrast; a body composition analysis and advanced brain health assessment (taken during the MRI); and a comprehensive bloodwork panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The actual experience of getting the MRI was fairly painless. Before the procedure, I was sent a fairly lengthy survey of my medical history to determine whether it was safe for me to undergo the scan and ascertain any health concerns I may have. I also took Prenuvo up on the offer to take a light sedative before heading in to ease any anxiety or claustrophobia to make the experience more comfortable. Then, I arrived at the Manhattan location ready to sit still in an MRI machine for just about an hour. Surprisingly, that hour went by pretty quickly. They gave me the option to choose a show or movie to watch on Netflix during the scan (I decided on Ginny and Georgia), which helped move things along mentally. Before I knew it, I was heading home, where a nurse from a concierge service employed by Prenuvo later drew my blood for the bloodwork portion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About two weeks after my scan, Prenuvo reached out to schedule my post-scan consultation with &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-vikash-modi-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://prenuvo.com/medical-leadership-team#dr-vikash-modi-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vikash Modi, M.D." data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Vikash Modi, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, senior medical director of preventative medicine at Prenuvo. My virtual consultation with Dr. Modi lasted about 45 minutes, and he walked me through my scan, all of my bloodwork, my body composition analysis, and brain health assessment. He also answered any questions I had and gave me a few suggestions regarding my health moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-25" data-node-id="15" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman standing in diagnostic imaging room featuring a prenuvo mri machine" title="Woman standing in diagnostic imaging room featuring a Prenuvo MRI machine" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-1-6883ba57f3b1c.jpeg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-1am3yn9 e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-dgbau5 e1geg53v2"&gt;Courtesy of Shannen Zitz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About a week prior to officially receiving my results, I got a call from Dr. Modi to discuss one potentially urgent finding from my bloodwork. My blood panel showed that I had a glucose level of 38, which can be very dangerous. We discussed that this was likely due to fasting all day before the bloodwork (which I had scheduled for 3:00 p.m.), as my &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/9731-a1c" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/9731-a1c" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="A1c" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;A1c&lt;/a&gt; (a blood test that measures the average blood glucose from the last two-to-three months) was normal. But I was advised to repeat bloodwork with my primary care physician as a precaution. Dr. Modi then reassured me that there were no other major findings on my scan or my bloodwork, but that we would discuss it further at my official consultation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Fast forward to that appointment: Dr. Modi thoroughly went over my results, starting with my bloodwork, then my scan, the brain health assessment, and finally body composition analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Thankfully, my bloodwork showed I’m in good health, which was reassuring since the blood panel was very comprehensive.

However, Dr. Modi reassured me that the online interface is always being updated, and that the patient-facing side doesn’t always align perfectly with the clinical interpretation. In my case, it may have been caused by head injuries I sustained during my time as a cheerleader. I had no signs of white matter disease, aneurysm, growths, or masses, and overall, my brain volume was very healthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;Scoliosis. &lt;/strong&gt;I knew about this “minor finding” previously from a recent X-ray.

Spondyloarthropathy is the medical term for degenerative arthritis. I have long struggled with neck and upper back pain, and have been undergoing treatment (mainly physical therapy) for a few months now. Discussing these findings with Dr. Modi reassured me that I’m doing everything right in my current treatment plan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.3"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.3.0"&gt;Hemorrhagic ovarian cysts. &lt;/strong&gt;This was my only “moderate finding;” one that I was not previously aware of. While I’m not experiencing any symptoms due to these benign, fluid-filled &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42097713/ovarian-cysts/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a42097713/ovarian-cysts/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="ovarian cysts" data-node-id="23.3.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;ovarian cysts&lt;/a&gt;, I’m glad I know about them now in case they ever do rupture or cause any complications. While Dr. Modi didn’t officially diagnose me, he suggested these may be a sign of polycystic ovary syndrome (&lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27456194/how-to-lose-weight-with-pcos/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a27456194/how-to-lose-weight-with-pcos/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="PCOS" data-node-id="23.3.4" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;PCOS&lt;/a&gt;) due to my semi-irregular menstrual cycle, history of acne, and recent struggle to lose weight. He suggested some supplements I might consider taking and made me aware of the typical treatment and medications doctors usually prescribe, should I ever seek that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="23.4"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.4.0"&gt;Dense breast tissue.&lt;/strong&gt; The scan also revealed that I have dense breast tissue, which means I have more glandular tissue (as opposed to fat tissue) in my breasts, which may make it more difficult to screen for breast cancer with a typical mammogram. I was already aware of this, as I have a history of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a23566271/woman-armpit-cyst-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a23566271/woman-armpit-cyst-breast-cancer/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="breast cysts" data-node-id="23.4.2" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;breast cysts&lt;/a&gt;, which is why I get regular ultrasounds. I was a little surprised the Prenuvo MRI did not pick these up, but Dr. Modi explained that the threshold for breast cysts at Prenuvo is around five millimeters. So, anything smaller than that (which my cysts likely are) would not be picked up by the MRI. “It’s a see-a-lot test, not a see-everything test,” Dr. Modi said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Following my bloodwork and MRI scan, Dr. Modi went over my brain health assessment, which measured the volume of &lt;em data-node-id="24.1"&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; structure within the brain. Thankfully, all of those structures in my brain fell into normal ranges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Finally, we discussed my body composition analysis, which showed data for total muscle mass, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. This test is very useful, says Dr. Berry. “Knowing visceral fat and muscle mass is much better than just looking at Body Mass Index (BMI),” he explains. (Note: &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/weight-loss/a38256590/is-bmi-accurate/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Prevention no longer uses BMI as a measurement of health" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="25.1.0"&gt;Prevention&lt;/em&gt; no longer uses BMI as a measurement of health&lt;/a&gt;.) Again, thankfully, Dr. Modi ensured that for the most part, my analysis falls into “normal” ranges for my age and sex, except that I actually have a bit more muscle mass than average, which is a good thing. This test was really interesting to look at because it included a very detailed analysis of hip and lower body muscle volume, as well as a symmetry analysis. None of this was major, but it did confirm a few things I suspected about the way my body works and moves.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-node-id="26" data-lazy-id="P0-28"&gt;&lt;h2 title="Are whole-body MRIs the future of preventative healthcare?" data-anchor-id="are-whole-body-mris-the-future-of-preventative-healthcare" class="body-h2 css-14d214d emt9r7s1"&gt;Are whole-body MRIs the future of preventative healthcare?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s difficult to say. “The essence of what Prenuvo does, and I think it’s poorly understood, is that we don’t by ourselves prevent anything. But, we can absolutely help a patient choose their own destiny and pursue the right preventative strategies, because we can show them what’s going on in them, as opposed to just general advice,” Dr. Durand explains. However, as Dr. Durand and the Prenuvo website state, there are limitations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;I asked Dr. Berry, an unaffiliated family physician, whether whole-body MRIs can meaningfully replace or reduce the need for standard individualized screenings based on modern-day recommendations. He said, not right now. It doesn’t replace guideline-based screening. “It can’t do what a colonoscopy or mammogram does, and it doesn’t offer the same level of detail. It’s a supplemental tool, not a substitute,” Dr. Berry explained. “If it could fully replace traditional tests, I’d be on board, but the evidence just isn’t there yet.”&lt;br data-node-id="28.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Kazanjian adds that whole-body MRI “tends to be more effective at detecting lesions in the kidneys, pancreas, lymph nodes, and bones, among some others,” but that the screening’s ability to characterize them as benign or malignant may be limited. She adds that whole-body MRI does not effectively screen for some of the most common cancers, including skin cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And while there will certainly be “findings of import on these exams,” including brain aneurysms, evidence of autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndromes, and small cancers, among others, Dr. Kazanjian explains, it’s impossible to say whether whole-body MRI truly leads to improved health outcomes or whether those results would be uncovered via traditional screening methods. There’s also the aspect of incidental or benign findings, which are clinically insignificant (meaning they cause no harm), but create a type of “scanxiety,” or anxiety felt by patients pre- and post-scan, Dr. Kazanjian says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;My Enhanced Screening at the Manhattan location has a cost of $4,500, but it varies based on the exact scan you choose, and sometimes, the location. There are less costly options, like the regular whole-body MRI ($2,500) or the torso-only MRI ($999). Prenuvo also offers its &lt;a href="https://prenuvo.com/warriors-program" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://prenuvo.com/warriors-program" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Warriors Program" data-node-id="32.1" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;Warriors Program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers discounted services to first responders, military members, and veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While some doctors, like Dr. Kazanjian, &lt;em data-node-id="33.1"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; recommend whole-body MRI for high-risk individuals (like those with a strong family history of cancer and/or genetic mutations) and for patients with cancers such as &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a45126444/this-is-what-its-like-to-live-with-multiple-myeloma/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/a45126444/this-is-what-its-like-to-live-with-multiple-myeloma/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="multiple myeloma" data-node-id="33.3" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;multiple myeloma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65530439/classic-hodgkin-lymphoma-symptoms/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a65530439/classic-hodgkin-lymphoma-symptoms/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lymphoma" data-node-id="33.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;lymphoma&lt;/a&gt;, it is generally not recommended for the general population, she explains. “I do not think this is cost-effective for the population, particularly given the large percentage of false positives with the necessity for costly follow-ups,” says Dr. Kazanjian. “I say this even if the initial service were cost-free.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Durand also acknowledges that not everybody can afford the Prenuvo model of healthcare today. That’s why he says Prenuvo is working every day to harness the powers of artificial intelligence to become more efficient, which will allow them to bring prices down long-term.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="35" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In terms of side effects, MRI, including whole-body MRI, is mostly safe. The “scanxiety” and inconsequential benign findings that Dr. Kazanjian points out are the main downsides. As with &lt;em data-node-id="35.1"&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; MRI, it’s important to tell your doctor and radiologist if you have any &lt;strong data-node-id="35.3"&gt;metal or electrical implants &lt;/strong&gt;in your body (such as pacemakers and infusion pumps), as the magnetic field generated by the MRI machine &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551669/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK551669/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="can pose a hazard to patients in these cases" data-node-id="35.5" class="body-link css-inlxvj emevuu60"&gt;can pose a hazard to patients in these cases&lt;/a&gt;. The detailed questionnaire sent over by the Prenuvo team before your appointment covers these in length, and your radiologist will also inquire about any metal in or on your body before your scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“These scans have potential and may help in the future, but right now they’re best for people with high risk or specific concerns or a lot of disposable income,” Dr. Berry explains. “For the average person, they often create more questions than answers. Too much testing can lead to fear, cost, and harm, especially when there’s no clear benefit. Prevention and early detection are very important, but it has to be reasonable and relevant, not just expensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Reflecting on my experience with the whole-body MRI at Prenuvo, I feel fortunate to have had access to such advanced technology. The scan provided valuable insights into my body’s health that I wouldn’t have otherwise had. However, while I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to those who have the resources and are curious about their health, I do believe it’s important to approach it with a balanced perspective. From a cost-benefit standpoint, it’s not yet a universally essential tool in healthcare, and its value largely depends on individual circumstances and priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“The best advice I can give to the people reading this is the advice I live by and the advice I give my patients. This is the same advice I give my mother—and I love my mother. It’s to live a healthy life—keep a healthy weight, eat whole grains and vegetables and lean protein, exercise regularly, sleep seven hours a night, avoid tobacco and alcohol, and get annual checkups, recommended screenings, and vaccines with your doctor,” Dr. Kazanjian says. “Prevention is the best medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-exclude="true" id="journey-inline" class="css-ciejky e1ye6jr30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Prevention</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:32:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBVVkg0X1NIU09vU0xTTW9MNGFCSXZzNWgxTmk1YWtFT0MySnlMVkhIcUJiZnFKa1VEQzM0MXZ5U2tjcjlqamtWMU12Mk5lNkhRNEx6S3VoRXFwdVF3a2xDQmE0UFVjMTc4VnJfc2c5dUlybkY2OE84cXZvTG9tRnc</guid></item><item><title>我赚了六位数的薪水，跑了马拉松，过着奢侈的生活-但我否认我的酗酒习惯......我是一个“酗酒者” -每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxNdTdQU0pDdjZiNm5LM21hcGdvcVNjNUEzU1hNTkFDUXNyQzF2Mzg3TGxlSHc3bHh0TnUzYjZ2S05yTFl6Sk5hLTVLOXlScGlONXR0d1R2ZWgwOU5tMzFycGRyWHlLWDFaSkVGWWhHSk1EZ2NYYzRfUWxQbnNoN0RNTUR3V0xLMXJ1RHg5aFB2NTR1NWk1SDNMcGJ30gGfAUFVX3lxTE5yTHhRYU5LRlAxdzZsWE5nZXdwSXk4bzJQTWNTU1dUNDZOTzJPQmw4MG9jdmgtOXlHeDB0ZmdUX3lYdlRNTlcxT2xiUHo0eU9RY1Y2UVg4bU1mX0ZtWWpnbWpXSE5veVl2bkd1dVNVRzd1czFYalVVOWRlZE1BcHVGemozRFJVbkZjQ0QyOXpJckRwUGJ6MF9hbDhXeTJqTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A woman who was earning a six-figure salary and enjoying considerable success in her career has opened up about her battle with &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-316bad40-72b6-11f0-a220-df039e5e8fdc" class=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; - and the extent to which she kept it hidden from those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra Parker, 56, who hails from Scotland and now lives in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/london/index.html" id="mol-31759850-72b6-11f0-a220-df039e5e8fdc"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;, is a certified alcohol coach and founder of Just the Tonic. Now, her alcohol-free life is a far cry from her old approach to drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra began drinking started when she went to university at the age of 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she had tried alcohol a few times before, it was during her student days that she started drinking more regularly, and in increasing quantities, Sandra told FEMAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This time also saw a social shift taking place, one that would have a significant impact on the drinking habits of many - including Sandra. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The foundation of what would become an addition was laid against the backdrop of the rise of ladette culture, which saw young women rebel against societal expectations that confined them to roles that were demure by embracing more masculine behaviours like swearing, partying, and drinking heavily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Sandra, the new trend was very different to how older women, like those from her mother’s generation, had been expected to behave, and it was ‘fun’ to try and keep up with the lads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her drink of choice at university was a half pint of cider with a large blackcurrant top to hide the taste of the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra Parker (pictured) would drink to excess, then feel awful about it when waking up after a big night out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she graduated and moved to London, and lived in a house share with three other women, they used to drink an alcopop called Hooch, which they bought from the Waitrose across the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you bought a certain number of bottles,’ she said, ‘they would give you a free glass, which we all thought was really cool.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also dipped into a cider called Diamond White that a friend introduced her to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing an advert for the beverage, Sandra said: ‘There was a picture of two girls [who seemed drunk] and one of them was carting the other one around in a shopping trolley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The slogan said they were having “a diamond night out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think nowadays, that would have been seen as really quite shocking. But at the time, it was all a bit of a laugh.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her career, meanwhile, was going well - after moving down to London, she had got a job at an investment bank in Canary Wharf. Going from university to office, her environment had changed - but the drinking remained a constant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: ‘There was very much that sort of work hard, play hard culture, going out for drinks a couple of nights a week. If you got drunk, there was sort of a badge of honour when you went into work the next day.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The popularity of 'ladette' culture, where young women would embrace traditionally masculine behaviours, like drinking to excess, played into Sandra  (pictured) drinking a lot at university then work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra continued: ‘I had a manager, and if we were going for a night out, and someone asked whether we were going for something to eat, he would say “eating is cheating”.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I don’t think people would get away with that now, but then, it was very much like you had to prove yourself, and be able to hold your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I’m not very tall, I’m about 5’3” and about eight stone, so many of the guys were much bigger than me, and there weren’t many women working there. Because it was a career thing, you felt like you were quite sophisticated, but it was still very heavy drinking.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from the booze-fuelled weekday evenings, Sandra live a healthy life; she would eat well and go running - even taking part in several half marathons as well as two full marathons (she ran one of them after drinking the night before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the weekend running was a good way for me to de-stress. I was never particularly sporty at school, but I had quite good stamina for running, and I quite enjoyed it,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think that was also part of drinking culture as well, because, like, I was in a running club, and it was seen as a badge of honour that you finished a run, and you had a few drinks.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that she would sometimes follow eating plans, or exercise regimes, but while she would stick to everything the plan recommended, she would ignore anything about giving up alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra explained: ‘As I was getting older, I was interested in feeling healthier, but alcohol was a bit of a blind spot. And I didn't realise how much it had a grip over me. I thought I was being quite clever by ignoring the alcohol part and focusing on the other parts [of a healthy eating and exercise regime].’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After enjoying cider and blackcurrant, and alcopops in her early twenties, as she grew older, Sandra started drinking expensive wine, and tell herself that her drinking was sophisticated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As she continued to succeed at work, with regular promotions and a six-figure salary to boot, she traded in alcopops and cider for something stronger - and more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There's a place in London called The Wine and Spirit Education Trust,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And I did a wine tasting course there, and I'd been to Sonoma Valley, and had a friend who was a real wine connoisseur. I used to go out with him, and a crowd of others, and we would pretend that we were really sophisticated.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she added, while she said she only drank ‘really good quality wine’, if she went on holiday, she would drink whatever was available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra explained: ‘If I look back, I just wanted the hit from the alcohol.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were times when she would be concerned how much she was drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘From time to time, I would wake up and I would feel absolutely horrendous,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would never go out and plan to get drunk, but there would be times I would wake up and wouldn't quite remember the night before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alcohol was a major source of enjoyment for Sandra (pictured) whether on nights out, or on holiday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would have described myself as an anxious person, and I used to have panic attacks when I was a student, and I would get this horrendous anxiety the [day after getting drunk], and when I felt like that, I always wanted to learn how to control alcohol.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘I never really wanted to get drunk, but at no point did I ever, ever consider giving up. And what happened was, as I was getting older, I think the hangovers were affecting me worse, and I noticed my moods were affected too: I was getting really down and I remember deciding to try harder to moderate my drinking as I still didn’t want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The thought for me, of not drinking was horrific. To be honest, I thought I would be incredibly miserable, and it sounds like odd now, but I just thought there wouldn't be any point in life if I couldn't drink alcohol. So [giving up] was never, ever something I wanted to do.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘I was really good at convincing myself that feeling that way was normal. I know it sounds ridiculous now, but when I look back, I deliberately avoided people, say at work, who didn’t drink. I think there was a part of me that thought “they’re not any fun”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I would try and find ways to convince myself that my attitude to drinking was healthy and that people who didn't drink just didn't know how to enjoy themselves. So I think I did recognise that it was a bit of a problem, but at the same time, it wasn't something that I was that constantly aware of.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On what the people around her thought about her drinking, Sandra said she tried to dismiss it as a serious issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It wasn't like I was getting drunk every night and falling over. But let's say that after work, I got really drunk,' she said. ‘The people I socialised with at the weekend didn't really know. I also tried hard to pretend that I didn't feel that bad the next day. So from time to time, people would say, “you're drinking a bit too much”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But there were ways where I was probably hiding it...If people said, “oh, you got really drunk last night,” I would say that I had felt fine. I would never, ever admit it. I would feel embarrassed.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra (pictured) got to a point where she was being a bit deceptive about how much alcohol she was consuming&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Sandra got to a point where she knew she ‘needed to get control’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She decided to follow a Dry January-style programme, ditching alcohol for a month, but throughout that time, she was planning to return to drinking once the designated time period was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra explained: ‘I was really sick of hangovers. At the time, I was working with a really good life coach, and had been doing a lot of work on my mindset.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Abstaining from the drink, Sandra started to feel better, and started to think that she should try to stay away from alcohol for longer. She said: ’My plan was to be alcohol-free for six months and then a year. But I still really wanted to moderate [my alcohol intake] after that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after she’d abstained for around six months, one of her friends said to her: ‘I can't wait to go out, to go out with you after the year's up. ‘&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra said: ‘I turned around her and I said, “I don't think I'm going to go back to drinking”. When I said it out loud, I was quite shocked, because I hadn't really thought about it. But I thought, “Why would I go back?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think part of me was worried that I wouldn't be able to moderate, but the other part of me couldn't deny that I was happier. I was like, surprised - I was quite shocked, really, to be honest. But I thought, “Look, you wanted to moderate, but like, let's be honest, you're a lot happier now, so why not just keep going?”.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That was seven years ago, and Sandra hasn’t drunk alcohol since - which led to another major life change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sandra (pictured) hadn't planned to leave her job and become a full-time coach, but things changed after Covid, so she decided to go for it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the job that I was doing, I managed people, and I had always enjoyed doing that. I had trained to become a coach, and I was thinking that coaching is something I may do part-time after retiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It had given me the chance to train to help people to get control over alcohol, which is something I was really fascinated by.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And then the pandemic happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Covid was like a big shift,’ said Sandra, 'because I could see how many people were struggling, people’s alcohol intake just seemed to shoot up. At the same time, the company I worked for gave us the opportunity to take redundancy. So, I had learned how to become a coach. I could see all these people were struggling, and I thought, “Why not?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'd never planned to do this full time, but it just felt like the right thing to do. If I'd spoken to you 10 years and you said I was drinking, I would have thought “you've got me mixed up with somebody else”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘If you told me that I was going to be helping other people stop drinking, I would have been really shocked.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite being such a major change, leaving her old job to embark on a career as a certified alcohol coach was such a major change, but as Sandra says, ‘felt like the right thing to do’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The people she works with come to her, which means they have identified that their drinking is an issue, and are in the mindset of wanting to stop. Sandra added: ‘The people I work with are pretty high-achieving, and they're not at rock bottom.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Describing her typical clients, she said they had 'high standards' for themselves, were usually over-45, and beginning to worry that heavy drinking might be impacting their health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Or sometimes they're just realising that for their job, the mental clarity that they need, they're not going to be able to maintain it,' she continued. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the people Sandra works with are successful, it is often easier for them to hide their drinking behind upmarket activities - like expensive wine tastings. Sandra added: ‘There are clients I have worked with who have had wine fridges, who have been really into wine tasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And there’s definitely a demographic where people are able to kind of fool themselves because they’ll say, “I never touch spirits, or I never drink before six o'clock, or I only drink quality red wine”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And there are so many ways that when we do that, we can tell ourselves that alcohol is just a harmless, sophisticated indulgence. But the reality is, it doesn't actually matter what type of alcohol it is.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted that when people start to get defensive about their drinking, or try and justify it, there is ‘probably something there’, that needs further looking at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it comes to the best way to tackle problem drinking, Sandra said: ‘I think some people worry about whether they are an alcoholic. And I think what's good to know is that the doctors don't use that term anymore, so they would talk about Alcohol Use Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So when I'm speaking to people, what I tend to ask is, “Are you drinking more than you want?”. I think that's the first question to ask, because then the amount becomes a bit irrelevant, and it's about whether the person is regularly drinking more than they want.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Now, some seven years after ditching alcohol, Sandra (pictured) wants people to know that there is a different way to approach quitting &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; If they reply affirmatively, she continued, Sandra asks them: 'What would it feel like right now if someone said to you, "Don't drink for a week or a month?" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For most people, if they don't have any problem with alcohol, that shouldn't be an issue, she continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But if you suddenly thought of all the reasons why you wouldn't be able to give up for a week or a month, then that's a sign that is taking a bit of a hold,' Sandra explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her best advice for people trying to control their drinking is simply to be honest with themselves and 'not to try and normalise' the habit.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sandra added that she recommends people cut their drinking down over a period of time, and while doing so, they may notice why they’ve been drinking, and what they are trying to numb by drinking to excess - whether that is work stress, boredom, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is still a stigma around alcohol misuse, according to Sandra, who said one of the things clients often say to her is that she is the first person they’ve spoken to about their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; She added that it is ‘incredibly rewarding’ when people give up alcohol, and you see them go from struggling to seeing their confidence and quality of life surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people who are struggling with drinking, Sandra said: ‘If people have tried to cut down before, and have framed it as being really hard, and making them miserable, then there is a different way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I focus on helping people change their mindset, because if you're not bothered about alcohol, then you don't feel deprived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There's definitely a way that we can look at the different reasons why people are stuck, and we can change those beliefs. And if you change those beliefs and you don't want to drink, you're going to be so much happier than trying and failing with willpower. If somebody had told me that 20 years ago, I would have been delighted.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 12:31:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNdTdQU0pDdjZiNm5LM21hcGdvcVNjNUEzU1hNTkFDUXNyQzF2Mzg3TGxlSHc3bHh0TnUzYjZ2S05yTFl6Sk5hLTVLOXlScGlONXR0d1R2ZWgwOU5tMzFycGRyWHlLWDFaSkVGWWhHSk1EZ2NYYzRfUWxQbnNoN0RNTUR3V0xLMXJ1RHg5aFB2NTR1NWk1SDNMcGJ30gGfAUFVX3lxTE5yTHhRYU5LRlAxdzZsWE5nZXdwSXk4bzJQTWNTU1dUNDZOTzJPQmw4MG9jdmgtOXlHeDB0ZmdUX3lYdlRNTlcxT2xiUHo0eU9RY1Y2UVg4bU1mX0ZtWWpnbWpXSE5veVl2bkd1dVNVRzd1czFYalVVOWRlZE1BcHVGemozRFJVbkZjQ0QyOXpJckRwUGJ6MF9hbDhXeTJqTQ</guid></item><item><title>防晒运动及其主张的须知事项--《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPd3NNMWpZdko1d2xnenRFQTc2VVJaa3huODd3VUJIdmdCUUQwa1l1UjBuM2RvWGtlaGZra040aDlwNTdWZmtBTlZneU05OFlzRHhseU90dU9HRm5FSkgwenZpV2NRVkJyV05Ta2F6RXk0MWYyUllUQzAwNll0MHc0Q3h0WUYzQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XBPVO6IAYNC75HSBTFTJGR6AGI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In one TikTok video, a woman declared that she stopped using sunscreen altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2AXN2W22YFCINMAVN4X5IBC2KQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In an Instagram reel, a man insists that building sun exposure without sunscreen can help boost a person’s immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TKEZFIPYSJC7RFTBMLOFZHSQSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And on YouTube, some are promoting do-it-yourself sunscreen alternatives using oil, butters or other natural remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QC5S5XU4MZCZNA3Y7D75XYP6VE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For years dermatologists and health experts have extolled the value of sunscreen to prevent skin cancer and protect people from the ultraviolet radiation of the sun.

According &lt;a href="https://periodic-table.rsc.org/element/35/bromine" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;to the Royal Society of Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, the discovery of the element bromine by French chemist Antoine-Jérôme Balard in 1826 led to something of a bromide craze once doctors learned of its powerful anticonvulsant and sedative properties — the same use cases that veterinarians sometimes cite when prescribing it to epileptic dogs today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as these "bromide salts" became a popular treatment for headaches, tummy aches, and general malaise in the late 1800s and early 1900s, the drugs themselves would often build up in the bloodstream of users, leading to bromide toxicity or bromism. Described as a &lt;a href="https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Neurology/Bromism/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;neuropsychiatric disorder&lt;/a&gt; due to its laundry list of symptoms, overdosing on bromide can lead to everything from confusion and slurred speech to hallucinations, psychosis, and even coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it was estimated around the turn of the 20th century that some &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/570345" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;eight percent of psychiatric hospital admissions&lt;/a&gt; were due to bromism, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2387035/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;those numbers fell sharply&lt;/a&gt; after bromides &lt;a href="https://www3.epa.gov/pesticides/chem_search/reg_actions/reregistration/fs_G-48_1-Sep-93.pdf" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;became regulated&lt;/a&gt; by the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1970s — though as this case shows, it can obviously still happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to replicate the man's conversations, &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/guy-gives-himself-19th-century-psychiatric-illness-after-consulting-with-chatgpt/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;404 Media&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; when asking ChatGPT various queries about sodium chloride and sodium bromide that the chatbot readily recommended the dangerous compound. When asked, for instance, "what can chloride be replaced with?" ChatGPT responded that "you can often substitute it with other halide ions such as: Sodium Bromide (NaBr): Replacing chloride with bromide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the chatbot did follow up to ask for further context, it never warned against using sodium bromide — and also appeared not to know that the primary reason people use sodium chloride is for table salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the release of the GPT-5 large language model (LLM), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has bragged that this latest model is "&lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/07/openai_gpt_5/" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;the best model ever for health&lt;/a&gt;." Given that the unnamed bromism sufferer used, per his doctors' reckoning in their paper, either ChatGPT-3.5 or ChatGPT-4, we certainly hope that's true — if only for the sake of those less AI-literate among us, who seem to trust what these chatbots without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on ChatGPT and health:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/openai-admits-chatgpt-missed-delusions" class="underline hover:text-futurism hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OpenAI Admits ChatGPT Missed Signs of Delusions in Users Struggling With Mental Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 11:30:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE5TSlVENWNYQUZTNlJSQkVIRWF1OHhtbk9uVzlicjVybXo1UWpiMllncEE5OGgwckhKU1UyV1M1b2ZUeUpNRHFhdk4yRGpUTWNkbjFYRG9qZnZEYW81</guid></item><item><title>我们所知道的关于基孔肯雅病毒的一切，因为中国在基孔肯雅病毒传播到其他国家后将患者锁定- LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOTnJ1cmkycEM0R3EyQmdhaTNzWUM4a3BsR0tvVmVXaVNBTF9VbnMxZ2dYYkh1UXM4QUxsM1NvWkdTWW9xVFAzR2ZpMUdNTjV5VEZwVVZMdFAycUFJYm9iSWZ0dEgwVmhFdkJvdDFISWRxUmgtdHc2SHU5djB4SzQyaXh6c24tQzR3cURFd1VYdWx0UlRXZmJBMlJxX1czYjdPaVB6VQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is spreading like wildfire across Chinese cities, with health organisations reporting people in Europe, Africa, the Americas and other parts of Asia also coming down with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While definitely not as fatal as &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/coronavirus"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, CHIKV is &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/chinkungunya-virus-china-spread-symptoms-615841-20250805"&gt;affecting millions of people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, causing the implementation of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/stay-home-warning-virus-bug-norovirus-48-hours-748483-20241129"&gt;home-based quarantines&lt;/a&gt; and drones being driven into highly populated areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;China is currently pulling out all the stops when it comes to trying to contain the virus and stop the number of infections from rising, but cases have now been reported in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If this is your first time hearing about the illness, or you want to know more about how it spreads and which countries the virus has been detected in, we’ve detailed everything you need to know about the Chikungunya &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The Chinese government has implemented measures to eradicate the disease (VCG/VCG via Getty Images)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Chikungunya virus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Chikungunya virus causes the viral Chikungunya disease - a significant concern for &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/travel"&gt;travellers&lt;/a&gt; to some destinations, including &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;First &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/chikungunya-virus-china-who-statement-387257-20250806"&gt;identified during an outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in Tanzania in 1952, Chikungunya remained relatively contained to parts of Africa and Asia for many years, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2025/08/07/what-are-the-symptoms-of-the-chikungunya-virus-and-is-there-a-vaccine/"&gt;as per&lt;/a&gt; the UK government’s blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, the virus has now spread to new territories and is currently affecting thousands of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;More than 7,000 cases have been reported across China's Guangdong province since July, with Foshan city being hit the hardest.

However, nearly half of the adults in the United States still don’t get enough magnesium from diet alone, making magnesium supplementation a tool for filling in the gaps. “That gap becomes even more likely in people who are physically active,” says Dr. Nima Alamdari, PhD, who serves as the Chief Scientific Officer at Ritual. “ Strenuous exercise increases magnesium loss through sweat and urine, which can raise daily requirements by as much as 10 to 20 percent, according to research.” Ahead, we asked top dieticians, nutritionists, and scientists to answer all our burning magnesium questions, including how to pick the best supplements for every concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In This Story:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Overall:&lt;/strong&gt; DaVinci Labs Tri-Mag 300 Chelated Magnesium Supplement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-IJXIe ddXKXd callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hIYvDT cYxZHF product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/4BfJvaXoLe6BJTvQ86TZGMRwFEmPryNHgJPm5DKvrdJpVVAc3nBcCJXgUgavE2d8TZLBRkzRRqxcSmTZGYjj9pkFHV5RAkqqM9NWPzT52XhuSPwZcXUcNUYkRTccw6jsqVMXpTBofpuMaC6rjiDEPnvzeByR6efhLbi5z3KHHFshBvRifCKy2skfAs96715ebABV14mszTiZP8hB92thki1MxsZWKogBnFbh2ASgo6AbgvbQw1wJyYShTYr2sNxidJeXYoi5ksz7b2wuvP5qVzsx5aE","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"DaVinci","dangerousHed":"Labs Tri-Mag 300 -

The blend is measured in micrograms, which means it’s easy to incorporate into your routine at a low and slow dose. Best of all, Juna’s bite-sized gummies are third-party tested, certified organic, and made without added sugar and filler ingredients. Timing can enhance magnesium’s effects, too. “If you’re new to magnesium, start with a low dose and gradually increase as tolerated, " says Fazio. “And look for magnesium supplements that are third‑party tested for quality and purity, and avoid unnecessary fillers, artificial colors, sweeteners, or additives.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Elemental magnesium (with 72 trace minerals)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; Not listed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 gummy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Gummy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Tasting:&lt;/strong&gt; Moon Juice Magnesi-Om&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; This delicious magnesium is perfect to whip up your own sleep girl mocktail. Just add ice, tart cherry juice, and a fizzy mix-in like sparkling water or soda tonic. It has three forms of magnesium plus &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453021001324?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;, a non-protein amino acid from tea leaves said to promote feelings of calmness and relaxation, making it a great option right before bed. “I generally like magnesium dosed in the evening, especially if you are using it for relaxation, stress relief, or sleep support,” says Gerber. This powder dissolves almost instantly, so there’s no chalky aftertaste, and has amazing flavors like blue lemon, berry, and cherry—it tastes so good you’ll actually look forward to taking it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium gluconate, acetyl taurinate, and citrate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 310mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 tsp&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Powder&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Topical:&lt;/strong&gt; Ancient Minerals Magnesium Gel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out, beginners can start their with magnesium supplementation in a topical form. “In my opinion, topical magnesium—usually sulfate or chloride forms—is the best starting off point for anyone new to magnesium supplements, especially those who have been stressed for a long time,” explains Gerber. “It can come in transdermal forms like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-magnesium-sprays" target="_blank"&gt;magnesium gel&lt;/a&gt;, oil, lotion, and even Epsom salts that work for a soothing bath or foot soak with gentle absorption.” With pure magnesium chloride and organic botanicals like aloe vera, this gel smooths onto skin beautifully, absorbs right away, and feels incredible, whether in a tension-relieving massage or post-workout. “Magnesium sulfate and magnesium chloride are great in topicals for muscle relaxation and recovery through absorption via the skin,” says Fazio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium chloride&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 100mg per 1ml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1ml&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Topical

It:&lt;/strong&gt; Pure Encapsulations is a go-to for its clean, non-GMO, and third-party tested formulas that help ensure safety and efficacy in every dose, including its single-ingredient magnesium citrate capsule that helps keep your digestion in check. “Magnsium citrate is an osmotic laxative that helps you poop,” says Gerber. “It gently relieves constipation by drawing water into the stool.” It’s also highly bioavailable, meaning your body can absorb it, and can support the metabolism and breakdown of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fats in the body, ensuring smoother digestion. “Taken before bed, magnesium citrate can promote both relaxation and a morning bowel movement,” Fazio adds.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium citrate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 150mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1

L-Threonate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; You can squeeze this vanilla cream-flavored gel directly into your mouth or mix it with water—either way it tastes good and delivers 94mg of magnesium l-threonate.“I like Magnesium L‑Threonate by Cymbiotika, which is formulated in a liposomal delivery system to enhance absorption and bioavailability,” says Fazio. “This form is designed to cross the blood–brain barrier, supporting cognitive health, memory, and focus, making it an excellent choice for those experiencing mental fatigue or high cognitive demands. Plus, it tastes great, which helps with taking it consistently.” One gel packet per day is all you need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium

Available in three flavors, Be Love’s drink is formulated for optimal absorption, drawing upon 220mg of sodium, 45mg of potassium, and 15mg of magnesium malate (the form known to aid in pain relief and reduced fatigue) to hydrate, energize, and replenish with every sip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type of Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; Magnesium malate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Per Serving:&lt;/strong&gt; 15mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serving Size:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 can&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Form:&lt;/strong&gt; Drink&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything You Need to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hsYVHT jBbAVt"&gt;&lt;div id="worth" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are magnesium supplements worth it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experts agree that magnesium supplementation can absolutely be worth it. “Magnesium is involved in everything from energy to nerve signaling to muscle function and sleep regulation,” explains Fazio. “Unfortunately, modern diets, stress, soil nutrient depletion and certain medications often leave people suboptimal or even deficient.” You should, of course, try to get optimal magnesium through your everyday diet to capture food-based sources of magnesium regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="benefits" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the benefits of magnesium supplements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplementing magnesium can be especially helpful if you struggle with sleep, stress, muscle tension, migraines, or constipation. “Magnesium helps us turn food into energy—it's a cofactor for several key enzymes in the citric acid cycle,” says Gerber. “It helps with muscle contraction and relaxation, pain relief, sleep, stress relief, and also helps us make certain neurotransmitters like serotonin and GABA.” In a clinical setting, Fazio sees magnesium often help individuals experiencing muscle cramps, sleep disturbances, or stress overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is also a key partner in supporting bone, immune, and metabolic health. “Magnesium is required to activate and use &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/vitamin-d-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, too, which can help us better absorb calcium for supporting strong bones,” says Fazio. “That means that without sufficient magnesium, vitamin D supplementation may be less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="types" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium comes in several different forms, each with unique benefits. Here, Fazio breaks down the different types and benefits of each:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Glycinate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is highly bioavailable and gentle on the stomach, making it ideal for stress relief, relaxation, sleep support, and general magnesium repletion. It’s well tolerated, even for those with sensitive digestion, and is less likely to cause changes in bowel habits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Citrate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is well-absorbed and commonly used for occasional constipation as it draws water into the stool. Taken before bed, it can promote both relaxation and a morning bowel movement. If constipation isn’t your main concern, magnesium glycinate is often a better choice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Malate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form supports energy production and muscle recovery, making it a good option for people experiencing fatigue, soreness, or chronic muscle pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium L‑Threonate:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is unique for its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, supporting memory, focus, and overall cognitive health. It’s often chosen for those with high mental demands or for sleep support linked to brain relaxation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium Oxide:&lt;/strong&gt; This form is poorly absorbed, with a strong laxative effect. It’s best reserved for short‑term constipation relief, such as during travel, and should be followed by rehydration and electrolyte support due to fluid losses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium sulfate and magnesium chloride:&lt;/strong&gt; These forms are typically used topically for muscle relaxation and recovery through absorption via the skin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="best" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the best form of magnesium to take?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best form of magnesium ultimately depends on your goals. Overall, for those looking for a versatile, well-tolerated option, Gerber, Fazio, and Alamdari all agree that magnesium glycinate is the top daily choice. “For sleep and nervous system support, magnesium glycinate or magnesium L‑threonate are excellent options and pairs well with an evening wind-down routine to enhance relaxation and sleep quality,” says Fazio. “Magnesium L‑threonate also stands out for cognitive function and focus, because it can cross the blood-brain barrier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to occasional constipation, Fazio notes that magnesium citrate or magnesium oxide are both options. “Magnesium citrate is often the most effective choice for occasional constipation,” she says. “Magnesium oxide can be used short‑term for travel-related constipation, but it’s harsh on the digestive system and not recommended for regular use.” She recommends taking it one to two hours before bedtime, noting if you’re using it for constipation relief, bedtime dosing is often “more effective since it may take several hours to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerber recommends magnesium malate or topical magnesium for muscle recovery or soreness, noting it’s better suited for daytime use. “Magnesium malate is best for overall energy production and muscle function,” she says. “Topical magnesium—like sulfate or chloride—can be used in a massage or bath soak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="consider" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-ioTxOM fhuYhW"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to Consider When Taking Magnesium Supplements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, magnesium supplements are widely considered safe and well-tolerated when used as directed. Typically magnesium can be taken at any time of day but a lot of experts find it’s helpful in the evening to support muscle relaxation and better sleep. The key is consistency, taking it daily, at a time that fits your routine. “Some forms of magnesium are better tolerated with food,” says Alamdari. “But magnesium bisglycinate is gentle enough to take on an empty stomach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that magnesium can interfere with the absorption of other minerals. “It can affect absorption of calcium, zinc, and iron if taken together in high doses,” says Fazio. “It may also interact with certain prescription medications, including some antibiotics, diuretics, thyroid medications, and blood pressure medications, so be sure to space magnesium at least two hours apart from iron, calcium, high-dose zinc, or thyroid medications to avoid absorption issues.” Of course, if you’re taking prescription medications or have any underlying health issues, always check with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people report feeling “wired” or restless after taking magnesium. “This can happen when electrolyte balance—particularly sodium or potassium levels—is off,” says Fazio. “Magnesium works closely with these other electrolytes to regulate nerve signaling and muscle function, so an imbalance may change how magnesium feels in the body.” Gerber notes that taking too much magnesium can cause further sodium depletion and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-electrolyte-drink" target="_blank"&gt;electrolyte&lt;/a&gt; imbalances if someone is struggling with lower cellular sodium levels. “It is common in states of high chronic stress and can be tested using something called HTMA testing for intracellular mineral status,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="meet" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eWlGuu eNwKZf"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-foSklP hYGjBC"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-ywYcO eQgPvY"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-lbLhfD ButtonWrapper-igqDZ etNHkr cxIcZU button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eSsfaw Wvvyo" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cyWivE hvohFn button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-bPelIb kkMxiD opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://ritual.com/articles/the-science-behind-essential-protein" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://ritual.com/articles/the-science-behind-essential-protein"}' href="https://ritual.com/articles/the-science-behind-essential-protein" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nima Alamdari&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is a Harvard-trained muscle physiologist specializing in health and sports science.

            In a large and hastily arranged Zoom call on Saturday, about 800 rattled staffers with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tried to make sense of the trauma they endured just a day earlier when a gunman opened fire on the agency’s buildings from across the street.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4leg4x00003b6nbbjqz0ps@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They had been winding down for the weekend when more than 40 bullets smashed through their office windows, whizzing just over their cubicle walls and petrifying staffers in at least four buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4qeu7r00003b6nprcbwhys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But Friday’s violent episode is the latest unsettling new chapter to what has been a turbulent period for the CDC. While authorities have not announced a motive for the shooting, law enforcement sources say the suspect may have targeted the CDC over health concerns he blamed on the Covid-19 vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4r28r600023b6n4ugddhxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the world’s leading health agencies, the CDC is tasked with protecting the health of Americans. But it has come under fire during the second Trump administration as conspiracy theories continue to plague the vaccine credited with halting the spread of the global pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4r2vjz00063b6nvrslfnlf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The attack on the CDC offices had been targeted and deliberate, CDC leaders told staff on the call. Staffers might hear their work was targeted as a possible motivation for the shooter, leadership added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4m9hjn000h3b6n5n81ulpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry acknowledged the terror staffers experienced whether they were in the building or not, saying leaders were “mad this happened.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4mboqv000k3b6nf7yspcgp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Leaders told staffers, many of whom work in the agency’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, the attack was carried out by a shooter who had been reaching out for mental health assistance for weeks before the incident but had not made any threats ahead of time, according to two sources who spoke on the condition they not be named.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4mgb3y000r3b6n72klw4e1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s unclear who the suspect, identified as 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White, was reaching out to. The investigation into what led to the shooting is ongoing.

            The shooting began just before 5 p.m. at the Emory Point CVS drugstore on Clifton Road, directly across from the main entrance to the CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4ok6k700303b6nbk58jyl1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The gunman – wearing what appeared to be a surgical mask and armed with two handguns, a rifle, a shotgun and two backpacks filled with ammo – fired on &lt;a href="https://x.com/cdcmonarez/status/1953989005122441401?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;at least four&lt;/a&gt; CDC buildings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There were at least 40 bullet&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;holes in two buildings, as well as a few in a third building, CDC leaders said on the call Saturday. The buildings house much of the non-lab work at CDC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rm2kd001f3b6n47wjqj5x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This was not stray bullets,” one leader said on the call, sharing updates from the authorities. CNN obtained copies of staff notes from the meeting, which were shared in a large employee group chat.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4s26xp001p3b6n0agcrch3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            CDC employees said on Saturday’s call they felt like “sitting ducks.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rcdi8000o3b6nz9uvpwog@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Photos viewed by CNN taken from inside one CDC building depict bullet holes in windows and shattered glass on the floor. The images show rounds of ammunition flew just above a line of office cubicles where employees sit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rlusp00183b6nupi0asu5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As the gunman fired at the CDC complex, DeKalb County police officer David Rose pulled up. The shooter turned his aim from the CDC complex to the officer, according to a law enforcement source.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4rm2xi001h3b6nxw2vao8j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rose, 33, was shot and later died at a hospital. A married father of two, with another on the way, Rose would have made one year on the job next month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            After a tense lockdown stretching into the night, the gunman was struck by gunfire and found dead on the second floor of the CVS store. Police could not say if the gunfire came from officers or the gunman himself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4oxe24003d3b6nrfqyj3ne@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the CDC offices, employees said the situation could have been much worse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4p0bcp003n3b6nn6fd6flg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a miracle no one was killed here,” one CDC employee told CNN.

            After speaking with family members of the suspect, police are operating under the hypothesis he was either sick or believed he was sick and blamed the illness on the Covid-19 vaccine, a law enforcement official told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The shooting occurred the same week US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – a longtime critic of Covid vaccinations, with a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/21/politics/fact-check-rfk-not-anti-vax/index.html"&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; of spreading vaccine misinformation – &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-winds-down-mrna-development-under-barda.html" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the cancellation of a half-billion dollars in investments in mRNA projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nbddv001g3b6nm28m96zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS said it would cancel federal funding for nearly two dozen mRNA vaccine projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4p4n2i003y3b6nfjb4g4j4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at CDC’s Atlanta campus that took the life of officer David Rose,” Kennedy &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1954197860754350238" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Saturday. “No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4p4er5003t3b6n27cune6g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Public health workers show up every day with purpose — even in moments of grief and uncertainty,” the health secretary continued. “We honor their service. We stand with them. And we remain united in our mission to protect and improve the health of every American.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4ncog6001j3b6na46k5k6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked on the Saturday call if she had spoken to Kennedy about his plan to address the shooting, CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez responded they’ve been in contact with his office, according to staff notes obtained by CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nk8p2001u3b6nuv5qt80p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Monarez was also asked what the agency planned to do to address disinformation, but agency leaders on the call did not directly respond.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nk6sn001r3b6ns3yd6axd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Monarez informed CDC staff via email they will work remotely on Monday while a “security assessment” is conducted. Employee assistance personnel were made available to workers, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4o42f0002o3b6nq7sqqr07@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said CDC employees have “had a tough go of it in the past year,” referencing the “uncertainty” around CDC staff’s employment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nuza500203b6n36hi08tb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The agency has lost nearly a quarter of its staff since January. The Trump administration’s proposed budget for the fiscal year 2026 would slash the agency’s funding by more than half.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nwmze00233b6nm9mxlod7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Under the proposed reorganization, the CDC would lose additional programs. Some would be transferred to a new Administration for a Healthy America, while others - such as the National Center for Chronic Disease and Health Promotion - would be eliminated entirely.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cme4nxgko00293b6n7ghs897z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My heart goes out to you,” Dickens said. “We are with you. We stand with you, and we’re doing everything we can to make sure that we bring resolve to the situation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

While the well-known proverb claims that “an apple a day keeps the doctor away,” experts suggest that doubling this habit could bring even greater benefits. Gastroenterologist Dr. Joseph Salhab recently highlighted how eating two apples daily can help reduce the risk of fatty liver disease, protect against colon cancer, improve heart health, regulate blood sugar levels, and even support weight management. Apples are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and essential nutrients, making them a simple yet effective addition to a healthy lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While apples are not a miracle cure, eating two apples daily is a simple, sustainable habit with far-reaching health benefits. From improving liver and colon health to supporting cardiovascular wellness, regulating blood sugar, and aiding weight management, apples prove that sometimes the simplest dietary changes can have the biggest impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How two apples a day can make a significant difference to your well-being&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apples are an impressive combination of soluble and insoluble fibre, vitamin C, potassium, and powerful antioxidants such as quercetin and polyphenols. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fibre, known as pectin, plays a critical role in cholesterol reduction, blood sugar control, and digestive health by nourishing beneficial gut bacteria and improving nutrient absorption. The antioxidants protect cells from oxidative damage, which is one of the main contributors to chronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Eating two apples daily increases the intake of these beneficial compounds, creating a steady, natural supply of nutrients that work in harmony to maintain metabolic balance and strengthen immunity. Regular apple consumption also supports weight management, reduces inflammation, promotes healthy skin, and enhances overall cardiovascular and cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supporting liver function and reducing fatty liver risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease is an increasingly common health issue, particularly linked to high-fat diets, sedentary lifestyles, and metabolic disorders. Apples can aid in preventing and managing this condition because their soluble fibre binds with cholesterol and fat, limiting their absorption in the digestive tract. The liver is spared from storing excess fat, reducing the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Additionally, the polyphenols in apples reduce oxidative stress and inflammation—two key processes that lead to liver cell damage. By consuming two apples daily, these protective benefits are amplified, providing an extra layer of defense for long-term liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Colon health and cancer prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer is one of the most common types of cancer globally, often linked to a diet low in fibre and antioxidants. Apples address this risk on two fronts: improved bowel regularity and antioxidant protection. The pectin fibre in apples acts like a natural cleansing agent for the colon, preventing constipation and reducing the time harmful substances spend in the digestive tract. Meanwhile, antioxidants neutralize free radicals that could damage colon cells and trigger cancerous changes. Research suggests that people who regularly consume apples have a lower risk of developing colon cancer, and eating two apples daily may strengthen this natural defense even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Heart health and cholesterol balance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol management is another area where apples excel. The pectin in apples binds to cholesterol molecules in the digestive system and removes them from the body, lowering levels of LDL cholesterol—the so-called “bad cholesterol.” This contributes to cleaner arteries, better blood flow, and a reduced risk of plaque buildup, which is associated with heart disease. The antioxidants in apples also prevent oxidative damage to arterial walls, reducing inflammation and maintaining healthy blood vessels. Eating two apples every day supports healthier cholesterol levels and offers long-term cardiovascular protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regulating blood sugar and reducing diabetes risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though apples have a naturally sweet taste, their fibre content slows sugar absorption into the bloodstream. This prevents sudden spikes in blood sugar, making apples a smart choice for people trying to manage or prevent type 2 diabetes. Polyphenols in apples further improve insulin sensitivity, helping the body use glucose more efficiently. Eating two apples daily ensures steady energy levels, a reduced risk of insulin resistance, and better overall blood sugar stability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight management and digestive health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two apples a day can also assist with natural weight management. Their high water and fibre content create a sense of fullness, reducing the urge to snack on processed or high-calorie foods. Over time, this can lead to improved calorie control and healthy weight loss. Additionally, the fibre in apples acts as a prebiotic, feeding beneficial gut bacteria that improve digestion, immunity, and even mental health. A balanced gut microbiome supported by regular apple consumption enhances nutrient absorption and overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt; Consult a healthcare provider before making significant changes to your diet or health routine, especially if you have existing medical conditions or allergies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-a-suspected-flu-led-to-a-brain-tumour-diagnosis-for-a-26-year-old-man-dont-ignore-headaches-fatigue-and-other-warning-signs/articleshow/123134962.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;How a suspected flu led to a brain tumour diagnosis for a 26-year-old: Don’t ignore headaches, fatigue and other warning signs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>骨盆底物理治疗师说，这是每个人（包括男性）都应该做的三项运动- Fit&amp;Well</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7gFBVV95cUxNaWg2ZWlRSHNpNFh0MjhhcjFheVNVbHdLdlNNWlctNGlxa1BMaFZUSEdic2lCOU05b0ZpTG9IMGMyWDJnT3B6Yi1hMVVmTkZlUUFfSXk5a0tSbUprbkh5cW1ySUhNUWVFUnAwbkRhUmtoRHd4dzhGR1ZMSTJDbmpxdmIwQjJSYnpfZzBLWDZranc3UFpIMXBPSzRiQ1l2cUdfdDNTZ1Z4Qzc0N3Uzek9wUTcydDhiS1FZWkp4RFFWd1AxZW9vNXNEaVVFdkNDUVZuNS1EWDdjSE4tRUM3dW84RDY5c1hqZXl4V2ZIQ2hB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="article__body "&gt;
&lt;p id="b8346db7-cf2f-4462-9452-775cdd313d1d"&gt;Pelvic floor issues can have a big impact on your quality of life, particularly if you're dealing with incontinence or experiencing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, over 25 million adult Americans experience temporary or chronic incontinence, according to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/what-to-know-about-urinary-incontinence-in-women/" target="_blank" data-url="https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/what-to-know-about-urinary-incontinence-in-women/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;National Association for Continence&lt;/a&gt;, but there are exercises you can do to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b8346db7-cf2f-4462-9452-775cdd313d1d-2"&gt;"We should all be strengthening our pelvic floor in the same way that we should all be physically active," says pelvic floor physical therapist at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ten.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ten.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Ten Health&lt;/a&gt;, Leanne O'Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You want to aim for prevention, as opposed to being reactive when the problem already exists," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that menopausal and postmenopausal women are more prone to incontinence, O'Brien says that strengthening the pelvic floor is particularly important for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, incontinence can still be an issue for men, especially later in life, so there are benefits to strengthening your pelvic floor whatever your sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-do-you-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-do-you-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do you strengthen the pelvic floor?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="afb5beeb-b8da-4874-8770-192e2a8d9f29"&gt;There are specific ways to strengthen the floor, like the Kegel exercises that O'Brien has shared below, but it's also important to strengthen supporting muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VrX3XPvG3vBsUCWvjucfRW" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VrX3XPvG3vBsUCWvjucfRW slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pelvic floor works with other muscles around the pelvis," O'Brien explains. "If you have weakness through the gluteal muscles or abdominal muscles, it means that the pelvic floor has to work harder."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've had patients who have had surgery, who have been told they have to do pelvic floor exercises. They have an incredibly strong pelvic floor, but actually they've not done any strength training," she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that even though their pelvic floor is strong, it's having to work extremely hard to support the glutes and abs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do glute and core exercises correctly, you actually recruit the pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're engaging the abdominal muscles and you're doing an abdominal or a core-based exercise, you'll also be working on the pelvic floor," confirms O'Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends strength training twice a week or three times a week if you have symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-three-moves-to-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-three-moves-to-strengthen-the-pelvic-floor"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three moves to strengthen the pelvic floor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="acc695da-f06e-4689-aeb4-e3af2068d9a6"&gt;O'Brien has shared three exercises that target the pelvic floor, glutes and core, all of which will help you strengthen the pelvic floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should never be symptomatic during the exercise, so you shouldn't have any leaking or any urgency when you're doing the exercise, because that suggests you're over challenging the pelvic floor," O'Brien says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1-squeeze-and-lift" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-squeeze-and-lift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

"Squeeze the rectum and try to lift the rectum internally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squeeze for 10 seconds, then release for five seconds 10 times in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more tips on how to effectively do pelvic floor squeezes, read our &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/a-pelvic-floor-expert-says-70-percent-of-her-patients-do-squeezes-incorrectly-these-are-her-tips-on-getting-the-most-out-of-kegels" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/a-pelvic-floor-expert-says-70-percent-of-her-patients-do-squeezes-incorrectly-these-are-her-tips-on-getting-the-most-out-of-kegels"&gt;full guide to pelvic floor kegels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2-squat" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-squat"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

							&lt;p&gt;You know those people who make you do a double-take when you find out their real age? The ones who look 40 when they're pushing 60, or seem frozen at 50 while celebrating their 70th birthday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've all met them. And while we might assume they hit the genetic lottery, the truth is more encouraging than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While genetics do play a role in how we age, our daily habits have an enormous impact on whether we look and feel younger than our chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These aren't expensive treatments, invasive procedures, or extreme lifestyle overhauls we're talking about. Instead, they're consistent, often simple choices that compound over time. Small decisions made day after day that either accelerate or decelerate the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part? It's never too late to start incorporating these habits. Whether you're 25 or 65, your body responds to positive changes faster than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly are these age-defying habits?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They prioritize quality sleep every single night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever notice how a bad night's sleep makes you look like you've aged five years overnight?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's actual science behind this. As Matthew Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at &lt;em&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9059444-sleep-is-the-single-most-effective-thing-we-can-do"&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;: "Sleep is the single most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who look decades younger treat sleep like a non-negotiable appointment with themselves. They're not scrolling their phones until midnight or binge-watching shows until 2 AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, they've figured out their optimal sleep schedule and stick to it religiously. Seven to nine hours isn't just a suggestion for them—it's a non-negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They avoid smoking like their youth depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's something that might sound obvious, but it's worth spelling out: smoking is basically a time machine that fast-forwards your appearance by decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted by the folks at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/smoking-cessation/ss/slideshow-ways-smoking-affects-looks"&gt;WebMD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; "Smoking changes the skin, teeth, and hair in ways that can add years to your looks". And we're not just talking about a subtle difference here—we're talking about dramatic, visible aging that's often irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen before-and-after photos of identical twins where one smoked and the other didn't. The difference after just a few years is striking—deeper wrinkles, duller skin, yellowed teeth, and an overall aged appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news? Your body starts repairing itself almost immediately after you quit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They move their bodies with purpose and intensity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to know a secret that sounds too good to be true? Exercise might literally slow the clock on your cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://universe.byu.edu/2017/06/28/byu-research-suggests-exercise-reverses-cellular-aging-process1/"&gt;Research by professor Larry Tucker&lt;/a&gt; suggests that individuals who consistently engage in vigorous exercise can have cells that are as much as nine years younger than those of people who lead sedentary lives. Nine years! Let that sink in for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense to me. The people I know who look decades younger have made physical activity a non-negotiable part of their routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn't mean they're all marathon runners or gym rats. But they do something that gets their heart pumping and their body working hard on a regular basis. Maybe it's cycling, swimming, dancing, or hitting the weights—the key is consistency and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They protect their skin from sun damage religiously&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a question: what's the single biggest factor that makes someone look older than their years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you guessed sun damage, you're spot on. As &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047276/"&gt;noted by experts&lt;/a&gt;, "exposure to UV radiation is the primary factor of extrinsic skin aging; it accounts for about 80% of facial aging."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this lesson the hard way after years of California beach days without proper protection. The difference between the covered and uncovered parts of my body tells the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look remarkably young treat sunscreen like brushing their teeth—it's just part of their daily routine. They understand that a few extra minutes of protection now saves them decades of visible aging later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's probably the simplest anti-aging strategy that exists, yet so many people skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They manage stress before it manages them&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, people who look decades younger have mastered the art of not letting life's inevitable stresses show up on their face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they meditate, maybe they journal, maybe they have weekly therapy sessions, or maybe they've just learned to let things go faster than most of us. The method matters less than the consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not talking about people who never experience stress—that's impossible. I'm talking about people who've learned to move through stress rather than marinate in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They understand that holding onto tension, worry, and frustration doesn't just feel bad—it looks bad too. So they've prioritized finding ways to release it regularly rather than carrying it around like invisible baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing about looking decades younger than your actual age: it's not about finding the fountain of youth or having perfect genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's about making choices today that your future self will thank you for tomorrow. Every night of quality sleep, every workout, every day you protect your skin—these small decisions compound into something remarkable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who look 40 at 60 didn't stumble into it accidentally. They built these habits deliberately, often starting years before they could see the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's what gives me hope: your body is constantly regenerating itself. The choices you make today start showing up faster than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So which of these habits resonates most with you? Which one feels like the easiest place to start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one habit, make it stick, then add another. Your future self is counting on the decisions you make right now.&lt;/p&gt;

What makes this cancer particularly dangerous is that the symptoms don’t appear in early stages, which delays diagnosis and drastically reduces treatment outcomes. Experts now think that common growth can significantly increase the risk of bowel cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study conducted by the researchers at Flinders University and Flinders Medical Centre has found a critical link between having two types of polyps, common growths found in the bowel, and an increased risk of developing cancer. The findings of the study are published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(25)00635-4/abstract" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (CGH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;No more guesswork: Doctor busts common myths about women’s health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Bowel cancer and common growths &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the bowel cancers begin as benign polys, which are non-threatening growths that appear on the wall or the lining of the bowel. There are two types of polyps - adenomas and serrated polyps, which can then progress into cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you believe is the main factor contributing to bowel cancer risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand if these common growths could increase cancer risk, the researchers analyzed over 8,400 colonoscopy records. They found that people with both adenomas and serrated polyps were up to five times more likely to develop advanced pre-cancerous changes than those with just one type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polyps are common and usually harmless, but when both types appear together—what we call synchronous lesions—the risk of serious bowel disease or cancer rises sharply,” Dr Molla Wassie, lead author and researcher at the FHMRI Bowel Health Service, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more concerning is that nearly half of all the patients with serrated polyps also had adenomas, which hints that the high-risk group is more common than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is one of the largest studies of its kind. Our findings support growing international evidence that these two types of polyps may represent separate cancer pathways that can be active at the same time, making early detection and regular monitoring even more important,” Dr. Wassie said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also see: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/five-common-signs-of-colon-cancer-that-are-often-ignored/photostory/123087531.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Colon Cancer Symptoms: Five common signs of colon cancer that are often ignored&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also noticed that serrated polyps may progress to cancer faster than adenomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Polyps become more common as we age, but the key is catching and removing them early. If you’ve had both types of polyps, it’s especially important to stay on top of your colonoscopy schedule. If you’re over 45 or have a family history of bowel issues, talk to your GP or visit the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program to learn more,” Dr Wassie added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What are the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;symptoms of bowel cancer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though bowel cancer does not have symptoms in the early stages, regular screening can help catch the disease early.

The other group was given the same unit with the filter removed, leaving it unable to properly purify the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a month, the groups swapped purifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using an air purifier at home may reduce the risk of heart attacks, researchers suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood pressure measurements and questionnaires were carried out at the start and end of each period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who started the study with elevated blood pressure saw it reduce during the time using the HEPA filter, while those given the sham unit saw their blood pressure increase in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This research adds to growing evidence that simple interventions, like in-home air filtration, may help improve heart health for people at risk,’ said Dr Douglas Brugge, chair of the Department of Public Health Sciences at the University of Connecticut and lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation, 96 per cent of people in England are exposed to air pollution levels that exceed the limits set out by the World Health Organisation, while those living in deprived areas are at a significantly greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

She became addicted to the devices when she used them to quit smoking cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother-of-five knew the vapes weren't the best for her lungs, but she kept puffing, believing they were a better option than her previous vice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In July, however, she woke up in the middle of the night with 'sharp pains' in her chest, gasping for air as she struggled to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was terrified at the pain and I felt like I was going to die as I was scared I was going to not be able to breathe at all,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eyes rushed to the emergency department, where scans quickly revealed she had&lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14615005/Rapid-rise-vaping-Britain-appears-stalled-users-anticipate-Government-crackdown.html"&gt; bronchiolitis obliterans, better known as 'popcorn lung'.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The condition is a rare type of lung disease, triggered by inflammation in bronchioles, the smallest airways in the lungs, which become scarred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also found an oily substance building up in Eyes' lungs, which they said was the fluid she had breathed in from puffing on her vape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cloey Eyes (pictured), 25, from Florida, said she used vapes constantly in the lead-up to her hospitalization&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I woke up at 2:30am in the morning and my chest felt like it was having a heart attack,' Eyes said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had really bad pains in my chest and had to lean over. I couldn't catch my breath and I had to hit myself in the chest multiple times to be able to catch my breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a sharp pain in my chest, but it also was a suffocating feeling.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said scans initially detected an 'oil pocket' in her left lung, before the same was also found in her right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors found that both lungs also had vape oil around them, though they weren't able to tell how much had collected in her body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was scary to hear this,' she said. 'It's the oil from the vape and this is thickening up as you [breathe it in] and attaching itself to your lungs'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare instances, vapes have been linked to lipoid pneumonia, a condition where oily substances inhaled while puffing on e-cigarettes build up in the lungs causing inflammation and damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients normally suffer from a chronic cough, shortness of breath and coughing up blood or blood-tinged mucus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physicians say there is no good treatment for the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of bronchiolitis obliterans, steroids and an inhaler can reduce inflammation and help with breathing - in severe cases, a lung transplant may be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with the condition require life-long care to manage their symptoms and are advised to avoid air pollution, cigarette smoke, and people who are ill and could pass on infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eyes is pictured above in the hospital while she received treatment for popcorn lung and fluid build up in the organs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'There isn't a good treatment for lipoid pneumonia, other than supportive care, while the lungs heal on their own,' Dr &lt;span&gt;Stephen Broderick, a lung cancer surgeon at Johns Hopkins University, &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/what-does-vaping-do-to-your-lungs#:~:text=Vaping%2DRelated%20Lipoid%20Pneumonia,Symptoms%20of%20lipoid%20pneumonia%20include:"&gt;previously&lt;/a&gt; said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The single most important thing you can do is identify what is causing it - in this case vaping - and eliminate it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eyes revealed she would use rechargeable disposable vapes, throwing them away when they 'ran out of juice'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She would puff on the device more than 300 times a day, and get through a 5,000-puff device every two weeks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although she would pick a different flavor every time, she said she would always opt for fruity varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She started smoking cigarettes in 2020 shortly before the Covid pandemic, but quit in August 2023 because she 'hated the smell'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;That's when she started using vapes instead.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I used the vape more than when I smoked as it was handy and right there,' she said of her addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When I was smoking, the pack [20 cigarettes] would last me four days, so I would smoke around five cigarettes a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew vaping wasn't any better than smoking, I just hated the smell of the smoke [from cigarettes] and needed to stop.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eyes' condition was severe, and she had to stay overnight at the hospital before she was prescribed antibiotics, an inhaler and cough suppressant medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The mom claimed doctors said it would take her lungs at least a year to heal completely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Popcorn lung&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is linked to diacetyl, a chemical compound found in some vapes and used to make different flavors for the devices. This is breathed in and causes inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Warning signs of the condition include coughing, shortness of breath, wheezing, tiredness and night sweats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eyes (pictured) says she has now quit vapes, and urges others to do the same&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Several vapers have now come forward to reveal they were diagnosed with popcorn lung after using the devices, although it is not clear how many cases have been linked to the devices nationwide.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In some cases, vapes have also been linked to heart attacks caused by the devices triggering inflammation in the blood and raising blood pressure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eyes has now quit vaping, and says she would 'never pick up a vape again'.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went cold turkey and quit vaping,' she said. 'I feel 10 times better now as I have stopped completely. My lungs feel better and I don't feel out of breath all the time...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would tell people to put the vape down, especially if you're a parent. You don't think it's going to happen to you.

The habit is much more common among those between 21 to 24 years old - 15.5 percent of the age group uses the devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many become addicted and describe using them almost constantly during the day, which may raise the risks of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 04:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>迈克尔道格拉斯癌症诊断： “基本本能”明星认为是什么导致了癌症及其原因-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the ‘Basic Instinct’ star wasn’t immune, as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Hollywood icon &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/michael-douglas" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Michael Douglas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; publicly revealed he was battling stage IV throat cancer. He initially thought stress, years of smoking, and heavy drinking might have played a role. However, as facts emerged, it became clear the cancer was linked to a different culprit altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did Michael Douglas think caused his cancer (and what it really was)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When diagnosed in August 2010, Douglas publicly suggested that long-term alcohol and tobacco use, along with stress, might have contributed to his cancer. He admitted that stress, especially relating to his son’s incarceration at the time, also weighed on his mind. Later, in a candid 2013 interview, the American actor and producer mentioned human papillomavirus (HPV) tied to oral sex as a possible cause. In a quite uncanny manner, parallels were drawn between him starring in films like ‘Basic Instinct’, ‘Fatal Attraction’, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;His initial symptoms, like persistent throat or ear pain, were misdiagnosed as infection, until a physician in Montreal peered deep into his throat and a tumor was spotted at the base of his tongue. A biopsy confirmed stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, an advanced form of oral cancer, prompting immediate treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The real culprit: HPV, not habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, Douglas made headlines when he suggested his cancer was caused by HPV, a sexually transmitted virus, possibly contracted through oral sex. He remarked: “this particular cancer is caused by HPV … which actually comes about from cunnilingus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, his representatives clarified he was speaking broadly about HPV-linked cancers, not necessarily his own case. They added that he did not definitively state that oral sex caused his personal cancer, and emphasized that HPV is a known risk factor for oropharyngeal cancers, but not necessarily the direct cause in every case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is HPV and why does it matter in oral cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV, or Human Papillomavirus, is a common viral infection that can cause various health problems. It is primarily transmitted through sexual contact and affects the skin and mucous membranes, with over 200 identified types. While many HPV infections are harmless and resolve on their own, some types can lead to serious complications like genital warts and certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is categorized into low-risk and high-risk types. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Low-risk HPV:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These types can cause genital warts but are not typically associated with cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High-risk HPV:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These types can lead to various cancers, including cervical, vaginal, penile, anal, and throat cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV is now recognized as a major risk factor for this type of cancer, particularly in the back of the throat, tonsils, and base of the tongue. While HPV infection is common, it usually clears up on its own. However, in some cases, it can persist and lead to the development of cancer years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;HPV-related throat cancers are becoming increasingly common. In fact, HPV now accounts for a majority of oropharyngeal cancer cases, especially among men. These cancers often strike adults who are non-smokers and non-heavy drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is squamous cell carcinoma?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that develops from squamous cells, which are flat, scale-like cells found in the skin and other tissues. It's the second most common type of skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma, and can also occur in other areas like the lungs, head and neck, and cervix. SCC is often caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cells are a type of epithelial cell, meaning they form the lining of surfaces throughout the body, including the skin, respiratory tract, and digestive tract. They are flat and scale-like, resembling fish scales under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While SCC is commonly found on sun-exposed areas of the skin like the face, scalp, and hands, it can also develop in other locations, including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Skin:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the most common site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lungs:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lung cancer can sometimes be of the squamous cell type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Head and neck:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; This includes cancers of the mouth, throat, and voice box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Cervix:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cervical cancer can also be squamous cell carcinoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other locations:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCC can also occur in the nasal cavity, sinuses, and tear ducts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can HPV cause SCC?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) can cause squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Specifically, high-risk HPV types, like HPV-16 and HPV-18, are strongly linked to the development of certain squamous cell carcinomas, particularly in the oropharynx (the middle part of the throat). HPV infection is a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Risk factors&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCC risk factors include excessive sun exposure, fair skin, a history of sunburns, older age, male gender, immunosuppression, and certain genetic syndromes apart from those stemming from HPV. Lifestyle factors like smoking and heavy alcohol consumption also increase the risk. Additionally, chronic wounds, exposure to radiation or arsenic, and a history of other skin cancers can be contributing factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a detailed look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sun exposure is the most significant risk factor, particularly for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).

Regularly using sunscreen with at least SPF 30, seeking shade during peak sun hours, and wearing protective clothing like hats and long sleeves are essential steps. Annual skin exams, especially for those with risk factors like a history of sun exposure or family history of skin cancer, are also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="134"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell skin cancer treatment options include surgery (excision, Mohs surgery), radiation therapy, and topical or systemic medications, depending on the cancer's size, location, and stage. For early-stage, small cancers, less invasive procedures like curettage and electrodesiccation, cryosurgery, or photodynamic therapy might be sufficient. For advanced cases, or when surgery is not an option, radiation therapy or medications like imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil may be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Douglas, the actor underwent aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatments and has been cancer-free since 2011, though he continues with regular check-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="138"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sanjay Dutt on his battle with cancer: 'It all comes down to willpower and keeping the faith'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="140"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="141"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2025 03:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>科学家在观察到几十年未见的北极现象后发出警告： “根本性转变” - yahoo.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxPMjRYdHhJUGZ1QnFoS1NjRTBUTVZ3NnBHaXl0dXBqR3ZwS2tUUEd4Y0dFbmRwWE1rb3g4LXNrQXpuSjVxNk9DNkxjcjlvaTZGbzBDRTJERktNWnlYNllIRFI1V2pwSXhNUmN6NGx0ZDZoUHNOTERscDE5ZWRTLU5xQjd4VC1qbGFNQ19hbElEcHB1Wjl1RS1n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The ice was supposed to be solid. That's what the scientist expected, anyway. Instead, they stepped into water — standing meltwater, in February, in the Arctic. That's not a weird fluke. That's the new normal in Svalbard, and it's happening faster than most of us realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If that sounds far off, it's not. Because what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay there. When ground that's been frozen for thousands of years starts thawing, it throws everything off — weather, wildlife, even your grocery bill. But this problem can end up costing a lot more than pricier avocados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nature &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60926-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that in February, temperatures in Ny‑Ålesund hovered around minus 3.3 degrees Celsius (26.1 degrees Fahrenheit). That's a sharp departure from the usual minus 15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) average for that time of year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On many days, the thermometer crossed above the freezing point. Rain followed. Tundra gave way to puddles. Field teams documented meltwater pooling over glaciers and scooped soil samples from the ground so soft that they didn't need to dig. Just 5 centimeters (2 inches) below the surface, the soil had already thawed. One researcher called it "a melting ice rink" — a warning sign of what they described as "a fundamental shift" in Arctic winters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why it matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That layer of snow? It's supposed to insulate the tundra. But this time, it turned crusty, then icy — hard enough that reindeer couldn't dig for food. As the soil warmed early, microbes woke up and started releasing gases usually locked in by the cold. Some crews found live vegetation in damp moss weeks before winter was even close to over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The disruption didn't stop there. Scientists in Ny‑Ålesund had to reschedule field work on the fly when the frozen ground thawed and then refroze. Buildings around Svalbard shifted as permafrost beneath them weakened. In some parts of the archipelago, heavy, wet snowpacks now threaten avalanches — not just for researchers, but for tourism, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In places like Svalbard, crews aren't waiting. Some are testing reflective coatings to slow the snowmelt. Others are planting sensors in the ground to track freeze-thaw swings before they cause real trouble. A few towns have swapped diesel for solar and batteries — not for climate points, but because it's cheaper and works when storms shut things down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You don't need Arctic weather to make changes.

			&lt;p&gt;Tiny shards of plastic called microplastics &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-could-accumulate-in-our-brains-more-than-in-kidneys-and-livers"&gt;have been detected&lt;/a&gt; accumulating in human brains, but there is not yet enough evidence to say whether this is doing us harm, experts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These mostly invisible pieces of plastic have been found everywhere from the top of mountains to the bottom of oceans, in the air we breathe and the food we eat. They have also been discovered riddled throughout human bodies, inside lungs, hearts, placentas and even crossing the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing ubiquity of microplastics has become a key issue in efforts to hammer out the world's first plastic pollution treaty, with the latest round of UN talks being held in Geneva next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-detected-infiltrating-human-brains-for-the-first-time"&gt;Microplastics Detected Infiltrating Human Brains For The First Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects that microplastics and even smaller nanoplastics have on human health is not yet fully understood, but researchers have been working to find out more in this relatively new field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most prominent study looking at microplastics in brains was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists tested brain tissue from 28 people who died in 2016 and 24 who died last year in the US state of New Mexico, finding that the amount of microplastics in the samples increased over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study made headlines around the world when the lead researcher, US toxicologist Matthew Campen, told the media that they detected the equivalent of a plastic spoon's worth of microplastics in the brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_170290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170290" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642.jpg" alt="microplastic in a metal spoon" class="wp-image-170290 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/spoon_microplastic_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-170290" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Plastic fragments in the environment break up into microscopic particles.

&lt;p&gt;In the span of a couple of months, she broke both hips and fractured her shoulder, confining her to a wheelchair. Immobility and subpar care led to a gruesome pressure wound on her foot that her depleted, 65-pound body could never heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of society insists on keeping a person alive in that condition? In her predementia days, my mom — always quick with a joke or a biting comment — would have said, “Just get a gun and shoot me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mom died last year, the day before Mother’s Day, I cried with both sorrow at her unfair, horrible ending and with relief that it was finally over. Yet, the nagging question remained about my own uncertain future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caring for my parents, I’d become increasingly obsessed with the idea that I was doomed to spend my final years in a dreary care facility surrounded by strangers, just waiting for the end to come. While I realize that having kids does not guarantee that they will someday take care of you, I also know that there is a zero percent chance that your nonexistent offspring will do it. This thought filled me with a crushing sense of fear and foreboding about getting older. That is, until I resolved to plan my own death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea surfaced gradually from some hidden cranny of my subconscious, reminding me of my favorite movie since high school: “Harold and Maude.” In this 1971 dark comedy starring the great Ruth Gordon, a morbid young man falls in love with a free-spirited septuagenarian. In the film’s climax, Maude carries out a long-held plan to end her life on her 80th birthday, on her own unconventional terms. Why shouldn’t I be like Maude? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought my death would have to be a DIY affair. I knew that if I wasn’t going to die from an incurable illness within six months, or if I had dementia, that would disqualify me from the “medical aid in dying” options offered by a growing number of states. Though well intentioned, these programs are so mired in bureaucracy and restrictions that even patients who qualify often die while waiting for approvals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocacy groups like &lt;a href="https://deathwithdignity.org/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7919746" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Death With Dignity&lt;/a&gt; are working to streamline and expand end-of-life options across the country, but the wheels turn slowly. And if you have dementia, like my mom, or just feel like you’ve had a good run after 90 years on the planet? No soup for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining how to bring about a dignified, pain-free ending without medical help was a daunting prospect, so I began workshopping the idea — only half-joking — with friends. Would my college pal, an anesthesiologist, be willing to risk prison time to help me out? What kind of bribe money would I need to convince a veterinarian to do the deed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in the months after my mom’s death, an acquaintance recommended Amy Bloom’s “In Love: A Memoir of Love and Loss,” a heartbreaking book that chronicles the author’s journey to Zurich to witness the assisted death of her husband, who’d been diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

"When in doubt, throw it out," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potent neurotoxin can cause botulism, a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research/rare-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:rare but serious illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;rare but serious illness&lt;/a&gt; that attacks the nerves, leading to muscle paralysis, breathing difficulty, and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home-canned, low-acid foods including green beans, asparagus, corn, meats, garlic and fermented fish are the most risky, Picone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent botulism, the CDC recommends refrigerating or freezing leftovers promptly after cooking, throwing away damaged or bulging cans, and following the USDA's guide to home-canning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Large reef fish like barracudas can contain ciguatoxins that cause ciguatera fish poisoning in humans.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I like eating fish, but I try to avoid eating large tropical reef fish like barracuda, grouper and Amberjack because of a neurotoxin called ciguatoxin," Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciguatoxin is a neurotoxin produced by certain algae in coral reefs as a defense mechanism.

"This doesn't mean you can't eat fish," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just avoid or limit consumption of large predatory fish, avoid eating certain parts, like the liver or roe, and be aware of endemic areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ciguatera is common in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen said he does not eat &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:under-cooked pork,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;under-cooked pork,&lt;/a&gt; especially from unregulated sources, because of the risk of neurocysticercosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Lifestyle Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurocysticercosis occurs after a person swallows pork tapeworm eggs, according to the CDC. The larvae migrate to tissues like the brain and form cysts, which are diagnosed when found in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A little-known fact is that it's actually one of the leading causes of acquired epilepsy worldwide," Chen said of the infection.

"This type of information ... I feel should be jumped on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Vlachos, executive director of the Alzheimer's Disease Resource Center in East Islip, called the finding "an exciting moment in Alzheimer's research."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The recent Harvard study showing lithium orotate reversing Alzheimer’s-like changes in mice is a major breakthrough, offering renewed hope for treatment and even prevention," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vlachos said it was crucial to continue funding research, but also to move such findings into clinical trials. "Discovery is only part of the equation," she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One expert on Long Island cautioned the study was a preliminary finding and people should not go out and start taking lithium pills.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marc Gordon, chief of neurology for Northwell’s Zucker Hillside, North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, said the study was "interesting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I’m concerned that people are going to completely misinterpret it and think that they've got to start popping lithium carbonate and get toxic," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Bruce A. Yankner, a professor of genetics and neurology at Harvard Medical School, found that researchers could reverse Alzheimer's in mice and restore brain functions using small amounts of the compound lithium orotate. The amount given was enough to mimic the metal’s natural level in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study were reported in the scientific journal Nature on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The obvious impact is that because lithium orotate is dirt cheap, hopefully we will get rigorous, randomized trials testing this very, very quickly," Matt Kaeberlein, former director of the Healthy Aging and Longevity Research Institute at the University of Washington, who did not participate in the study, told The Washington Post. "And I would say that it will be an embarrassment to the Alzheimer’s clinical community if that doesn’t happen right away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankner, who is also the co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at Harvard, told The Post: "I do not recommend that people take lithium at this point, because it has not been validated as a treatment in humans. We always have to be cautious because things can change as you go from mice to humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yankner said other labs still needed to validate the findings of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said the fact the study was done with mice "doesn't mean that it can't be ... taken seriously" and possibly applied to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is a form of dementia that affects memory, thinking and behavior. More than 7 million people in the United States over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's, according to the Alzheimer's Association, a Chicago-based nonprofit which predicts that number will rise to almost 13 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there have been some recent breakthroughs in treating Alzheimer's, researchers have not discovered a medication to stop or reverse it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with bipolar disorder are often prescribed lithium, and some previous research has suggested it could help with Alzheimer’s and also serve as an antiaging medication. One 2017 study in Denmark suggested that lithium found in drinking water could be associated with a lower incident of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;p&gt;

The attack left bullet holes in office windows and claimed the life of DeKalb County police officer David Rose. Authorities believe the shooter, Patrick Joseph White, may have been motivated by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/09/us/atlanta-cdc-emory-university-shooting-hnk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;anti-vaccine sentiment&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the CDC for personal health complications allegedly tied to the Covid-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there is still much we do not know, one thing is clear: This tragedy is not an isolated event. It is a dire reflection of ever-escalating threats public health workers face in a climate increasingly shaped by misinformation, politicization, and inflammatory rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Worse still, it took more than 18 hours for Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1954197860754350238" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;issue a public statement&lt;/a&gt; condemning the violent act. In that time, I personally heard directly from CDC employees — already demoralized by DOGE-led budget and staffing cuts — who felt abandoned by the very leadership meant to defend them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leadership in moments of crisis is critical. Kennedy’s delayed and tepid response, coupled with his own record of inflammatory claims, has only deepened the wounds and amplified a dangerous sense of betrayal among America’s frontline public health workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a former U.S. surgeon general, I’ve seen firsthand how trust in public health can unravel. Recently, Kennedy made headlines by announcing the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/07/kennedy-mrna-vaccines-national-security/"&gt;defunding of mRNA vaccine research&lt;/a&gt;, falsely claiming these vaccines are inherently dangerous. Such statements don’t just mislead — they endanger lives. When influential leaders dismiss decades of rigorous scientific work, they &lt;a href="https://x.com/JeromeAdamsMD/status/1953141924161798190" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;erode public confidence&lt;/a&gt; and embolden those primed to view health professionals as enemies rather than protectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC shooting is part of a growing and deeply disturbing trend. In February 2025, a shooting at UPMC Memorial Hospital in York, Pennsylvania, left another police officer dead and injured multiple health care workers. The American Nurses Association &lt;a href="https://www.nursingworld.org/news/news-releases/2025/hospital-shooting-highlights-the-dangers-and-violence-nurses-often-face-at-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that one in four nurses experiences workplace violence — rates that surpass those for law enforcement or correctional officers. In December 2024, UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/12/17/trump-surgeon-general-unitedhealthcare-killing-00194635" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a flood of online vitriol, much of which disturbingly framed the act as justified outrage against the health care system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What ties these events together is not just the violence — but the context that enables it. Repeated rhetoric from influential voices, including Kennedy and his supporters, has portrayed health professionals as corrupt, untrustworthy, or outright malicious. They’ve been labeled “grifters,” “enemies of the people,” and worse.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One particularly telling — and troubling — comment came from Vinay Prasad, a high-level FDA official handpicked by Kennedy. (He recently left his position only to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/09/vinay-prasad-returns-to-the-fda-weeks-after-his-ouster/"&gt;return weeks later&lt;/a&gt;.) After being asked whether Americans should forgive public health figures for their missteps, Prasad &lt;a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/lying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt;: “I don’t believe in forgiveness because in my opinion these pieces of shit are still lying.” This raw, venomous language from a senior public official doesn’t just reflect deep frustration — it helps fuel a culture of dehumanization that may instigate real-world violence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This climate of hostility has been building for years, particularly around vaccines and Covid-19 mitigation measures. A key example is the 2019 measles outbreak in Samoa, where 83 people — most of them children under 5 — died after vaccination rates fell sharply. RFK Jr.’s visit and messaging during that crisis were widely criticized; Samoa’s top health official called his assertions that the deaths weren’t due to measles “a complete lie,” and accused his rhetoric of &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-jr-slammed-samoas-top-health-official-over-measles-remarks-2025549" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fueling further public distrust&lt;/a&gt; in immunization. Health experts confirm his influence worsened a situation already primed for misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When influential figures amplify falsehoods, they legitimize the anger that leads to violence. Public health professionals, from CDC scientists to local health officials, face harassment, threats, and now gunfire for doing their jobs. This is unacceptable, yet the administration has offered a late and lukewarm condemnation of the shooting, and has thus far failed to address the rhetoric fueling it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What can — and must — be done now:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership must speak up. The administration must forcefully and unequivocally condemn rhetoric that vilifies public health professionals. Public trust starts with leaders affirming the value of science-based public health — and the people behind it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Stop scapegoating. Leaders should stop misdirecting public frustration about systemic health challenges toward the individual health professionals trying to solve them. Demonizing doctors, scientists, and public health agencies fuels violence and delays solutions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Protect health care workers. Congress should immediately pass the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2531/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require comprehensive violence prevention plans in health care settings, including better training, incident tracking, and protections for workers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fund solutions, not slogans. In 2024 then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/06/25/gun-violence-public-health-crisis-surgeon-general-declaration/"&gt;declared gun violence a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt;, citing over 48,000 gun-related deaths in 2022. Whether or not one agrees with that classification, the numbers — and now targeted attacks on public health institutions — demand real action. We must fund research and prevention strategies, not just arm more “good guys with guns” or offer thoughts and prayers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health workers are not the enemy. They are our neighbors, our caregivers, our scientists, and our first line of defense in future crises. The CDC shooting should be a wake-up call — not just for policymakers, but for all of us. It’s time to reject the rhetoric that dehumanizes those trying to keep us safe and take real steps to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s honor Officer Rose and every public health worker facing these mounting threats — not just with words, but with action. Before the next tragedy strikes.&lt;/p&gt;

Over the course of a year, patients taking vortioxetine showed larger improvements in measures of memory, attention, and reasoning, as well as a greater reduction in depressive symptoms, than those taking escitalopram, paroxetine, or bupropion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, gradually impairing a person’s ability to carry out daily activities. Alongside cognitive decline, many people with Alzheimer’s also experience neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and apathy. Depression in Alzheimer’s is common and can intensify the difficulties posed by memory loss and disorientation, while also worsening quality of life for both patients and caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high prevalence of depression in Alzheimer’s has led to increased prescribing of antidepressants in this population. Yet research on how these drugs affect cognitive function has been limited and sometimes conflicting. Certain antidepressants may worsen cognition due to side effects on neurotransmitter systems, while others could potentially support brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vortioxetine is of particular interest because, beyond its action on serotonin receptors, it also influences other neurotransmitter systems involved in learning and memory. Previous studies in people with depression and in those with mild cognitive impairment have hinted at cognitive benefits, but few have directly compared vortioxetine to multiple other antidepressants in patients with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this gap, researchers Eduardo Cumbo and Daniela Migliore conducted a 12-month randomized, open-label study at the Neurodegenerative Disorders Unit in Caltanissetta, Italy. The analysis focused on 108 outpatients with mild Alzheimer’s disease and depressive symptoms. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either vortioxetine (n=36) or one of three other antidepressants—escitalopram, paroxetine, or bupropion (n=72 in total)—while continuing standard Alzheimer’s treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. Patients were assessed at the start of the study, after six months, and after twelve months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was measured using several established tests. The Mini-Mental State Examination evaluated overall cognitive ability, including memory, orientation, and language. The Attentive Matrices test measured selective attention, while the Coloured Progressive Matrices assessed nonverbal reasoning and problem-solving. The Digit Span task tested verbal working memory. Depression severity was measured with the Hamilton Depression Scale and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, patients in all groups showed some improvement on cognitive tests, but gains were generally largest and most consistent in the vortioxetine group. On the Mini-Mental State Examination, vortioxetine-treated patients improved by nearly three points, a statistically significant change. They also showed significant gains in selective attention and nonverbal reasoning, while patients on other antidepressants tended to improve less, and in some cases, not significantly. Working memory scores improved slightly in the vortioxetine group but did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing groups directly, vortioxetine outperformed the other antidepressants on most cognitive measures. The difference was particularly notable when compared to paroxetine, which has anticholinergic properties that can impair cognition in older adults. Escitalopram and bupropion showed moderate improvements on some attention measures, but not to the same extent as vortioxetine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that depressive symptoms decreased in all groups over the 12-month period, but the reduction was more pronounced in patients taking vortioxetine. On both depression scales, the vortioxetine group’s scores dropped by about seven points from baseline—an improvement considered clinically meaningful. Between-group comparisons showed that vortioxetine’s effect on depressive symptoms was statistically superior to that of the other antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were relatively uncommon and generally mild. Nausea and headache were the most frequently reported with vortioxetine, occurring in about 8% of patients. Two participants—one on paroxetine and one on bupropion—discontinued treatment due to side effects. No serious adverse events or deaths occurred during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note some limitations. The trial was conducted at a single site with a modest sample size, which may limit how well the findings apply to the wider Alzheimer’s population. It was also open-label, meaning patients and doctors knew which treatment was being given, which could introduce bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, only patients with mild Alzheimer’s were included, so the results may not extend to those with more advanced disease. The study also could not determine whether the observed cognitive improvements were due directly to vortioxetine’s pharmacological effects or indirectly through relief of depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these caveats, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that vortioxetine may have cognitive benefits beyond its antidepressant effects. The authors suggest that larger, longer-term, and double-blind studies are needed to confirm these results and to clarify how vortioxetine’s effects on neurotransmitter systems might influence both mood and cognition in people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms these findings, vortioxetine could be considered a particularly useful option for Alzheimer’s patients who experience depression—addressing not only mood symptoms but also potentially helping to preserve certain cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877251340084" target="_blank"&gt;Differential effects of antidepressants on cognition in Alzheimer’s disease with depression: A sub-group analysis of an open-label, observational study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eduardo Cumbo and Daniela Migliore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 20:03:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOejg4ZXZYWUtrRVNJaEJCbjY4WGpaMUQta2ZWb0RqQmhpenpsNC1LX2pTbUF1YjMzN1JBSGgxVE1zdFRYYl9UY0xmbWsyLXJCTVp0M3poMGZlaFZ2ZFBpWUFvUk1YaDFiWUhMbnY4cXJHNWtVVXFIWG5ZOXVTR2duZ3laNjhOWWt5bVExeEJpdjh0aEdPT0tQUkxNd2dRcEIzZ3FlY3I0dWhva29IOVFUMnFqQ0pWVkQxbFdhTEdONHVWRjQ</guid></item><item><title>天然化合物组合恢复老化的脑细胞-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE0yN1NBMDFkckF3VzhEXzQ2a3VWbjRtelBZN1NVRmcxejctRjlFTGVaRlA5YkNrTTdrQWNESF9JZXB4dFhuQVQxRXpHcklRZ0ZjMmhzd2lDYi1sYVVGZnl0MTU1bHNjR2Y1SjFLZDI1UjdNdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists have identified a natural compound combination that reverses aging-related brain cell decline and removes harmful Alzheimer’s-linked proteins. The treatment, combining nicotinamide (vitamin B3) and the green tea antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate, restores guanosine triphosphate (GTP) levels—critical for neuronal energy and protein cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In aged neurons, the restored energy boosted protein clearance, reduced oxidative stress, and reactivated key cell trafficking pathways.

They discovered that free GTP levels declined with age – particularly in mitochondria, the cells’ energy hubs – leading to impaired autophagy, the process by which cells eliminate damaged components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when aged neurons were treated for just 24 hours with nicotinamide and epigallocatechin gallate, GTP levels were restored to those typically seen in younger cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This revival triggered a cascade of benefits: improved energy metabolism; activation of key GTPases involved in cellular trafficking, Rab7 and Arl8b; and efficient clearance of amyloid beta aggregates. Oxidative stress, another contributor to neurodegeneration, was also reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study highlights GTP as a previously underappreciated energy source driving vital brain functions,” Brewer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By supplementing the brain’s energy systems with compounds that are already available as dietary supplements, we may have a new path toward treating age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cautioned, “More work is going to be required to find the best way to administer this treatment, since a recent clinical trial involving UC Irvine researchers showed that oral nicotinamide was not very effective because of inactivation in the bloodstream.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewer’s collaborators were Ricardo Santana, a UC Irvine associate specialist in biomedical engineering, and Joshua McWhirt, a UC Irvine junior specialist who’s now a Ph.D. candidate at the Medical University of South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health and the UC Irvine Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this supplements and brain aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#52302230373e3e1227313b7c373627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brian Bell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://uci.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Brian Bell – UC Irvine&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-025-01786-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Treatment of age-related decreases in GTP levels restores endocytosis and autophagy&lt;/a&gt;” by Gregory Brewer et al. &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment of age-related decreases in GTP levels restores endocytosis and autophagy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related declines in neuronal bioenergetic levels may limit vesicular trafficking and autophagic clearance of damaged organelles and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age-related ATP depletion would impact cognition dependent on ionic homeostasis, but limits on proteostasis powered by GTP are less clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used neurons isolated from aged 3xTg-AD Alzheimer’s model mice and a novel genetically encoded fluorescent GTP sensor (GEVAL) to evaluate live GTP levels in situ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report an age-dependent reduction in ratiometric measurements of free/bound GTP levels in living hippocampal neurons. Free GTP colocalized in the mitochondria decreased with age accompanied by the accumulation of free GTP-labeled vesicular structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The energy dependence of autophagy was demonstrated by depletion of GTP with rapamycin stimulation, while bafilomycin inhibition of autophagy raised GTP levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four-hour supplementation of aged neurons with the NAD precursor nicotinamide and the Nrf2 redox modulator EGCG restored GTP levels to youthful levels and mobilized endocytosis and lysosomal consumption for autophagy via the respective GTPases Rab7 and Arl8b.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This vesicular mobilization promoted the clearance of intraneuronal Aβ aggregates, improved viability, and lowered protein oxidative nitration in AD model neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results reveal age- and AD-related neuronal GTP energy deficits that impair autophagy and endocytosis. GTP deficits were remediated by an external NAD precursor together with a Nrf2 redox modulator which suggests a translational path.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 19:53:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE0yN1NBMDFkckF3VzhEXzQ2a3VWbjRtelBZN1NVRmcxejctRjlFTGVaRlA5YkNrTTdrQWNESF9JZXB4dFhuQVQxRXpHcklRZ0ZjMmhzd2lDYi1sYVVGZnl0MTU1bHNjR2Y1SjFLZDI1UjdNdw</guid></item><item><title>在一碗木瓜中添加5样东西，让它成为一顿完整的早餐-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4wFBVV95cUxONU9KMFdzYkFQa2p4aFFYbDNIMHBnQlJkWkpNNnkyY2F0R0NJZFhkdS0zTThEREFYU25NYUZISWU0YUZHQW5mZ1Z3WmRhSjd6bG5pQWxac2R5cHFIMlpWUGlSTnhMdEVSSGt6U1dxdFpsU0dGbk9kMVVxZUNJYXg1VHVWbEM4Q1kyb0pYVHJ5OERXYThtZ3ZxanRMazFRNndDbVpqVTB0YU5zVnBaMUJHU1VkVThWQUFWdGZSLWxTT1g3eGlZVEFxQ25pa3p3c1hlV2RSS2FhdTB4T1Q1Mkpmd3lXY9IB6wFBVV95cUxPeTRORW5MMmRSbFgyeUJBQ00yR1BpVE1OMTM0WVZiUjZIaG1oeE1UYXQzVkgycjZzWndzRm5TdGpJakVFYXhZOTlaRjVwd210TG0wLTdmUl9XcEVtLUpXSGxQUExMTGFCOFFNLUl0WkY0LUhBd2lzcndlRURaNERpQkdDNE9aUUNvYndGdlAzR0c1YXVvTXFKQUtDbnN4b1YtWnhEYlhwbDI2NXpQcHBfWUpfRzRnRGtTMkVKdmdYanZlbDlRM3pNWGZGMmZCVk8wQnJ1aFMyMFlxSUp6dVFUR2dQdDlrY1ZFNzhj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the day with a bowl of papaya is always a good idea. Wondering why? Well, papaya is a nutrient-rich tropical fruit known for its digestive, immune-boosting, and skin-enhancing properties. It contains papain, an enzyme that aids digestion and prevents bloating. Packed with vitamin C, vitamin A, and antioxidants, papaya strengthens the immune system, improves vision, and promotes glowing skin. As per a study by the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6682863/"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the papaya pulp contains vitamins A, C, and E; B complex vitamins, such as pantothenic acid and folate; and minerals, such as magnesium and potassium, as well as food fibers. While this fruit is rich in many nutrients, adding some readily available ingredients to it can boost its nutritional value too. Take a look at these 5 things that one can add to a bowl of papaya to make it a complete breakfast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 09 Aug 2025 18:35:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>由于Excelsior海滩条件恶劣， Big Island和Back 10k Paddle取消- kare11.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi5AFBVV95cUxOZkswX1E5OGRQSU1QSU1KNzM2UldENm9SYmdjbGRZNkVwb1JtcmQzMUpydFhJSzJWS0lJU1RCTlpITzJkajFHT2hQX1JoOFBuQWQyZUdNS1dEX19WUGJTbFpwSzVMaFlMM1lHbC16UUExWXdoaDRKTHFudUwxaUhYbGZHY2RWMmhYb0Vub0dGUWsxSlp4Um5Kbk1NX1VBdy1pYjFtWU5OOHpxcUprVWJoMS1zMTVydmhIZG5mUFdOOGt4OWxybVd2SXUtNlllY2YzY2swZkw4S2lZX2t2TGdSZ1cyNDQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;The Freshwater Society canceled the event due to high E.coli levels reported at Excelsior Public Beach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EXCELSIOR, Minn. — Freshwater Society canceled this year's Big Island and Back 10K Paddle due to poor beach conditions in Excelsior and the surrounding area. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event, which was scheduled to happen on Saturday morning, was cancelled after the organizers learned that E.coli levels exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards at Excelsior Public Beach, according to the statement posted on social media. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They wrote that there was no way to safely host this event, given that the E.coli levels were "drastically" above the recommended levels. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers also noted they are unable to issue any refunds on event entry fees or future event credits. In the post, the Freshwater Society wrote that this cancellation has caused substantial expense. Instead, people were invited to join the gathering at the Excelsior Brewing for pizza, prizes, and beer at 11:00 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Facebook post, the Freshwater Society also called for reducing or eliminating the use of chemical fertilizers on individual properties to improve water quality. They noted that deep-rooted vegetation, instead of turf grass — even partially — can contribute to clean waters. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.coli is a type of bacteria, which in high amounts can cause diarrhea, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and other serious illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
