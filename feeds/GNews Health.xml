But over the following decade, something unusual happened. Five of the children stopped coming to the clinic to collect their drugs, and when the team eventually tracked them down many months later, they appeared to be in perfect health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Instead of their viral loads being through the roof, they were undetectable,” says Goulder. “And normally HIV rebounds within two or three weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03105-4"&gt;study published last year&lt;/a&gt;, Goulder described how all five remained in remission, despite having not received regular antiretroviral medication for some time, and in one case, up to 17 months. In the decades-long search for an HIV cure, this offered a tantalizing insight: that the first widespread success in curing HIV might not come in adults, but in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;At the recent International AIDS Society conference held in Kigali, Rwanda, in mid-July, Alfredo Tagarro, a pediatrician at the Infanta Sofia University Hospital in Madrid, presented a new study showing that around 5 percent of HIV-infected children who receive antiretrovirals within the first six months of life ultimately suppress the HIV viral reservoir—the number of cells harboring the virus’s genetic material—to negligible levels. “Children have special immunological features which makes it more likely that we will develop an HIV cure for them before other populations,” says Tagarro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;His thoughts were echoed by another doctor, Mark Cotton, who directs the children’s infectious diseases clinical research unit at the University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Kids have a much more dynamic immune system,” says Cotton. “They also don’t have any additional issues like high blood pressure or kidney problems. It makes them a better target, initially, for a cure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to Tagarro, children with HIV have long been “left behind” in the race to find a treatment that can put HIV-positive individuals permanently into remission. Since 2007, 10 adults are thought to have been cured, having received stem cell transplants to treat life-threatening blood cancer, a procedure which ended up eliminating the virus. Yet with such procedures being both complex and highly risky—other patients have died in the aftermath of similar attempts—it is not considered a viable strategy for specifically targeting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Instead, like Goulder, pediatricians have increasingly noticed that after starting antiretroviral treatment early in life, a small subpopulation of children then seem able to suppress HIV for months, years, and perhaps even permanently with their immune system alone. This realization initially began with certain isolated case studies: the “Mississippi baby” &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4240852/"&gt;who controlled&lt;/a&gt; the virus for more than two years without medication, and a South African child who was considered &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/what-can-science-learn-child-who-has-controlled-hiv-without-drugs-more-8-years"&gt;potentially cured&lt;/a&gt; having kept the virus in remission for more than a decade. Cotton says he suspects that between 10 and 20 percent of all HIV-infected children would be capable of controlling the virus for a significant period of time, beyond the typical two to three weeks, after stopping antiretrovirals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 13:19:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxQUDJHWnVsNFVUaDRtRHRQSnRWQmxwUUlMOW5aaTl1NUIxbHVsb3dsSlRhN2pBOE9JZUN4N0hLYnNRenVQWUFjX1dOdk41VkNQWkM1TzJubFl2WE9nODFNdjdneHYzSkdCNmRuSXA4VW12MWVyTHZlSnRTVnY1RzZOT1E4VFM2bU1iandn</guid></item><item><title>研究显示， “运动失调”现象可能影响三分之一的人- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxQdnFnUk4tY0JhRjdFWmFrVFl6VXpNOWNPci1IX085NXEyNGVUZnpEWFlMUGw1djBFOGNPU3dyQlZ6SGF2dUxVcDlDS0psVGZ1Yk0tbGVnbkZBVGdjYVl5NWFMajBJbmV5a2dJaFdIWkFYQ0wtdVlKbHA2MFpfVDNzUjMtLU53NjZYWGlZcS10SC1oU1h2NllJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Noticing somebody fidgeting can be distracting. Vexing. Even excruciating. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a study published in 2021, the stressful sensations caused by seeing others fidget are an incredibly common psychological phenomenon, affecting as many as one in three people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://www.misokinesia.ca"&gt;misokinesia&lt;/a&gt; – meaning 'hatred of movements' – this strange phenomenon had been little studied by scientists until recent years, but was noted in the context of a related condition, &lt;a href="a-super-sensitive-brain-connection-could-be-why-some-people-can-t-stand-certain-sounds"&gt;misophonia&lt;/a&gt;: a disorder where people become &lt;a href="can-t-stand-the-sound-of-people-chewing-blame-your-brain-science-misophonia"&gt;irritated upon hearing certain repetitious sounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misokinesia is somewhat similar, but the triggers are generally more visual, rather than sound-related, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary on the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Misokinesia] is defined as a strong negative affective or emotional response to the sight of someone else's small and repetitive movements, such as seeing someone mindlessly fidgeting with a hand or foot," a team of researchers, led by first author and psychologist Sumeet Jaswal, then at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;explained in a study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yet surprisingly, scientific research on the topic is lacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/angry-outbursts-could-literally-be-putting-some-peoples-heart-at-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Angry Outbursts Could Literally Be Putting Some People's Heart at Risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding, Jawal and fellow researchers conducted what they said was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;"first in-depth scientific exploration"&lt;/a&gt; of misokinesia – and the results indicate that heightened sensitivity to fidgeting is something a large number of people have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across a series of experiments involving over 4,100 participants, the researchers measured the prevalence of misokinesia in a cohort of university students and people from the general population, assessing the impacts it had upon them, and exploring why the sensations might manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg" alt="hands fidgeting" class="wp-image-144167 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Misokinesia creates strong emotional responses on seeing small, repetitive movements. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that approximately one-third self-reported some degree of misokinesia sensitivity to the repetitive, fidgeting behaviors of others as encountered in their daily lives," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results support the conclusion that misokinesia sensitivity is not a phenomenon restricted to clinical populations, but rather, is a basic and heretofore under-recognized social challenge shared by many in the wider, general population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the analysis, misokinesia sometimes goes hand in hand with the sound-sensitivity of misophonia, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon seems to vary significantly among individuals, with some people reporting only low sensitivity to fidgeting stimuli, while others feel highly affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are negatively impacted emotionally and experience reactions such as anger, anxiety, or frustration as well as reduced enjoyment in social situations, work, and learning environments," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; UBC psychologist Todd Handy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some even pursue fewer social activities because of the condition.".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Handy began researching misokinesia after a partner told him he was a fidgeter and confessed she felt stress when he fidgeted (or anybody else for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a visual cognitive neuroscientist, this really piqued my interest to find out what is happening in the brain," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the million-dollar question stands: Why do we find fidgeting so annoying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers ran tests to see if people's misokinesia might originate in heightened visual-attentional sensitivities, amounting to an inability to block out distracting events occurring in their visual periphery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results based on early experiments were inconclusive on that front, with the researchers finding no firm evidence that reflexive visual attentional mechanisms substantively contribute to misokinesia sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we're still only at the outset then of exploring where misokinesia may spring from on a cognitive level, the researchers do have some hypothetical leads for future research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One possibility we want to explore is that their '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"&gt;mirror neurons&lt;/a&gt;' are at play," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These neurons activate when we move but they also activate when we see others move… For example, when you see someone get hurt, you may wince as well, as their pain is mirrored in your own brain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By extension, it's possible that misokinesia-prone people might be unconsciously empathizing with the psychology of fidgeters. And not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A reason that people fidget is because they're anxious or nervous so when individuals who suffer from misokinesia see someone fidgeting, they may mirror it and feel anxious or nervous as well," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to whether that's what's really going on here with misokinesia, only further research into the phenomenon will be able to say for sure. A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0313169"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Jaswal in 2024 on 21 volunteers found the condition may be linked to challenges in disengaging from a stimulus, rather than about the initial distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though. From the results seen here, it's clear that this unusual phenomenon is much more usual than we realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To those who are suffering from misokinesia, you are not alone," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;. "Your challenge is common and it's real."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are reported in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Roughly 80% are not diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It really opens up a lot of new avenues for personalized sleep medicine," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT TO KNOW&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since the FDA approved Zepbound&lt;/strong&gt; to help treat obstructive sleep apnea in some patients with obesity six months ago, Long Islanders have been flooding sleep centers with questions and interest about the medication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts say the drug can help people lose weight&lt;/strong&gt; which may ease the symptoms of their obstructive sleep apnea, but it is not necessarily a cure for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/strong&gt; should speak with sleep medicine experts and undergo an evaluation before starting any new treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also marks another step in the use of the increasingly popular — and pricey — GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) medications to tackle chronic health issues including diabetes, weight management, and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said that by losing weight, obese patients may get some relief from their &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459252/" target="_blank"&gt;obstructive sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; — a condition in which people stop breathing dozens of times a night because their airway becomes narrowed or blocked when the muscles of the throat relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to these events, the brain sends a signal to wake the person up so they can start breathing again, a cycle that repeats while their sleep. This often leaves them exhausted and unfocused throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="img Image_img__VNXHO landscape lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="David Warkentin, system director for Catholic Health Sleep Service at..." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANDM4NjM5NDktM2Y4Yi00%3AODViMjM1NTQtMjczMS00%2Fcopy-of-lisleep250720_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=828&amp;amp;q=80 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANDM4NjM5NDktM2Y4Yi00%3AODViMjM1NTQtMjczMS00%2Fcopy-of-lisleep250720_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3ANDM4NjM5NDktM2Y4Yi00%3AODViMjM1NTQtMjczMS00%2Fcopy-of-lisleep250720_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Warkentin, system director for Catholic Health Sleep Service at St. Charles Hospital in Port Jefferson, outfits a mannequin head with a CPAP mask and EEG electrodes on Thursday. Credit: Newsday/Drew Singh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight can help reduce fatty deposits in the airway, said Dr. Gary Wohlberg, director of the South Shore University Hospital Sleep Center, reducing the chance it will become blocked during sleep. Obese sleep apnea patients may struggle with dieting and exercise and the drug can give them a "head start." In addition, he added, "you really want to change your behavior and it should be coupled with nutritional information and activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Avram Gold, medical director of Stony Brook University’s Sleep Disorders Center, said he is skeptical of the claims that weight loss will make lasting changes for people with obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It can make a difference in how they feel," he said. "But it won’t bring them back to normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond weight loss, the drugs may also be interacting with the body in other ways to reduce sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a theory that some of these drugs, particularly Zepbound, may also reduce inflammation and thereby improve airflow," Wohlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warkentin said researchers are also looking into whether the drug has a protective effect on brain cells that could improve the brain's ability to regulate breathing during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessing medication can also be challenging for patients. Not all health insurance companies &lt;a href="https://www.newsday.com/business/wegovy-ozempic-glp1-weight-loss-drugs-gwtq9vrf" target="_blank"&gt;cover weight-loss drugs&lt;/a&gt; and those that do may require participants have a body mass index considered overweight with certain chronic illnesses or be obese. The medicine costs about $1,000 a month for those who must pay out of pocket. Just because Zepbound was approved to treat sleep apnea doesn't guarantee insurance coverage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A patient's experience&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in late 2023, Diana Bonilla, 34, of Patchogue was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea, a condition she said started in recent years as she got older and gained weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wanted to try something other than traditional treatments, which involve use of a continuous positive airway pressure machine, also known as a CPAP machine, or oral appliances worn in a person's mouth while they sleep. People who use CPAP machines wear a mask connected to a machine that sends a stream of pressurized air which keeps the airway from closing during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was going to try weight loss," said Bonilla. "I was at 203 pounds, the heaviest I have ever been. And I’m only 4-foot-11 so that’s a lot."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She started Zepbound in May 2024 and is down to 134 pounds. Bonilla, an administrative assistant at Northwell Health, said she has more energy, her husband reports she no longer snores, and follow-up tests showed no signs of sleep apnea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it’s the best thing invented," Bonilla said of the medication. "But you also have to change your eating habits and try to be healthier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warkentin and other sleep medicine experts emphasized Zepbound is not a "magic bullet" and any treatment must look at numerous factors in a person’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone with obstructive sleep apnea is obese. Patients may have physiological issues — such as a large tongue or tonsils — that make breathing during sleep more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight can ease symptoms. However, a person needs sleep tests and to work with specialists to determine the best treatment plan, Warkentin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody’s hoping for that quick fix but it’s a journey," he said. "I think as providers we have to make sure we educate our patients and that we are transparent and we temper expectations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep apnea warning signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with sleep apnea may not recognize the warning signs or dismiss them, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Often, people relate their tiredness and fatigue to a lot of other things," said Dr. Andrew Namen, a pulmonologist and sleep apnea expert at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine in North Carolina and a spokesman for the &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having symptoms like snoring, choking, gasping for breath should alert you to talk to your provider," Namen said. "People think it’s not a serious condition but we now know sleep apnea has been associated with significant heart- and stroke-related events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold said he believes sleep apnea is actually linked to chronic stress and that his research has associated sleep apnea with chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome and, possibly, long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sleep apnea patients who are obese have also tried weight loss surgery to bring down their weight and the extra pressure on their bodies that can make it hard to breathe well while they rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Spronz’s bout with sleep apnea was just part of a lifelong battle with sleep disorders. He had his first sleep test at the age of 14 after years of being on stimulants for the bursts of hyperactivity that came when he wasn’t tired or distracted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They diagnosed him with "REM behavior disorder." Rapid Eye Movement or REM is the stage of sleep that involves dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You act out whatever you are dreaming," said Spronz, 42, a nurse practitioner in psychiatry who lives in Port Jefferson. "You are never actually hitting REM sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep medicine didn’t work and in time he gained weight, going up to 247 pounds. After falling asleep behind the wheel of his car while stopped at a light, Spronz realized he needed more help. Another sleep study led to the use of a CPAP machine, bariatric surgery and use of a weight loss drug that helped him drop 100 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is still following up with treatments due to the complexity of his sleep disorders, and doctors have told him he no longer needs the CPAP machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing weight was "one piece of the puzzle," Spronz said. "It certainly is not the cure to sleep apnea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="Lisa L.

                Doctors are criticizing a recent expert panel organized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that questioned the safety of taking antidepressants during pregnancy.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly one in five pregnant women and new moms in this country &lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mental-health-fact-sheet/#ed3bf220-6f23-44db-893a-1beb9664ba04" target="_blank"&gt;suffers from anxiety and depression&lt;/a&gt;. And 6-8% of pregnant women are prescribed a group of antidepressants called Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But a recent expert panel organized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cast doubt on the safety of SSRIs — even though these drugs are largely considered safe by healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those comments have sparked a swath of criticism from a number of prominent medical societies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Untreated or undertreated depression during pregnancy carries health risks, such as suicide, preterm birth, preeclampsia, and low birth weight," &lt;a href="https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-statement-on-ssris-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine &lt;/a&gt;wrote in a statement late last month. "Unfortunately, misinformation about depression and its treatment creates confusion and doubt among patients and the public leading to unnecessary barriers to care."&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Opening the panel discussion on FDA on July 21, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said that SSRIs have been "implicated" by studies to be involved in a range of health effects, including pulmonary hypertension and cardiac defects in babies. Then a majority of the panelists, including psychiatrists, psychologists and a social work professor, cited studies they said illustrate serious health risks, like miscarriage and autism.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Several groups of healthcare providers, including the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ncrptraining.org/press-release-ncrp-responds-to-fda-panel-on-ssri-use-in-pregnancy/" target="_blank"&gt;National Curriculum for Reproductive Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; have spoken out against many of the claims made by the panel, saying that it misrepresented evidence and spread misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"As experts in high-risk pregnancies, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) and its members are alarmed by the unsubstantiated and inaccurate claims made by FDA panelists concerning maternal depression and the use of SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy," according to &lt;a href="https://www.smfm.org/news/smfm-statement-on-ssris-and-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;the statement from SMFM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Robust evidence" illustrates the safety of SSRI use in pregnancy, &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/07/statement-on-benefit-of-access-to-ssris-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;according to the ACOG statement&lt;/a&gt;, which added that most of these medications "do not increase the risk of birth defects."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Responding to that criticism, spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, Andrew Nixon wrote this to NPR in an email: "The claim that the FDA's expert advisory process is one-sided or politically driven is insulting to the independent scientists, clinicians, and researchers."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Scientific 'apples and oranges' &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the studies cited by the panelists as evidence of harm didn't even involve pregnant and postpartum women, says&lt;a href="https://uvahealth.com/findadoctor/Jennifer-Payne-1689614604" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Jennifer Payne&lt;/a&gt;, a reproductive psychiatrist at the University of Virginia and a past president of the &lt;a href="https://marcenortham.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Marcé of North America&lt;/a&gt;, an organization working to prevent and treat mental health conditions during and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, British psychiatrist&lt;a href="https://joannamoncrieff.com/" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Joanna Moncrieff &lt;/a&gt;referenced a study in youth linking SSRIs to increased suicidality in a "very small proportion of" those taking the medication, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Many of the studies referenced by some panelists have been disproven, notes Payne, like the papers linking SSRI use in pregnancy to cardiac defects in infants. "That has been debunked over and over," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And several studies mentioned on the panel were "poorly controlled," says Payne.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So if you're comparing a pregnant patient who was taking an SSRI, the control group should be the pregnant patient with mental health abnormalities who hasn't taken an SSRI," explains &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/about/leadership-and-governance/leadership-team" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Christopher Zahn&lt;/a&gt;, chief of Clinical practice with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or ACOG, who wasn't part of the panel. "And part of the problem with a number of those studies [cited by panelists] is they don't use the right control group. It's really apples and oranges."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And studies that are well-controlled — in other words, those that compare pregnant women on SSRIs with pregnant women with mental health conditions not taking the drugs — do not find the risks highlighted by the FDA panel.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The use of SSRIs in pregnancy is extremely well studied," says &lt;a href="https://profiles.umassmed.edu/display/133369" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nancy Byatt&lt;/a&gt;, a perinatal psychiatrist at the UMass Chan School of Medicine. "We have data on hundreds and thousands of individuals exposed to SSRIs in pregnancy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That data show that by and large, SSRI's are safe. "What the overall data shows is that antidepressants are not associated with major birth defects," says Byatt. And neither are they associated with a significantly higher risk of miscarriage or postpartum hemorrhage, as suggested by some panelists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The impacts of untreated perinatal depression &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One issue that was not discussed enough by the panel, according to Byatt and other experts on perinatal mental health, is the well-documented health impacts of untreated mental health symptoms in pregnant and postpartum women. Only one panelist, &lt;a href="https://ufhealth.org/doctors/kay-roussos-ross" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kay Roussos-Ross&lt;/a&gt;, OBGYN and perinatal psychiatrist at the University of Florida, spelled out those impacts.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"When mental health conditions go untreated, these women are less likely to attend their prenatal care appointments and they're more likely to use substances during their pregnancy," said Roussos-Ross. "They are also more likely to face additional risks, such as pre-eclampsia and cesarean delivery." They're also at a higher risk of suicide, she said. Mental health remains&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2814936" target="_blank"&gt; the leading cause of maternal deaths &lt;/a&gt;in the United States, including deaths from suicide.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And there's this huge literature on the effects of postpartum depression, on IQ, language development, behavioral problems" in children, says Payne. "It's as clear as a bell that you want mom to be well, during pregnancy and postpartum."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;However, SSRIs aren't the only treatment option for pregnant and postpartum women, say Payne and others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have a lot of tools in our toolbox," says Byatt.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For mild depression or anxiety, the first line of treatment is psychotherapy, or talk therapy, she says. "We have evidence-based psychotherapies that we can, should and do use in pregnancy and postpartum."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's also psychosocial treatments, like peer support, which can be very helpful in improving pregnant women's and new moms' symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adding practices like exercise, yoga and meditation to those treatments is also something Byatt recommends to her patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Often people can't access therapy quickly because of lack of insurance or even if people do have insurance, it's extraordinarily challenging for people to access evidence-based quality therapy," notes Byatt.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So for those women, and ones with moderate to severe symptoms, she says, SSRIs are a helpful option.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            As Covid-19 transmission ramps up in the United States, recent changes to federal vaccine guidance have left many Americans confused about the latest policies and concerned about access to shots this fall.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500043b6nfm6ny2mf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US has had a summer surge in Covid-19 case﻿s each year since the pandemic began. This year, however, experts say that the seasonal wave is starting later than anticipated and is relatively subdued. &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/tracker/?charts=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&amp;amp;selectedChartId=ee1a57" target="_blank"&gt;Surveillance data from WastewaterSCAN&lt;/a&gt; shows that median Covid-19 concentrations ticked up from June to July, with high levels in some parts of the country, but overall, it’s far below this time last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500053b6njhmb87ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My hypothesis was that the weak winter wave would set the stage for a bigger summer, because many people would not have recent immunity. So far, activity has been more sedate than I anticipated,” epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers wrote in her newsletter Sunday. “I remain open-minded about what August will bring. My best guess is continued increases until early September, but I am uncertain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500063b6nnfv8xtw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although it’s too early to know how big the current uptick will be or how long it will last, Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health, says her key concern is whether Covid-19 vaccines will be available “in time to protect people, especially those at high risk, against severe illness.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500073b6nl61mdai9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My biggest worry at this point is the uncertainty about when updated Covid vaccines will become available and who will be able to get them,” Nuzzo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500083b6n560d0w6b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-covid-19-vaccine-update" target="_blank"&gt;New survey data from KFF&lt;/a&gt; published Friday shows that most adults in the US don’t plan to get a Covid-19 vaccine this fall, but most who do plan to get the shot share concerns that the vaccine won’t be available to them and that their insurance won’t cover the cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os500093b6nafnxk26x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past few months, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said that the Covid-19 shot &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;will no longer be recommended&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and pregnant women, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/kennedy-new-members-vaccine-advisory-panel"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; a federal vaccine advisory panel and announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/25/health/cdc-acip-vaccine-meeting"&gt;plans to examine&lt;/a&gt; the well-established federal childhood vaccine schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds39om700013b6nwbrlfqjz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the latest survey, KFF polled a nationally representative sample of nearly 1,300 adults between July 8 and 14 – at least two weeks after each of these events.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000a3b6nsic3u84n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a quarter of US adults say Kennedy has made “major” changes to vaccine policy in the US, but another 40% “don’t know enough to say,” the KFF poll found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000b3b6n5eudzqpz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of those who do plan to get a Covid-19 vaccine this fall – more likely to be older adults and Democrats – about two-thirds say they are concerned that it might not be available to them. And more than 60% of insured adults who plan to get the shot are worried that their insurance won’t cover it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000c3b6nn2lwn7rq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About half of parents are not sure whether federal health agencies are currently recommending that healthy children receive a Covid-19 vaccine this fall, according to the new KFF data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000d3b6n99riit7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy announced that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will not formally recommend the Covid-19 vaccine for healthy children, leaving decisions to be made between parents and their health care provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000e3b6nlfitmkk2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            KFF found that personal doctors or health care providers remain the most trusted source for information about vaccines, with 8 in 10 adults saying they trust their own doctor at least “a fair amount.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000f3b6nwpbtygry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trust in local health departments and the CDC has been eroding over the past two years, but most adults still say they trust these sources for vaccine information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000g3b6n7jgph5ql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But far fewer – only 37% of adults – say they trust Kennedy at least “a fair amount” to provide information on vaccines, according to KFF. When asked about the impact of the changes to federal vaccine policy, more than a third of adults said they are making people less safe. Only 1 in 5 said the changes are making people safer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000h3b6nsq48mvy9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rivers says she recommends that people who want their annual Covid-19 get it sooner rather than later.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmds34os5000i3b6nr7i7dlwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The big drawback is, it is not updated yet; the new formulation will be released closer to autumn,” she said, but getting a shot now will offer protection against the unpredictable summer wave and get ahead of access concerns that may arise in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Inflammatory diets full of processed meat and sugar may accelerate it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden studied four diets to investigate their impact on chronic diseases in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the diets studied were healthy and focused on the intake of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats and reduced intake of sweets, red meat, processed meat and butter/margarine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth diet, however, was pro-inflammatory and focused on red and processed meat, refined grains and sweetened beverages, with lower intake of vegetables, tea and coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-awdjp1-0 kKmZLZ"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/17/12/iStock-1205263643.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/17/12/iStock-1205263643.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/17/12/iStock-1205263643.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Researchers found eating a healthy diet was linked to a slower accumulation of chronic diseases (File picture)" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-49906"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Researchers found eating a healthy diet was linked to a slower accumulation of chronic diseases (File picture)&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers followed the diets of 2,400 adults aged 60 and older in Sweden for 15 years and tracked their chronic conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary intake was measured using food frequency questionnaires, and adherence to four dietary patterns: the Empirical Dietary Inflammatory Index (EDII), AHEI, the Alternate &lt;a href="/topic/mediterranean"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; Diet (AMED), and the MIND (Mediterranean–DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multimorbidity was defined as the number of chronic diseases and grouped by organ system - musculoskeletal, &lt;a href="/topic/cardiovascular"&gt;cardiovascular&lt;/a&gt;, and neuropsychiatric. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results published in the journal &lt;a href="/topic/nature"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Aging&lt;/em&gt; revealed those who followed the healthy diets had a slower development of chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, long-term adherence to healthy dietary patterns, particularly the AMED, AHEI, and MIND, was linked to a slower accumulation of chronic diseases in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This applied to cardiovascular disease and dementia, but not to diseases related to muscles and bones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those who followed the pro-inflammatory diet, on the other hand, increased their risk of chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”Our results show how important diet is in influencing the development of multimorbidity in ageing populations,” said co-first author Adrián Carballo-Casla, postdoctoral researcher at the Aging Research Centre, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protective effects of diet may be explained by reduced &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, a key factor in aging-related diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study authors want to further their research by identify the dietary recommendations that may have the greatest impact on longevity and the groups of older adults who may benefit most from them, based on their age, gender, psychosocial background and chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 07:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxOa3QtRnlsWFQyN3ZzVXI2Sy1WSjNtd055V29lZi1jRDFRMDRYVTUtUTNqR2EycC1RcnhyVXA2QjZfdVgzcmZ6YVFfZUtMNW5SbjM1WW10cjRqa0U2a0hwZHFnMzcyUG1Ba3REbU1hRkFsWTF5NGZQakNEZ0RTRGJKUFZmTmhldVRwOHpNTVdod2szUQ</guid></item><item><title>神经病学家对流行的运动后练习发出警告： “这可能会引发中风” -每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPbjJIak1QeDhkS3pIZ0p5eEZXdEdvLU1CZDljbXQ3RzJYVlhrWUlreTJhbFlKbGN3MHpCMmZDSk8ydG5pellrUGxJUzRBUXY2cGtscVFnb25DeVpEZlhhUmsxQy1ZVXNhLVpQQW5vNUNRaTB1ZXJ5SUNWOTl0c3lUOFZWdGllTmV4RHRjWUNNd19KeG5nQ2fSAZsBQVVfeXFMTmhidmV6QVd2S2lRWTBTdUEya1VjdUpldm5PZzRjenctRHRYUG5WSUpOVGJ3aHFFSjV3UkY1M19pQk40VVlvTVV6Nkk5dHZjcDJ0anFmSWI5UllKeFV3Tm10N1h0eUVodU5nV0YtSTFBNjVWTmQxV1RQcXR6ODYxcGhXQ1loNS1FV0RXWkRTNmJZWlM5LXpteFdkRUU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading neurologist has issued an urgent warning over using a massage gun to relieve neck tension as this could trigger a potentially life-threatening stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Baibing Chen, from the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/michigan/index.html" id="mol-e8d94d60-6e11-11f0-8298-6f14688d8a4e"&gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; shared the warning with his 163,000 Instagram followers, stating that this is one of three common activities he would never do to protect his brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHKIydFMK7M/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, which has been viewed over 8million times, he also urged his followers to stop blasting loud music through headphones and warned against holding in a sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would never use a massage gun on my neck,' the neurologist said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because the vertebral and carotid arteries in the neck are vulnerable to damage from the repetitive shear forces from a massage gun.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These arteries make up a vital part of the circulatory system and supply the brain with blood and life-giving oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Chen added that this repetitive damage can increase the risk of an artery tearing, encouraging the formation of blood clots, restricting blood flow and triggering a stroke. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A stroke is a serious medical event that can cause permanent brain damage or even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Chen warned his followers against using massage guns to relieve neck tension, blasting loud music through their headphones and holding in a sneeze&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Dr Chen added that using a muscle gun with direct pressure can also dislodge hidden plaques that line the artery wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This can cause a clot to travel to the brain and lead to an ischemic stroke.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This happens when a blockage cuts off blood supply to part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, around a quarter of strokes in the UK are caused by a narrowing or blockage of the carotid arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main symptoms of a stroke can happen suddenly and include facial weakness where one side of the face may fall making it hard to smile; arm weakness which impacts a person's ability to lift both arms; and speech problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who thinks they are having a stroke are urged to call 999 immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other symptoms include weakness or numbness down one side of the body, blurred vision, confusion and memory loss, headaches and nausea or vomiting.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stroke is a leading global cause of death and disability.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are more than 100,000 strokes in the UK each year, about one every five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For this reason, Dr Chen also warned against holding in a sneeze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'This is because sneezing generates high internal pressure that's higher than car tire pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Holding [a sneeze] in forces this pressure into delicate areas and may lead to ruptured ear drums, torn throat tissues and even air leaking into the chest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In rare cases the sudden spike in pressure can rupture blood vessels in the brain leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage or intracerebral bleeding—especially in individuals with aneurysms or weakened arteries.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This type of hemorrhage is an uncommon type of stroke caused by bleeding on the surface of the brain which can be fatal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this instance, there are usually no warning signs but according to the NHS this type of stroke can happen during physical effort or straining, such as coughing, holding in a sneeze or lifting something heavy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common symptoms include a sudden excruciating headache, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, typical stroke-like symptoms and loss of consciousness.  &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; A subarachnoid haemorrhage is considered a medical emergency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, Dr Chen advised turning down the volume before plugging in headphones.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Loud music isn't just bad for your ears it's actually bad for your brain as well,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tackling hearing loss early could delay the development of dementia for a number of years, promising new research suggested this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies have long suggested that around four in 10 cases of the memory-robbing condition could be preventable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now experts believe that up to a third of cases could be attributed to hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is because when the brain struggles to process sound it reallocates resources away from memory and thinking, increasing cognitive decline,' Dr Chen explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dementia affects around 982,000 people in the UK and studies show that those with untreated hearing problems may be up to give times more likely to develop the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sounds over 85 decibels, similar to city traffic, can cause damage over time whereas exposure to 100 plus decibels, like a concert or many earbuds at max volume can cause permanent hearing loss in as little as 15 minutes,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 07:32:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPbjJIak1QeDhkS3pIZ0p5eEZXdEdvLU1CZDljbXQ3RzJYVlhrWUlreTJhbFlKbGN3MHpCMmZDSk8ydG5pellrUGxJUzRBUXY2cGtscVFnb25DeVpEZlhhUmsxQy1ZVXNhLVpQQW5vNUNRaTB1ZXJ5SUNWOTl0c3lUOFZWdGllTmV4RHRjWUNNd19KeG5nQ2fSAZsBQVVfeXFMTmhidmV6QVd2S2lRWTBTdUEya1VjdUpldm5PZzRjenctRHRYUG5WSUpOVGJ3aHFFSjV3UkY1M19pQk40VVlvTVV6Nkk5dHZjcDJ0anFmSWI5UllKeFV3Tm10N1h0eUVodU5nV0YtSTFBNjVWTmQxV1RQcXR6ODYxcGhXQ1loNS1FV0RXWkRTNmJZWlM5LXpteFdkRUU</guid></item><item><title>保持敏锐、健康的心灵和海滩日的平静：健康与幸福的一周-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPY1BmSFdTOVBEaGt0ZzBzRm00NEtQSkVUTld5VkhCVW5Cc3Fqd214YW44M3QzVVdVcnI1R05Xa0REeDB2LTI4SnJYdDc3QmlBLUpUd2VCNjhFYzViaFpHMGFNQ1Rqc3Q5aTV4T3k5Nk1uQk52WU1DRjdaRVl6MnpMM09QVVdCclV4SV9uTTlLWjNqQXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VEMDWBZ2IFCW3CMYPWF72HSXRI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;You’re reading our weekly Well+Being newsletter. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/newsletters/well-being/?method=SURL&amp;amp;location=ART&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2&amp;amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up here&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BDS3KYR6LVC7FIUU3I2ZXJ74JY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This week we’re thinking about healthy brains and hearts. The two are so closely linked, and we know what’s good for one is often good for the other. We were excited to see some of the strongest evidence to date that you can protect your brain health with exercise, healthy eating, social interaction and brain games. A new study looked at people at risk of developing dementia because of a family history or other factors, and found a “recipe” of lifestyle changes helped improve their cognitive function. About 45 percent of all dementia cases might be preventable, according to other research, so this is incredible news for anyone (everyone?) who’s worried about their memory or brain health as they age. And back to that heart-mind connection. Those very same lifestyle changes that are so good for your brain often help your heart. Cardiologist Eric Topol shared 10 science-based ways to protect your ticker — plus there’s an online tool you can use to find out how “old” your heart is! — and I’m sure our minds would benefit, too. But before that …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="GBRUOROFKBGXHJ7M6XROR3MGOQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;This week’s must-reads:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="6VOS4GDES5ACNFDGLCSBNZVCDU" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here’s how to embrace the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/29/blue-spaces-calming/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;benefits of ‘blue health’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She ended up with a bat in her mouth — and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/31/rabies-vaccine-cost/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;$21,000 in medical bills&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Picking up the pace &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/27/walking-cadence-aging-health-improvement/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;on your walk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helps, even for older adults&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A 100-year-old on a bike?

Certain foods can help reduce LDL and increase High-density lipoprotein (HDL), aka, the good cholesterol. Here is a list of foods that will help lower bad cholesterol levels if you take them in the right way. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Oats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

This can provide about 1 to 2 grams of soluble fiber. Fiber, particularly beta-glucan, helps to reduce the absorption of cholesterol into the bloodstream. You can top your oatmeal with some fruits such as bananas or berries. This can add another half gram of fiber. Soluble fiber can bind cholesterol and its precursors in the digestive system and drag them out of the body before they get into circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One effective way to lower &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-effective-ways-to-lower-bad-cholesterol/articleshow/122887477.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is to replace meat with fatty fish. Meat is high in saturated fats that raise LDL. Fatty fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. These can lower triglycerides and protect the heart by reducing the risk of irregular heartbeats. Try incorporating fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, tuna (especially albacore), trout, and herring. You can add these fish a couple of times a week to lower bad cholesterol and boost cardiovascular health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Late Dinners Linked to High Cholesterol Levels, Experts Warn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Beans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat your beans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, they are excellent sources of soluble fiber. These fibers stay longer in your digestive system, which means you will feel full for longer after a meal. Think of adding navy beans, kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas (garbanzo beans), black-eyed peas, pinto beans, black beans, and lima beans. Beans are also good for those trying to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go nuts! Nuts are associated with lower rates of heart disease and stroke. One of the reasons is that they lower LDL levels and also improve the quality of LDL particles. You can add almonds, walnuts, peanuts, and other nuts to your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.121.054051" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Walnuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, in particular, are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids (alpha-linolenic acid), which are beneficial for cardiovascular health. Consuming 2 ounces of nuts a day can lower LDL by about 5%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Supreme Court Pushes Central Govt to Finalise FOPL: What It Means &amp;amp; Why It Matters? | Explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fruits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Apples, grapes, strawberries, and citrus fruits are all excellent sources of pectin, a type of soluble fiber known to help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol. This compound binds to cholesterol in the digestive system and removes it before it gets absorbed into the bloodstream. Regular consumption of these fruits not only supports heart health but also contributes to overall well-being, as they are rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and other nutrients that the body needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is for informational purposes only and is not intended as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

&lt;p&gt;In general, all three experts say that avoiding ultra-processed foods and fatty meats (like sausage or bacon) at breakfast is one big way to ensure your morning meal is adding years to your life instead of subtracting them. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538973/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Scientific research shows&lt;/a&gt; that a diet high in ultra-processed foods is directly linked to reducing lifespan. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2803089/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715" data-affiliate="true"&gt;eating red or processed meat regularly&lt;/a&gt; increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts say minimizing added sugar at breakfast is another way to add years to your life. That means avoiding sugary cereals, flavored yogurts and pastries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a longevity-supporting breakfast, focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods that provide a balance of healthy fats, proteins and complex carbohydrates. Incorporate plenty of antioxidants from fruits like berries, healthy fats from nuts, seeds, or avocados and fiber-rich vegetables or whole grains,” Sehgal advised. He also said that including probiotic-rich foods like yogurt or miso, as Bhanote’s breakfast does, can support gut health, which plays a critical role in overall well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes to no surprise that plants reign supreme when it comes to the breakfasts of choice for longevity experts. Consider this a reminder to get your fill of them in the morning. While vegetables are often regulated to lunch and dinner, incorporating them into your breakfast along with an unprocessed protein source is a science-backed way to increase your lifespan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting your morning by adding years to your life? Not too shabby of a way to start the day. Use it to set the tone and keep the longevity-supporting habits coming. With hope, you’ll be doing them for many, many years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-breakfasts-for-long-life_l_67004049e4b0c12c1d3bd133" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7916715"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sehgal’s breakfast is similar: a veggie omelet made with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms and, sometimes, a little cheese. “I usually pair it with a side of avocado or some smoked salmon if I’m feeling fancy,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Both of the experts say an egg/veggie breakfast is loaded with nutrients scientifically connected to longevity. “This kind of breakfast is great because it’s loaded with protein, which is great for your musculoskeletal health. The veggies add a bunch of vitamins and antioxidants, as well as fiber, which are great for gut health. Additionally, the healthy fats from the avocado or salmon are awesome for your cardiac and cognitive health,” Sehgal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32307193/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:One scientific study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;One scientific study&lt;/a&gt; that took into account more than 18,000 adults found that eating eggs regularly was not only linked to a lower mortality rate, but that it &lt;em&gt;significantly&lt;/em&gt; lowered total mortality.

The cashew miso dressing Bhanote drizzles on top provides protein and unsaturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When Bhanote opts for coconut yogurt for breakfast, she gets her protein from the yogurt and hemp seeds. “Hemp seeds are an excellent source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in an optimal ratio, supporting heart health and reducing inflammation,” Bhanote said. She also pointed out that the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7953067/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:probiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt; in coconut yogurt promote a healthy gut microbiome, which helps reduce inflammation and supports a strong immune system, which are both essential for longevity.

Incorporate plenty of antioxidants from fruits like berries, healthy fats from nuts, seeds, or avocados and fiber-rich vegetables or whole grains,” Sehgal advised. He also said that including probiotic-rich foods like yogurt or miso, as Bhanote’s breakfast does, can support gut health, which plays a critical role in overall well-being and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It comes to no surprise that plants reign supreme when it comes to the breakfasts of choice for longevity experts. Consider this a reminder to get your fill of them in the morning. While vegetables are often regulated to lunch and dinner, incorporating them into your breakfast along with an unprocessed protein source is a science-backed way to increase your lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Starting your morning by adding years to your life? Not too shabby of a way to start the day. Use it to set the tone and keep the longevity-supporting habits coming. With hope, you’ll be doing them for many, many years to come.&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/healthy-breakfasts-for-long-life_l_67004049e4b0c12c1d3bd133" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HuffPost.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilylaurence/healthy-breakfasts-for-long-life-sc?utm_source=yahoo-recirc-links" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read it on BuzzFeed.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Read it on BuzzFeed.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPazk5YWQ5NlpCblVydWNFWXdXUGkxNGxIOGxweFlqNTRnS18xRWpURmRoS2l6c2RrZS1jeWYyYU5VUnFaVzJMTXgxdmx1bHF2YXZtb0NnWEpuVWtoXzFPb3Z4dHk0OVEtSFZBVU5sR0h3dGhrMkdJcTVNV1lfNmoxa3EzeUptTlJpeVU4YUtPcw</guid></item><item><title>咖啡因袋：为什么青少年要尝试？ - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9YZ3dEMGRack1Ed2d2WHBnc05LTHZYd29aM0FqOXd4czZBS3cyN0dGUHFMenFYQzRFT0d3UmlncGV1NG9VVXY0XzZxa3dtQm9kR1ZVSEVybnVQd9IBX0FVX3lxTE1sdzU2VWpWSGtJY0NrVGFXdXItMmNJaWNaNm13WkpmcDdBajNCbi1WRWFOM0ZwMXFlUjZXLVNtbFRhMXhCQ21ZVmhnaHlCZ1JpLVJrRk1QTG5jdWc5dHg4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Caffeine pouch craze: A teenage trend troubling some experts&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Michelle Roberts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Digital health editor, BBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f7c3/live/8d4c0cf0-695a-11f0-8d79-5d14c6c2c854.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A pair of hands holding a can of pouches in one hand and a single pouch in the other.

Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors in your nerves, so your brain perceives less pain and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But it acts on other parts of the body too - including the cardiovascular system - which can be risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;High levels can cause a rapid heart rate, abnormal heart rhythms and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Although rare, there are documented deaths from excess caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others and can feel nauseous, anxious and irritable, and get headaches even at lower doses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Generally, up to 400mg of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.food.gov.uk/news-alerts/news/fsa-and-fss-issue-guidance-on-caffeine-in-food-supplements" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;caffeine a day &lt;/a&gt;appears to be safe for most healthy adults - that's around four cups of instant coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Tea contains a bit less, so five cups a day is usually fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Pregnant women are advised to halve daily intake to 200mg or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Children and teenagers are also more susceptible to the risks and potential for an overdose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This is why energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine, for example, are already required by EU law to carry labels stating: "High caffeine content.

A tiny &lt;strong&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/strong&gt; puppy gets the hiccups, and suddenly you’re weeping over how cute life can be.

If you’ve ever needed a reason to love Golden Retriever puppies even more, this is it.

Dogs aren’t like us. You can’t tell them to hold their breath or drink water from a cup backwards. And you &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; can’t jump-scare the hiccups out of them (please don’t try). The best thing to do is to help them calm down. Offer a gentle belly rub, some fresh water, distract them with a slow &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retrievers-life-lesson-during-daily-stroll-serves-as-an-important-reminder" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sniff walk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;sniff walk&lt;/a&gt;, or let them relax in their cozy spot.

Either way, the disease hijacks the instructions that tell our cells how to behave, turning helpful teammates into troublemakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, oncology has focused on destroying those unruly cells. A new line of work asks a different question: what if we could push them back to their earlier, well-behaved selves instead?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That shift in thinking matters because collateral damage from chemotherapy and radiation can leave patients exhausted, immunocompromised, or facing secondary health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-cells-create-power-waves-to-fuel-invasion/"&gt;malignant cells&lt;/a&gt; into harmless ones – rather than wiping them out – could soften side effects and open doors for people too frail for aggressive regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spotting-the-tipping-point"&gt;Spotting the tipping point&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before a tumor shows up on a scan, genetic and epigenetic tweaks accumulate inside would-be cancer cells. Eventually the balance tips, launching a rapid change known as a critical transition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physicists know a similar tipping point from the way water flashes into steam at 212 °F (100 °C). Biologists, though, have struggled to pin down that instant in living tissue because every cell moves at its own pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (&lt;a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;KAIST&lt;/a&gt;) recently reported a method that captures this fleeting window. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team at KAIST, led by Professor Kwang-Hyun Cho of the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering, calls its approach REVERT, short for REVERse Transition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to record each cell’s gene activity, reconstruct the internal circuitry, then simulate how the circuitry shifts as cancer sets in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revert-kills-cancer-with-math"&gt;REVERT kills cancer with math&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many computational &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/computer-model-can-identify-tumor-fighting-immune-cells/"&gt;cancer models&lt;/a&gt; rely on differential equations packed with hard-to-measure parameters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVERT keeps the math lean by translating gene networks into &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/boolean-logic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Boolean logic&lt;/a&gt;: every gene is either on or off, yes or no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That stripped-down map is surprisingly powerful. It lets the software explore all the stable states – called attractors – that a cell might occupy and rate each one with a malignancy score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low score reflects orderly growth signals. A high score flags a pattern more typical of tumors, such as constant division or resistance to suicide signals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By nudging one switch at a time in the computer, the investigators can ask which combinations shove a high score back down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pausing-a-rogue-gene-pair"&gt;Pausing a rogue gene pair&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/medicinal-plant-has-great-potential-to-fight-colorectal-cancer/"&gt;Colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; gave REVERT its first real-world test. The researchers fed the program single-cell RNA-sequencing data from patient biopsies, watched the simulated cells cross the transition, and searched for breakpoints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One culprit popped up quickly: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MYC&lt;/a&gt;, a gene famous for stepping on the gas in many cancers. Shutting off MYC alone, however, did not restore order. The malignancy score fell partway, then stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second gene, &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=YY1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;YY1&lt;/a&gt;, changed the picture. Treating MYC and YY1 as a toggle switch produced two stable outcomes. Tip the balance one way and the cell speeds toward malignancy; tip it the other and normal behavior resurfaces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have discovered a molecular switch that can revert the fate of cancer cells back to a normal state by capturing the moment of critical transition right before normal cells are changed into an irreversible cancerous state,” said Cho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-from-code-to-colon-organoids"&gt;From code to colon organoids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding candidate switches &lt;em&gt;in silico&lt;/em&gt; is useful, but genuine tissues decide whether a therapy will fly. The researchers collaborated with &lt;a href="https://en.snu.ac.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Seoul National University&lt;/a&gt;, which provided colon organoids grown from patient samples. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists reduced activity of USP7 – another REVERT-highlighted target – the organoids regained orderly architecture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells once eager to overgrow instead respected their neighbors’ space and lined up neatly. Those test-tube results hint that similar reversions could emerge in living patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In particular, this study has revealed in detail, at the genetic network level, what changes occur within cells behind the process of cancer development, which has been considered a mystery until now,” Cho explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that uncovering those hidden levers marks the first time anyone has shown that “an important clue that can revert the fate of tumorigenesis is hidden at this very critical moment of change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-using-revert-on-different-cancer-types"&gt;Using REVERT on different cancer types&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal tumors were the proving ground, yet the underlying logic of critical transitions spans many cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lung and breast malignancies, for example, also pass through mixed-identity stages where healthy and diseased programs overlap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because REVERT focuses on that limbo period rather than late-stage chaos, it may reveal intervention points earlier than traditional drug screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-cell_transcriptomics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Single-cell transcriptomics&lt;/a&gt; keeps improving in depth and speed, so feeding richer datasets into the Boolean engine should sharpen its predictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/crispr-used-to-remove-extra-chromosomes-in-down-syndrome-and-restore-cell-function/"&gt;CRISPR-based&lt;/a&gt; gene editing has grown precise enough to toggle multiple switches in living tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pair those tools and oncologists could one day customize reversion cocktails for each patient, sparing healthy organs the collateral hits of broad-spectrum treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cancer-revert-and-regenerative-meds"&gt;Cancer, REVERT, and regenerative meds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attractor landscape at the heart of REVERT does more than illuminate cancer. Stem-cell biologists routinely coax cells to choose fates during laboratory reprogramming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Errant transitions, however, can derail tissue-engineering projects. A map that catches switches before the wrong fork could refine protocols for growing heart muscle, insulin-producing pancreas cells, or even neurons for spinal-cord repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the new framework remains a laboratory concept. Clinical trials that target paired switches must prove safe and durable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tumors also mutate quickly, potentially rewiring the very circuits researchers aim to reset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, a strategy that persuades misbehaving cells to stand down – rather than carpet-bombing them – offers a fresh playbook in the long fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202412503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 23:38:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOeWN5TThxY05xaUJMbDR3VlZIblIwSmpwLVBwWEprRkRpRXoyNGhiS216VURYX0NId1NEcjRqaXhXR0xLSmNjS1l5eVAwbkFYMHJqdlZoTmJTS1Jha2NGYmVEeGJHSXl1UDZITnI2a0dSWWZTX0tNWFJGUmdodmlRc0daMF9EZGg5T2M2MjNCalBzMXRPVEo3M3M3MTJENXZXN3g3V3M1ZEZOaG1RcnpULTNvYnZyZw</guid></item><item><title>根据专家的说法，如果你想减肥，醒来后什么时候开始吃东西- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE9GZkNRN3puSUZWVHhXMU5pSS1DVTFkVlVfOGp2cldLQXlsZ09NMUFRUXpVSU1YMXoxQUhhS0xlSDNRTGItQmZVZWRyS3JhNmVCaF9rVXZ4VG1lTVJPNFBFd2QyMkNjQWFBUTBrRGpEXzFzeXROUVpnSA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/when-to-start-eating-after-waking-up-to-lose-weight" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exactly When To Start Eating After Waking up if You’re Trying To Lose Weight, According to Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Exactly When To Start Eating After Waking up if You’re Trying To Lose Weight, According to Experts&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://parade.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading information about &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-breakfast-for-memory-according-to-a-neuropsychologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:breakfast;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;breakfast&lt;/a&gt; can feel like watching a food fight.

"It depends on the person. While eating earlier in the day may have some health benefits, that doesn’t mean you need to eat immediately upon waking. I think it’s probably a good idea to eat something within a few hours of waking."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, she says it's OK to stretch the two-hour rule to three hours, such as eating at 10:30 a.m. after a 7:30 a.m. wake-up time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another plot twist, one weight loss doctor said it might not be necessary to eat breakfast at all, suggesting you pay more attention to your body than the clock or general advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If someone is not hungry in the morning, then no breakfast or a handful of nuts will work," says &lt;a href="https://www.drdecotiis.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; a medical weight loss doctor in New York City.

Experts share more tips to help you lose weight:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Meal frequency&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One study in the &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/jaha.122.026484" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Journal of the American Heart Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that meal frequency and size were more important to weight loss than the timing often recommended in intermittent fasting. However, experts stress that recommendations for the number of meals and snacks to eat daily need customization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The number of meals each day varies from person to person—whether someone is eating three meals a day only or snacking in between is OK," Dr. Ali says. "As long as they are eating the correct foods. Both methods are acceptable."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Practice tuning into your body instead. "The goal is to avoid getting overly hungry, which often leads to overeating or grabbing less healthy options," Dr. Dasgupta explains. "Spacing out meals also helps with digestion and keeps energy steady."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise and diet go hand in hand when you're trying to lose weight. "Adding exercise is important to help maintain the metabolism and preserve muscle." Dr. Ali shares. "The goal is to preserve muscle and burn fat. It is important to be consistent."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He suggests logging 30 minutes of physical activity every day, five times per week. You can break it up into "exercise snacks," or smaller intervals (such as a 10-minute brisk walk in the morning and a 20-minute cycle at night).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Get some rest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9031614/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Research suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; sleep deprivation can make it harder to lose and maintain weight. "Poor sleep doesn’t just make you tired, it increases hunger hormones and reduces fullness signals, leading to increased appetite, less impulse control and cravings, especially for high-fat, sugary foods," Dr. Corrado explains. "Sleep deprivation also &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/high-cortisol-signs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:raises cortisol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;raises cortisol&lt;/a&gt;, promoting fat storage around the abdomen and increasing stress levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Manage stress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of cortisol...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Managing stress and emotional well-being are crucial for healthy eating and weight management," Dr. Corrado explains. "Our emotions significantly influence health behaviors, including what and how much we eat, by triggering signals that affect appetite, metabolism and fat storage."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She adds that emotionally-driven eating and cravings for processed foods are common because they activate the brain's reward center, even if you're not actually hungry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recognizing emotional eating triggers and developing alternative coping strategies are key steps toward healthier habits," she reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granting yourself self-compassion during a weight loss journey can help in this regard. "It's important to protect your progress from shame, whether it comes from yourself or others, as negative self-talk can easily derail your efforts," Dr. Corrado says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. See a doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's not just a ton of noise about breakfast online. There's a lot of information about weight, and not all of it's accurate, effective or applicable to your specific healthy situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important for a person to see their doctor to facilitate their weight loss efforts," Dr. Ali says. "Underlying hormonal or medical conditions should be addressed.

&lt;p&gt;The doctors used a fine needle to draw out what was in the masses to try to understand what was going on. But all they got out was dead tissue debris and immune cells, which wasn't very helpful. Given the masses, blood clots, and spreading necrotic ulcer, the man was sent to surgery. The doctors surgically removed the ulcer and masses and closed off the clotted veins. They then had to use tissue from the man's thigh to reconstruct his neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jinxed ink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final diagnosis was necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis, which means that clumps of immune cells formed amid inflammation, his lymph nodes became inflamed and swollen, and there was also dead tissue. It's unclear exactly how it all happened, but the doctors had several hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A central theory is that he had an abnormal immune response to the tattoo—red organic dyes and heavy metals that can be found in some tattoo ink have been linked to this before. In one possible scenario, the abnormal immune response led to immune cell clumping, causing his lymph nodes to swell and press against his vasculature. This in turn slowed blood flow in his neck, causing cells to die.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that chronic inflammation from the tattoo caused the walls of his veins to start eroding, also leading to cell death. A biopsy showed necrosis in his jugular veins that supports this hypothesis. It's also possible that the inflammation response involved a variety of aberrant immune responses that spurred a hyper-coagulant state, meaning his blood formed clots more easily. Blood clots in his neck could have also led to a necrotic lesion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doctors can't say for sure what happened—or if it involved some sort of divine retribution—they say the case expands the possibilities of bad outcomes from tattoos and clinicians should be aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the man recovered from the ordeal after comprehensive support. He was likely advised to avoid tattoos—and possibly holy water.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prescriptions for weight loss drugs, including Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro, have &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12979695/ozempic-usage-american-states-weight-loss-drug-rates.html"&gt;surged more than 700 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the US among those who do not have diabetes, and who are prescribed the drug off label, from 21,000 prescriptions in 2019 to about 174,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, 1.9million Americans have been prescribed a weight loss drug since 2018, according to data analysis company Truveta, and more than 9.3million prescriptions for the medications have been issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While patients lose several pounds on the injections every month, the weight loss happens so rapidly that they are often left with loose skin as a result of the loss of fat and muscle volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For those in their 20s and 30s, plastic surgeons said their skin should still be able to bounce back, while sunken cheeks and hollow eyes should recover, but for older adults, they can be left with loose hanging skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To combat the loss, people turn to injectable substances used to restore volume, smooth wrinkles and enhance facial features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They typically last for around three months and cost around $500 to $1,200 per syringe. Fillers are minimally invasive and can be inserted during a single appointment, with patients able to return to normal life the same day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Adam Rubinstein, a plastic surgeon in Florida, added to this website: 'This has been a trend for a little while, and it is not so much some sort of side effect of Ozempic or Mounjaro or drugs like them, it is really just a normal consequence of weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, because so many people have had weight loss made easier by these medications, a lot more people are losing weight, losing weight everywhere and then seeking these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even after you lose 10 or 15lbs, you notice facial changes. Sometimes the amount of weight you lose can show up in your face.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), which tracks cosmetic and surgical procedures in the US, found that filler injections have more than doubled between 2017, when Ozempic was first approved, and 2024, the latest date available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally approved for type 2 diabetics, but it has been prescribed off-label by doctors to those who are looking to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its sister medication Wegovy, which uses the same active ingredient semaglutide, was approved in June 2021 for weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were around 6.2million filler injections carried out in the latest year, they found, compared to just 2.6million when the weight loss drugs were first approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bruno and Dr Rubinstein, a plastic surgeon in Florida, said that the 'bulk' of this increase was down to the surge in the use of weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they also said that over this period society has become more accepting of fillers and more people have been open about receiving injections, further raising demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;ASPS data also showed there had been a 32 percent surge in abdominoplasties, or tummy tucks, over the same period, from 129,000 to 170,000 annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scott Disick shocked the public when he emerged looking gaunt and malnourished in March last year, with images later emerging of weight loss drugs in his refrigerator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Above is a woman who lost 135lbs after using a GLP-1 medication.

It is difficult to treat, with patients often needing regular pain relief and joint replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a first-in-human trial of a novel therapy suggests doctors could soon relieve the pain for at least a year with a single injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists at the Mayo Clinic injected the knees of nine osteoarthritis patients with a genetically-altered benign virus that caused cells to make an anti-inflammation molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over 12 months, participants reported they had reduced pain and were better able to move their knee. There were no serious safety issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christopher Evans, a physical medicine expert who led the study, said: 'This could revolutionize the treatment of osteoarthritis. This study provides a highly promising, novel way to attack the disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was only a Phase 1 trial, the initial stage of testing for a new medical treatment, so more tests are needed to solidify dosage, frequency and pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the early results were heralded as promising, with doctors now hoping to be able to get the drug to patients within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nine participants in the early trial had no serious reactions to the treatment (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and is linked to wear and tear on joints caused by aging, repeated stress from a job or sport, obesity or previous injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is most common in the hands, knees, hips and spine, and tends to be diagnosed at around 50 years old. Patients are normally female, and may be overweight or have a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The repetitive stress on joints from overuse and injury can damage cartilage, while aging means cells are less able to repair the tissue, leading to the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors treat osteoarthritis with over-the-counter painkillers and lifestyle changes, and may also recommend a joint replacement in severe cases. Hyaluronic acid injections are also available, but these normally only last around six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Painkillers and injections only target the pain, while joint replacements are used to resolve the cause of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In osteoarthritis, joints affected by the condition typically contain high levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a molecule linked to high levels of inflammation, pain and cartilage loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Evans and his team have focused on reducing levels of this molecule by targeting it with the &lt;span&gt;molecule IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), which has been shown to reduce IL-1 levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adu9804"&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, scientists recruited participants who were suffering from osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robbie Williams revealed he was suffering from osteoarthritis in his back in 2016&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients were then injected three times in one of the knees with osteoarthritis with an altered virus carrying the IL-1Ra gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The gene entered cells in the knee, and caused them to start to make the anti-inflammatory molecule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests on blood and fluid found in the cavities of joints after the injection showed there were much lower levels of inflammation than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was only meant to test whether the treatment was safe to use in humans, but doctors said that participants also said the injections helped to ease their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only two minor safety events were reported, and both were effusions, or abnormal fluid accumulations, that increased pain but resolved with treatment. The treatment used was not specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't clear how long pain relief from the injections may last. It also wasn't clear whether it could be used to ease pain in other joints like the fingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Evans added: 'Any medications you inject into the affected joint will seep right back out in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As far as I know, gene therapy is the only reasonable way to overcome this pharmacologic barrier, and it's a huge barrier.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In similar early studies, Dr Evans and his team added the IL-1RA gene into a harmless virus called AAV and tested it in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In these models, they found that the virus successfully infiltrated the cells that make up the linings of joints and cartilage and caused the molecule to be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2015, the team then received approval to start testing the drug in humans, but regulatory hurdles meant it took another four years before this could begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists are now excited to offer their treatment to a wider group of participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;James Strole, the organizer of RAADfest, said that the two women spent several days in the hospital and are now recovering, and insisted that while it is 'not clear the people got sick as a result of treatment from Dr. Holtorf', he was 'anxious' for the incident to be 'deeply investigated' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Holtorf insisted that he was 'freaked out' by the reactions because the symptoms didn't make 'any sense', and said he had not seen such reactions in 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that it is hard to keep up with which peptide combinations are accepted and which are banned, saying there is 'so much gray area... people know they just get patients better.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;James Strole, the organizer of RAADfest, told ProPublica that the two women spent several days in the hospital and are now recovering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He maintained that it is 'not clear the people got sick as a result of treatment from Dr. Holtorf', but was 'anxious' for the incident to be 'deeply investigated.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added that RAADfest has not had anything similar occur in 10 years of running the conference, but this is the first year that Holtorf offered therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the hospitalizations at his event, Strole insisted that peptides are considered 'generally safe' and he takes them himself regularly, but for everyone at his events, 'the big concern is safety.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We look at who is doing the administering, whether it’s an injection or supplement.

              &lt;p&gt;A common sedative sometimes taken to get high is becoming deadlier. Research out this week finds that annual U.S. deaths caused by nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas or whippits, have significantly spiked over the past decade and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Mississippi and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign conducted the study, an analysis of mortality data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They found that yearly reported nitrous oxide deaths rose by roughly 500% between 2010 and 2023. Though the death toll from this drug is still low overall, the study indicates that recreational nitrous oxide use is becoming a bigger problem, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The “findings underscore a growing public health concern and the need for enhanced surveillance and prevention efforts,” they wrote in the paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836925"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas"&gt;Nitrous oxide gas&lt;/a&gt; is routinely used in medicine as a sedative and anesthetic (perhaps most notably at the dentist’s office). And it’s a common propellant with many uses, including in whipped cream. People also use it recreationally to induce euphoric, if short-lasting, effects. These users often get nitrous oxide from whipped cream canisters, giving rise to the drug’s common nickname of “whippets” or “whippits.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other studies have &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10550887.2020.1813361"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that nitrous oxide misuse in the U.S. has increased over time, but according to the authors, there’s still little we know about the deaths that this misuse is causing. Though the effects of nitrous oxide are typically short-lasting, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/nitrous-oxide-laughing-gas#:~:text=Some%20people%20use%20nitrous%20oxide%20recreationally%20to%20achieve%20a%20momentary%20euphoric%20high.%20But%20inhaling%20laughing%20gas%20more%20often%20than%20you%20need%20it%20can%20cause%20serious%20and%20potentially%20life%2Dthreatening%20health%20complications%20like%3A"&gt;misuse&lt;/a&gt; can lead to oxygen deprivation, low blood pressure, seizures, and even heart attacks. Chronic use also saps the body of vitamin B-12, which can cause paralysis and permanent neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined death certificate data sent to the CDC. In 2010, they uncovered 23 reported deaths associated with nitrous oxide poisoning among people between the ages of 15 and 74. By 2023, there were 156 such deaths—a fivefold jump. Annual nitrous oxide deaths continued to increase significantly until 2018 and have since plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the latest &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf"&gt;National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;, at least 13 million Americans have used nitrous oxide recreationally in their lifetime. But the growing popularity of consumer nitrous oxide products has likely driven a surge in recreational use, the researchers say. These products are commonly sold online or in stores as whipped cream chargers or similar culinary products with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/style/galaxy-gas-nitrous-oxide.html"&gt;colorful names&lt;/a&gt; like “Galaxy Gas.” People on social media outlets like TikTok have encouraged the use of these products as part of viral challenges, though TikTok and other platforms have recently taken action to stop these challenges from spreading (at least some teens may still be finding &lt;a href="https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2024/09/28/galaxy-gas--nitrous-oxide--tiktok"&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt; to see the posts, though).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study researchers say that more should be done to educate Americans, especially children, about the dangers of the drug when misused and to mitigate its harm however possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“This is not local to one area; it’s everywhere,” said study researcher Andrew Yockey, University of Mississippi assistant professor of public health, in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-07-nitrous-oxide-deaths-spike.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “And it absolutely deserves national surveillance. The numbers are still small right now, but they’re growing, and they’re growing fast.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has also spotted an increase in reported adverse events related to nitrous oxide. In March 2025, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/alerts-advisories-safety-information/fda-advises-consumers-not-inhale-nitrous-oxide-products"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a warning to the public to stop using these products recreationally, which it updated in June with more brands to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/video/embed/vi3271083033/"&gt;Sharks with frickin' lasers&lt;/a&gt; are tired news. Peacocks, apparently, are where it's truly at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Famous for their dazzling iridescence, peacock feathers are known to &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsfs.2018.0043"&gt;contain nanostructures&lt;/a&gt; that scatter light in ways that make their plumage shimmer in hues of blue and green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying a special dye to multiple areas on a peacock's tail, researchers from Florida Polytechnic University and Youngstown State University in the US went on the hunt for structures that may emit a very different signature glow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a mind-blowing first for the animal kingdom, they discovered the eyespots on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/female-animals-teach-each-other-to-choose-unusual-males-research-suggests"&gt;the fowl's fabulous feathers&lt;/a&gt; have unique properties that align light waves by bouncing them back and forth, effectively turning them into yellow-green lasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-emits-a-secret-light-that-scientists-are-trying-to-read?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Your Brain Emits a Secret Light That Scientists Are Trying to Read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word laser itself is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Shine a light on atoms in certain materials, such as certain dyes or crystals, and they'll collectively excite one another into releasing a flood of photons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of light amplification &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1566119918303963?via%3Dihub"&gt;isn't rare&lt;/a&gt; in nature, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep06736"&gt;attracting the attention&lt;/a&gt; of researchers who are interested in developing biological lasers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To become a bona fide laser beam, however, the buildup of stimulated waves must be neatly aligned so their phases march in step. One way to achieve this is to reflect the waves back and forth in a confined space known as an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_cavity"&gt;optical cavity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103608" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer.jpg" alt="laser coherency diagram" class="wp-image-103608 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/lasercoherency_explainer-600x450.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103608" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;What makes a laser's light so different? (ScienceAlert)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found evidence of optical cavities in the form of resonating nanostructures in different parts of the eyespot, all faintly emitting two different wavelengths: green and yellow/orange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly what kind of structure is responsible for aligning the amplified light at these colors isn't clear. But the fact they are found across the feather, all emitting the same precise wavelengths in a signature fashion, is a sign that something strange is at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying the physical properties of these resonators could lead to advances in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-laser-breakthrough-can-read-text-on-a-page-from-a-mile-away"&gt;laser technology&lt;/a&gt;, or provide biologists with a new tool for analyzing &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/living-material-made-from-blood-can-repair-bones-study-shows"&gt;living materials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the peacocks, we can only guess why evolution built lasers into their stunningly iridescent plumage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how biologists are quickly coming to terms with the way &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-shaved-roadkill-to-find-out-how-mammals-glow-in-the-dark"&gt;animals fluoresce&lt;/a&gt; and shine in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/most-birds-of-paradise-are-secretly-biofluorescent-study-finds"&gt;patterns and colors&lt;/a&gt; beyond our perception, it may be for displays that other peacocks are well adapted to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blue-sharks-may-be-secret-chameleons-scientists-discover"&gt;sharks with lasers&lt;/a&gt; aren't such a terrible idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04039-8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It was the same table where I’d sat through both of my pregnancies and where, three years earlier, I’d been diagnosed with breast cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m so sorry,” my doctor said. “I know how it feels to go through menopause. Especially since you went through it overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the one who diagnosed me with cancer. I’d found a small lump on my right breast and called her office immediately. Our appointment fell on Halloween 2017, and she was dressed up as Snow White, wearing full face paint and a black wig. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You are one of the lucky ones,” she said, as I sat on the table and cried. “You don’t need chemotherapy, and you’re going to be okay.” My doctor was right — I was lucky. I’d caught it early, and with breast cancer, early detection is everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My treatment consisted of a mastectomy, reconstruction surgery and 10 years of targeted hormone therapy — to kill the estrogen in my body and lower my risk of recurrent cancer. The goal of these hormone treatments — for pre-menopausal women — is to slingshot you through menopause. It worked. Within a matter of weeks, I went from being a healthy 37-year-old menstruating woman, to a hot-flashing, bone-aching, post-menopausal cancer survivor. I suffered vaginal irritation, something I’d later learn was vaginal atrophy. The only thing not atrophying were my post-operative breasts — they looked perkier than ever. But while my boobs felt 16 again, my vagina felt 61. It was a total mindfuck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It hurts,” I complained. “Just... all the time. And especially during sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause makes it very uncomfortable — nearly impossible — to have successful intercourse,” she said matter-of-factly. “Have you heard of vaginal rejuvenation? A colleague of mine, in Albuquerque, is offering laser treatment in her practice. I think you’d be a great candidate for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author taking a selfie during her first mammogram appointment. "I didn't know at that time what was ahead of me," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;An hour later I was home, googling laser vaginal rejuvenation. Eventually, I found a reputable women’s healthcare site with information on the treatment. Above the medical description, there was a photo of a smiling woman in her 60s, wearing a pink button up shirt. She had done the treatments and seemed to be enjoying “successful intercourse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of vaginal rejuvenation treatment I was considering, “gently rejuvenates” the vagina, by delivering a type of therapy known as fractional CO2 (carbon dioxide) laser energy to the soft tissues of the vaginal wall and providing a hormone-free treatment for vaginal atrophy. Vaginal atrophy — for those who have not yet journeyed into the Saharan desert of menopause — is next-level vaginal dryness. It’s a side effect of menopause — practically a guarantee. For many women and people with vaginas, vaginal estrogen creams can provide sufficient relief for the pain experienced during intercourse caused by vaginal atrophy. For women like me — who are proactively killing the estrogen inside their bodies with mega medications — the research remains ongoing about estrogen creams, rings and tablets, and whether they are safe to use. Right now, it’s not something I am comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was excited to discuss what I’d learned with my husband. In the throes of parenting two toddlers — while also recovering from a life-threatening illness — addressing sexual dysfunction was on our to-do list but hadn’t yet become a crisis in our marriage. Together we defined two major drawbacks to the treatment. The first was the price tag. The laser treatment consists of three sessions, distanced a few months apart. I was quoted $3,000 in total for the three sessions. Insurance does not cover the cost of vaginal rejuvenation, although you might be able to get reimbursed through a flexible spending account (FSA). I don’t have one of those. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second concern was the risk. Most of the websites I researched did not mention any risk involved with the treatment. But there is, of course, risk when you decide to have your vagina lasered. Some women have experienced excruciating pain during the treatment and — in very rare cases — suffered vaginal burns. Despite all that and because I was one of the lucky ones to have access to the treatment and could afford it, I decided to try it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband, Alex, at the Inn in Vermont where they got married. "This was on our 8th wedding anniversary," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I was taking in the desert mesas on my way to Albuquerque for my first laser treatment. When I arrived at the small gynecology practice, I was greeted by a young and chipper receptionist. I told her in a quiet voice that I was there for vaginal rejuvenation. She asked me to repeat myself. I did. She giggled nervously and asked me to wait. I watched her consult with a co-worker before returning to the window. “I’m sorry,” she said with amusement. “I hadn’t heard of that before.” I shot her a look that was meant to say, &lt;em&gt;menopause is coming for you too, young lady. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I was led to an examining room and given a gown. A nurse entered the room and applied a numbing cream to my labia. As I waited to go numb, I spotted the laser treatment in the corner of the room. It was a tall machine with a long, slender wand. It looked like something you might see at a dentist’s office. Then the gynecologist walked in — an older, soft-spoken, hippy-ish woman — and told me how excited she was to have the opportunity to perform the treatment. “Have you used the laser before?” I asked nervously. “Only a few times,” she responded. I tried to ignore the sudden wave of panic that washed over me. She turned on the machine and it made a loud, vibrating noise. As I laid back, a tagline from an old Virginia Slims commercial popped into my mind: &lt;em&gt;You’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial treatment went well. For a few days, I experienced some light vaginal bleeding, which was to be expected. The laser creates tiny micro-abrasions on the vaginal wall, increasing blood flow and stimulating the growth of new blood vessels — essentially bringing new life to your vagina. I didn’t feel any pain during the treatment, although it was a bit uncomfortable and awkward. After the first session, I noticed something right away. My vagina seemed happier. In fact, it didn’t hurt ― at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gynecologist told me to have sex in-between the sessions, to help maintain my new elasticity. I was feeling so bolstered from the positive results of the first treatment, I couldn’t wait to jump into bed with my husband. But when it came time to get down to business, I was extremely disappointed to find out penetration remained very painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m sorry,” I said to my husband, after we tried — unsuccessfully — to have sex. “I can’t do this, it hurts too much.” I was in tears. We both were frustrated. &lt;em&gt;Would I ever have sex again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author, her husband and two children on Halloween 2017, a few hours after her doctor diagnosed her with breast cancer. "We are trick-or-treating on Canyon Road in Santa Fe, New Mexico," she writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Anna Sullivan Reiser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I brought this question to my next appointment in Albuquerque. My gynecologist told me to wait to finish all three treatments before coming to any conclusions. But the results from the second treatment weren’t all that noteworthy. And the same was true for the third and final treatment. It seemed to me the major benefits of vaginal rejuvenation occurred after the first treatment. It had a very positive effect on the overall wellbeing of my vagina but didn’t fix the painful symptoms I was experiencing during intercourse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Six months after my initial doctor’s visit, I was back in the examining room detailing my experience. My doctor and I agreed that researching and devoting more funds to women’s health has a long way to go. Most women can’t afford expensive vaginal laser treatments, and instead, are learning to normalize their pain or simply avoid talking about it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Did vaginal rejuvenation fix the painful symptoms I experienced during sex? No. Do I feel comfortable using an estrogen cream? Again, no. But I think of the waiting room at the Dana Farber Cancer Center — and I guess I can live with it. The question is, why should I? Why is there a little blue pill for erections and not an effective medication for vaginal dryness? Yet again, it seems we have been given the shaft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before I left, my doctor wrote me a prescription for Lidocaine, a numbing cream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Put this on twenty minutes before sex, it really helps,” she said. Before she left the room she turned and gave me a half smile, as if to say, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;welcome to menopause, we’ve come a long way, baby. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;But have we? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are a few other non-estrogen vaginal atrophy treatments out there — and maybe someday I’ll try them. For now, my partner and I are exploring what “successful intercourse” means to us. Penetration is only one way of having sex — there are lots of fun things to do. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

It surrounds your organs, messes with your metabolism, and quietly raises your risk for things like heart disease, diabetes, and more. It’s called visceral fat, and the kicker is, you don’t have to look overweight to have too much of it. Spot reduction is not really an option, but certaian tweaks in the routine can help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, even slim folks can carry dangerous levels of visceral fat — a condition sometimes referred to as “skinny fat.” Unlike the soft layer just under your skin (subcutaneous fat), this kind hides out around your liver, kidneys, intestines, and heart, fueling inflammation and silently working against your health. Visceral fat increases the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and even Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 workouts to cut down that belly fat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to tell if you’ve got too much visceral fat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If visceral fat is about 10% of your body’s total fat mass, that’s normal and healthy, according to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24147-visceral-fat" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/living-with/healthy-weight.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Generally, if your waist measures more than 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men, it may be time to take notice. But don’t cheat the tape, breathe out naturally and wrap it just above your hip bones, right around your belly button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another hint is your muscle-to-fat ratio. If you’ve lost muscle and gained fat, especially as you age, that imbalance can mean more visceral fat inside, even if the scale doesn’t budge much. Tools like DEXA scans or smart body composition scales can offer more insight, but the everyday clues, low energy, weight gain around your midsection, or poor sleep, are often just as telling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chris Chappel, on his social media page, recently shared nine habits that can naturally shrink visceral fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid late-night eating&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating close to bedtime isn’t just about calories, it affects hormones like insulin, cortisol, and glucose, which all play a role in fat storage. Try shifting your biggest meals to earlier in the day and giving your body a few hours of fasting before bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Embrace the cold&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold exposure, like a quick 1–2 minute cold shower or using an ice pack a few times a week, can activate brown fat, which burns energy to produce heat. It’s not a miracle fix, but it can help reduce waistline over time when done consistently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Move more &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just about your workouts. Daily movement that isn’t “exercise”, like walking while on the phone, cleaning the house, or taking the stairs, actually burns a surprising amount of fat. It’s called NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis), and it adds up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Apple cider vinegar before meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a tablespoon of diluted apple cider vinegar about 10 minutes before meals has been shown to reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes. Stable blood sugar means less fat storage, particularly around the belly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep isn’t just rest, it’s a reset button for your hormones. Getting less than 6 hours a night over time is linked to significant increases in visceral fat. Aim for 7 to 9 hours, cut screen time before bed, and sleep in a cool, dark room. Right sleep environment is crucial for a good night's sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Add more soluble fiber&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fiber helps regulate blood sugar, supports gut health, and improves insulin sensitivity, all of which play a part in reducing belly fat. Some good sources: avocados, oats, flaxseeds, and Brussels sprouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rethink your cooking oils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly processed oils like canola, soybean, and corn oil can fuel inflammation, which plays a big role in fat gain. Instead, reach for olive oil, avocado oil, or even grass-fed butter in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lift weights &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training just two or three times a week can lower visceral fat, even if your weight doesn’t drop. Building muscle improves insulin sensitivity, which helps your body manage fat storage more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Start your day with protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping protein in the morning is a missed opportunity. A breakfast with 30–40 grams of protein helps reduce hunger later in the day and keeps blood sugar levels steady. Try eggs, Greek yogurt, a protein shake, or lean meats like turkey sausage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With consistent effort and mindful habits, shrinking visceral fat is not only possible — it’s one of the best investments you can make in your long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

Eight have died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infection, called Vibrio vulnificus, is one of a dozen species of Vibrio: a bacteria found in coastal waters when the weather is warm and in raw shellfish, especially oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana Department of Health said Thursday morning that it is seeing a higher number of cases and deaths than typically reported. So far this year, there have been 17 cases and four deaths in the state. Seventy-five percent reported seawater exposure as the cause.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;This is a noticeable spike compared to previous years. Between 2013 and 2023, there was an average of &lt;a href="https://lsbme.la.gov/severe-vibrio-vulnificus-infections-in-the-united-states-associated-with-warming-coastal-waters" target="_blank"&gt;13 cases per year&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="2"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen cases and four deaths have been reported to the Florida Department of Health. The state has been a hot spot for Vibrio vulnificus infections in prior years. In 2022, 74 people were infected and 17 died — "an abnormal increase in cases," the department said at the time. Many were linked to Hurricane Ian, which brought bacteria-laden floodwater into homes.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Both Mississippi and Alabama have had only one recorded case. Neither were deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that 1 in 5 people who become infected die, while many survivors undergo limb amputations. Symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, fever and chills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    
    &lt;div class="row text-row" data-breakout="3"&gt;&lt;div class="col-md-8"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with open wounds should be cautious when swimming in brackish or warm coastal waters. Some Vibrio vulnificus infections lead to necrotizing fasciitis — a severe bacterial infection that kills the flesh around an open wound, which is why it is called a "flesh-eating" bacteria, health officials said. People with weakened immune systems should also be careful when eating or handling raw seafood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;After spending months without eating, drinking, or moving, hibernating mammals must rebound from extreme physiological changes. Two new studies suggest that the genetic “superpowers” underlying this incredible resilience may also be present in the human genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For these studies, published Thursday, July 31, in the &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966582"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D51090245318916360690338922894760961130%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1753966595"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, researchers at the University of Utah honed in on the specific DNA regions that help hibernators rapidly recover from muscle atrophy, insulin resistance, and brain damage. They found strong evidence to suggest that the human genome shares these genetic regions, which function as control switches for hibernator adaptations. Finding and harnessing them could lead to new treatments for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and other disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Humans already have the genetic framework,” said Susan Steinwand, a neurobiology and anatomy researcher at U of U Health and first author of one of the studies. “We just need to identify the control switches for these hibernator traits.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;During hibernation, mammals enter a state of torpor, or physiological dormancy. This allows them to survive months without food and water, but at great cost to their health. Their muscles deteriorate due to lack of nutrition and movement, Christopher Gregg, a professor of neurobiology at U of U and senior author on both studies, told Gizmodo. Proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease build up in their brains, and upon awakening, the sudden reperfusion of blood can cause further neurological damage, he explained. What’s more, they become insulin resistant due to the amount of fat they gain to sustain them during months of starvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals have evolved remarkable adaptations to reverse this extensive physiological damage. The genes that underlie these adaptations are likely also present in humans and other non-hibernators, Gregg explained. The fact that hibernation has evolved independently in multiple animal species suggests that its basic genetic ingredients are present across the mammalian genome. Therefore, non-hibernators may still carry them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We mostly all have the same genes across species,” Gregg said. “The big change is in the 98% of the genome that does not encode for genes.” Non-coding DNA is largely responsible for gene regulation. In hibernators, specific regions of non-coding DNA act as “master switches” for controlling functional gene responses to starvation and refeeding, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Finding these master switches in the mammalian genome is like searching for needles in a DNA haystack. To accomplish this, the researchers made whole-genome comparisons across mammals to identify conserved DNA regions that are stable in most species but show accelerated change in hibernators. These hibernator-accelerated regions are regulators that turn genes on in specific cells at specific times, Elliott Ferris, a data analyst in Gregg’s lab at U of U and first author of one of the studies, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand the biological processes that may be linked to these hibernator-accelerated regions, the researchers identified genes that get turned up or turned down during fasting in mice. Hibernation is an adaptation to survive food scarcity, so fasting triggers similar metabolic changes. This led them to “hub genes” that act as master regulators for fasting-induced changes to gene activity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The really surprising discovery that was very exciting was that the hibernation-linked elements are disproportionately affecting those key hub genes,” Gregg explained. “The implication is that hibernators changed the regulation and activity of these core hub genes to have big downstream effects on the whole program for responding to food scarcity and food deprivation. That’s important as we think about translating this knowledge into the real world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gregg is co-founder of Primordial AI, a Utah-based biotech startup that leverages AI to uncover master regulator gene drug targets. Through this company, he aims to develop drugs that mimic the genetic advantages hibernators have, such as boosting neuroprotection in Alzheimer’s patients or reversing insulin resistance in type 2 diabetics. “Those hub genes are the ones that we think are a really good starting point to design medicines to affect those genes,” Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;

However, one family physician sees patients who are often surprised that their weight increased—or at least their efforts to lose it stalled—after they also upped their &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/number-one-healthiest-fruit-according-to-registered-dietitians" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fruit intake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fruit intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruit can satisfy that sweet tooth, hopefully helping you avoid the less healthy refined sugar," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://familydoctor.org/media_ambassadors/dr-mike-sevilla-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mike Sevilla, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mike Sevilla, MD&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;a family physician. "On the other hand, I have a lot of patients who have incorporated fruit in their diets, but are not achieving weight loss."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's frustrating to follow advice and not see results. However, Dr. Sevilla often asks questions about &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;his patients consume fruit. Their answers frequently reveal they're making a common but sneaky mistake with it. The good news? Fixing it isn't complicated and can be downright delicious. Dr. Sevilla and other doctors share the one thing they're begging people attempting to lose weight to stop doing with fruit, why and what to do instead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺 &lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/healthy-now" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;SIGN UP for tips to stay healthy &amp;amp; fit with the top moves, clean eats, health trends &amp;amp; more delivered right to your inbox twice a week&lt;/a&gt; 💊&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;The No. 1 Fruit Mistake To Avoid When You're Trying To Lose Weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After talking to patients struggling to lose weight, Dr. Sevilla learns that some of them are using fruit juices. "I prefer my patients to use whole fruit for health benefits," he says. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2813987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; by Harvard researchers suggested that a tall glass of 100% fruit juice daily could contribute to &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/habits-of-people-who-never-gain-weight-according-to-experts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight gain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;weight gain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, seeing "100% fruit juice" on a container in the grocery store can seem promising and healthy. Speaking of which, when you look at the front of a fruit juice label, you may see phrases like "Excellent source of &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1142998/shameikarhymes/vitamin-c-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin C;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;." That's not just clever marketing—it's true. Doctors aren't denying that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Some of the benefits of fruit, such as vitamins, can still be there in juice form," says&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mir Ali, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mir Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, it's important to read the &lt;em&gt;entire &lt;/em&gt;nutrition label for fruit juice to see what else is in it (and what's not) that could stifle weight loss efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/weekly-walking-workout-plan-for-weight-loss-according-to-trainers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Personal Trainers Share Exactly What a Week of Walking Should Look Like if You Want To Lose Weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Personal Trainers Share Exactly What a Week of Walking Should Look Like if You Want To Lose Weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Fruit juices are low in fiber, which does not satisfy hunger, and can cause people to drink more juice and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-habit-for-blood-sugar" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:spike their blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;spike their blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and insulin levels," explains Dr. Sevilla. "In addition, the amount of calories in fruit juices is higher and more concentrated than in whole fruit."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These risks also apply to recipes one weight loss doctor often sees incorporated into "juice cleanses," which, ironically, can have the opposite effect on your goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"'Juicing' juice cleanses can hinder weight loss because they have too much sugar and not enough fiber to slow absorption of fruit sugar," explains &lt;a href="https://www.drdecotiis.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sue Decotiis, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a medical weight loss doctor in New York City.

They may gravitate toward juices with added sugar (and not fiber) instead. Additionally, it's essential to be mindful of whole fruit intake when trying to lose weight. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doctors share these tips to help you eat foods that nourish your body and support your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;1. Learn to enjoy whole fruit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients constantly ask Dr. Sevilla how to make whole fruit more enjoyable. For instance, there are numerous ways to enjoy fruit without making it the star of the plate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Add fruit to some of your favorite dishes, which helps add a welcoming sweet taste to your meal," he recommends. "[One] example is to toss diced apples or pears into a salad with walnuts and feta. At breakfast, you can try mixing berries into cottage cheese or low-sugar Greek yogurt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;2. Balance nutrients regardless of your fruit's form&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Sevilla's meal suggestions are balanced—for instance, cottage cheese and Greek yogurt have protein, and apples are a good source of fiber. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Decotiis says that's important. In fact, she advises people trying to lose weight to be mindful of how much fruit they consume—even in whole form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruit contains important vitamins, minerals and fibers, but also fructose, which is a form of sugar," she points out. "While eating fruit is healthier than eating sucrose found in sweets, it is still sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Therefore, a balance of nutrients is key, with fiber and protein playing vital roles. Without fiber? It doesn't matter if the fruit was in whole or juice form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Sugar will be absorbed quickly, resulting in a spike in insulin," Dr. Decotiis notes. "We could see a rapid drop in blood sugar or glucose that could trigger hunger and cravings between meals. Eating fruit with protein or having the fruit with a meal can help avoid swings in blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;3. Load up on vegetables&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Vegetables have less sugar, much more fiber on average and many—if not more—nutrients," Dr. Decotiis explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1316162/michelle-polizzi/high-fiber-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fiber is filling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fiber is filling&lt;/a&gt;, helps control hunger and boosts gut health while also keeping you regular (pooping)—all of which can help you lose weight at a healthy pace. So, you may not need to load up on fruit if you're consuming lots of vegetables daily.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"If vegetables are consumed in adequate amounts, only one fruit a day is really necessary," she says. "Fruits with higher fiber grams are apples [and] &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-if-you-eat-avocados-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avocado;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;—yes, it’s a fruit, not a veggie."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr. Ali also notes that consuming fruits on the lower end of the glycemic index can help lower the odds of experiencing blood sugar fluctuations that can make weight loss more challenging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Fruits like berries and citrus fruits have a lower glycemic index and tend to cause less sugar spikes," he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-happens-if-you-eat-bananas-every-day" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Here's What Happens to Your Body if You Eat Bananas Every Day;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Here's What Happens to Your Body if You Eat Bananas Every Day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Consumption of 100% Fruit Juice and Body Weight in Children and Adults. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2813987" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Pediatrics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mir Ali, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Mir Ali, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/what-not-to-do-with-fruit-when-trying-to-lose-weight-according-to-doctors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Doctors Are Begging People Trying To Lose Weight To Stop Doing This One Thing With Fruit;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Doctors Are Begging People Trying To Lose Weight To Stop Doing This One Thing With Fruit&lt;/a&gt;

experts say this year is the worst tick &lt;/a&gt;season on record due to a milder winter across the US, which allowed more ticks and their animal hosts to survive the winter months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A Maine resident has been hospitalized with the year's first human case of the tick-borne Powassan virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Powassan virus human disease cases reported by area of residence from 2004 to 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In line with other tick-borne diseases, human cases of Powassan virus have steadily risen over the past decade in the US, a trend some say is linked to &lt;a href="/news/climate_change_global_warming/index.html" id="mol-6f08b9b0-da13-11ed-b0f8-8f0644773167" target="_self" class=""&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; and clearing more land for development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infections are increasing across the midwest and northeast and are most common in the summer months when ticks are active. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following the Powassan virus case in Maine, the CDC is warning residents and visitors to the state to take care in areas ticks might be present to prevent themselves from getting bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Powassan virus is named for the city it was discovered in, Powassan, Ontario, where it was discovered in a young boy in 1958.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A person will often feel symptoms of the virus somewhere between a week and a month after the tick bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Along with other tick-borne disease, human cases of Powassan virus have steadily increasing over the past decade in the US, a trend some say is linked to climate change and clearing more land for development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial symptoms can include fever, headache, vomiting, and generalized weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease can then spread to the brain and cause inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When it reaches this stage some of the more severe symptoms include an altered mental status, seizures, speech problems (aphasia, dysarthria), paralysis, and movement disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Maine resident was reported to have suffered severe neurological symptoms as a result of their infection. They are currently receiving treatment for their infection in a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC reports that a majority of people that are infected with the virus are asymptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The government agency has reported 397 cases of the virus since 2004 and 50 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, cases have been steadily increasing year over year, with the highest number of patients in 2024 at 57.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of the Powassan virus are extremely rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Maine, less than 20 have been reported over the last 12 years, though the prevalence of asymptomatic infections means the figure is likely an undercount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, the most common tick-borne disease is Lyme disease with more than 470,000 new cases but only a small fraction of these cases result in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While Lyme disease is the most prevalent, there are at least 20 other tick-borne diseases in the US, including anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ticks aren't the only threat, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquito-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and dengue fever are also becoming more prevalent due to the rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile virus is currently the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the US. Just this week, mosquito samples from two cities in Ohio tested positive for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far this year, there have been 98 human cases of West Nile virus in the US, including 53 severe or 'neuroinvasive' cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the US declared dengue outbreaks in 2024 that have continued into 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local transmission of dengue was reported last year in California, Florida, and Texas. Florida has reported local dengue transmission in 2025 with four confirmed cases of 'locally acquired' dengue found in Brevard County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far in 2025, there have been 2,553 cases of dengue fever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;They're called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW2eGaUzq7E" target="_blank"&gt;Demodex&lt;/a&gt;, and they feast on the greasy oil (sebum) in your pores! These microscopic 8-legged arachnids are related to ticks and spiders. They don't have an anus or eyes. It's more than likely that you have dozens of them on you at this very minute. They spend most of their time near your hair follicles. They "crawl out to the surface and mate, before crawling back into your pores to lay their eggs." It's impossible to truly rid your body of all of them, so don't waste your time trying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But how old is your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most U.S. adults have a “heart age” that’s older than they are, often by quite a bit, based on wear and tear, heart disease and lifestyle, according to research led by Northwestern Medicine. The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836740" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/article-abstract/2836740"&gt;JAMA Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Northwestern University has created a free online tool that calculates how your heart compares to your chronological age and risk for heart disease, using health data like cholesterol levels, smoking status, blood pressure and whether you have diabetes. They make a point, however, of noting it’s not intended to replace doctor visits and that you should use it in consultation with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Calculating-heart-disease-risk" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Calculating heart disease risk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Heart disease risk has typically been presented as a percentage, according to a news release from Northwestern. “For example, a health care clinician may tell a patient, ‘eight out of 100 people with your profile may have a heart event in the next 10 years.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The calculator is based on the American Heart Association’s prediction tool called PREVENT, which stands for “Predicting Risk of cardiovascular EVENTs.” Updated in 2023 and findings published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001191" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001191"&gt;Circulation&lt;/a&gt;, the tool has been hailed for its “race-free” approach and ability to indicate risk for cardiovascular disease and events, thus hopefully heading both off, per a &lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2023/11/17/predicting-the-risk-of-heart-disease-10-years-younger-than-before/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2023/11/17/predicting-the-risk-of-heart-disease-10-years-younger-than-before/"&gt;different Northwestern Medicine article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The new calculator doesn’t offer a risk percentage, but rather an age, which could be easier for the average patient to understand, its developers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We hope this tool helps doctors and patients discuss risk for heart disease more effectively so we can better inform what therapies can prevent heart attacks, stroke or heart failure events from ever happening,” senior author &lt;a href="https://www.preventivemedicine.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=25223" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;Dr. Sadiya Khan&lt;/a&gt;, professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who led development of the PREVENT equations, said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Developing-a-tool" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Developing a tool&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers tested the age calculator on more than 14,000 nationally representative U.S. adults between the ages of 30 and 79. They were all participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2011 and 2020. None of them had a history of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Northwestern noted that the women had an average heart age of 55.4 compared to the chronological age of 51.3. The gap was wider for men, who had an average heart age of 56.7 compared to the average chronological age of 49.7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The gap was bigger based on educational attainment and by race. Men who had graduated from high school or less had a heart age a decade older than their actual age. The hearts of Black men were, on average, 8.5 years older than the actual age. Hispanic men’s hearts were 7.9 years older, Asian men’s hearts were 6.7 years older and white men had hearts that were 6.4 years older than their actual age. All of those are on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among women, the gaps were 6.2 years older for Black women, 4.8 years older for Hispanic women, 3.7 years older for white women and 2.8 years older for Asian women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/30/heart-biological-age-cardiovascular-disease/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/07/30/heart-biological-age-cardiovascular-disease/"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; noted that “the calculator is at the vanguard of '&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/11/25/longevity-organ-aging-disease/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;organ aging’ tests&lt;/a&gt;, which use a variety of advanced techniques and algorithms to determine whether certain parts of our bodies are aging faster or slower than others. Most of these tests are still in early development. The heart-age calculator is one of the first to be widely available and free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Heart-disease-and-young-adults" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Heart disease and young adults&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Prevention of heart disease is key, the researchers said, and it should start at young ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The important thing is that we have very good options available in our toolbox to help slow that aging down if we can identify it. This may be even more important in younger people who don’t often think about their risk for heart disease,” Khan added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and has been for decades. Khan said that’s because many people who would benefit from prevention tools like medications to lower the risk of heart attack or stroke are not on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Khan said researchers plan to study whether presenting risk with the new calculator bolsters prevention efforts and understanding. They also hope the tool will spark needed conversations about heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Khan told the Post that a year or two difference in actual age and heart age probably doesn’t mean much, but people whose hearts clock in at five or 10 years older should be paying attention and doing something about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Martha Gulati, director of preventive cardiology and associate director of the Barbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, told the Post the calculation leaves out some heart risk factors for women, including menopausal changes and pregnancy complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Others point out that exercise and aerobic fitness matter to heart health, too, and are not included in the calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/10.1001/jamacardio.2025.2404?guestAccessKey=89b47187-85c1-42da-bfc9-031b4bb0500e&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=073025" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; in the journal that featured the new study, Drs. Mohammad Al Mouslmani, Abdulla Damluji, and Michael Nanna wrote that a calculator could have good or not-so-good effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“While a higher biological age may motivate some individuals to adopt healthier behaviors, others may find such information demoralizing or overwhelming, especially those with fewer resources or competing life demands. Public health messaging and clinician communication should be sensitive to these dynamics, ensuring that risk age is framed not as a verdict, but as an opportunity for change, supported by accessible interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;If you check out the &lt;a href="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://nwkhanlab.shinyapps.io/riskage/"&gt;new online heart age tool&lt;/a&gt;, you need to know some basic numbers, like your total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, blood pressure and estimated glomerular filtration rate, which looks at kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 17:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxNb2x5RGNPcU9Fcl9pMDlwdlNMM3FjZnFZQ3A5MXZPRktNV2VNbGNPTzhZa3d1UmNmSTJQSDFnclpWRFZ3ZmplVm9WcjZBSlluaHVXNFl1R3hQTXp0ZDNRSzNsQ2xHTzhkelk2NHFMdE5HU01PQkxUbWZ3TFduLVplMHFGSUtWNkJWQm50Rks1Q0F0Y0tJalh3RXc2ZHNOVzhLTWxnZDctRkdOVU85</guid></item></channel></rss>
