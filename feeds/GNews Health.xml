Bodybuilders on Reddit claim to guzzle it to bulk up. Jennifer Lopez credits it for her radiant skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Silicon Valley biohacker freak Bryan Johnson, who drinks several tablespoons with breakfast, sells his own brand of olive oil as part of an unproven longevity diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Influencers also claim the golden liquid has all sorts of benefits like alleviating bloating and constipation, helping your body absorb nutrients better, supporting your hair and skin health, and even treating hangovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But other experts have previously suggested there may be a link between olive oil and weight gain, as well as an increased risk of heart disease.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New York dietitian Michelle Routhenstein had a client who would consume a whole cup of the stuff each day, 'believing it to be exceptionally healthy,' &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/wellness-us/nutrition/article-12975709/How-olive-oil-making-FAT-UNHEALTHY-despite-touted-Mediterranean-superfood-according-dieticians.html"&gt;she told MailOnline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, this extreme behavior not only hindered his weight loss efforts but also adversely affected his cholesterol levels, as such high volumes of olive oil can be high in saturated fat, counteracting its purported benefits,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Excessive consumption of olive oil without portion control can lead to an imbalance in energy intake, potentially contributing to positive energy balance and subsequent weight gain or difficulty in achieving weight loss goals.'   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietitian Veronica Rouse added: 'It's important to be careful when listening to influencers who may sometimes unintentionally contribute to this overemphasis due to their personal experiences or endorsements, not always backed by an understanding of nutrition science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's crucial to discuss any change in your nutrition plan with your health care team or registered dietitian.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 14:23:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么蝙蝠不会得癌症-这对人类意味着什么- Gizmodo | Why Bats Don’t Get Cancer—and What That Means for Humans - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNX0g1M2hxaFA5OTVxcnA1OUx1WDBaMU5VMFBMNWRSNUsyX1ExNGVlSU56NnBpeEZoRmFsSnU2N094cTZBYnNYdk05VE82ei1ucHlTR080SFc0ek9Na1kwWFBScnF6MElSa3VSLTR0OW5qQWdld21BOGxhSkVha1ZtUnlEUTZjOUxsWkplR2preGFHTWctQzNJc2gyUGpUZEVteG1F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;When you think of longevity in animals, chances are that the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-400-year-old-shark-may-hold-the-cure-to-aging-1785144189"&gt;Greenland shark&lt;/a&gt; will immediately come up. After all, researchers &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/greenland-shark.html"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that the enigmatic animal can live for &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; 250 years. It turns out, however, that bats also hold their own when it comes to lifespan, with some species living up to 25 years—equivalent to 180 human years—and they tend to do it cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Rochester (UR) have investigated anti-cancer “superpowers,” as described in a UR &lt;a href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/why-dont-bats-get-cancer"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, in four bat species: the little brown bat, the big brown bat, the cave nectar bat, and the Jamaican fruit bat. The results of their investigation could have important implications for treating cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Longer lifespans with more cell divisions, and longer exposure to exo- [external] and endogenous [internal] stressors increase cancer incidence,” the researchers wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59403-z"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the journal Nature Communications. “However, despite their exceptional lifespans, few to no tumors have been reported in long-lived wild and captive populations of bats.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Led by biologists Vera Gorbunova and Andrei Seluanov from the UR Department of Biology and Wilmot Cancer Institute, the team identified a number of biological defenses that help bats avoid the disease. For example, bats have a tumor-suppressor gene, called p53. Specifically, little brown bats carry two copies of the gene, and have high p53 activity, which can get rid of cancer cells during &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/apoptosis#:~:text=Apoptosis%20is%20the%20process%20of,a%20role%20in%20preventing%20cancer."&gt;apoptosis,&lt;/a&gt; a biological process that eliminates unwanted cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We hypothesize that some bat species have evolved enhanced p53 activity as an additional anti-cancer strategy, similar to elephants,” the researchers explained. Too much p53, though, runs the risk of killing too many cells. Clearly, bats are able to find the right apoptosis balance. Humans also have p53, but mutations in the gene—which disrupt its anti-cancer properties—exist in around 50% of human cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also analyzed the enzyme telomerase. In bats, the telomerase expression allows bat cells to multiply endlessly. That means they don’t undergo replicative senescence: a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959804996000585"&gt;feature&lt;/a&gt; that restricts cell proliferation to a certain number of divisions. Since, according to the study, senescence “promotes age-related inflammation contributing to the aging process,” bats’ lack thereof would seem to promote longevity. And while indefinite cell proliferation might sound like the perfect cancer hotbed, bats’ high p53 activity can kill off any cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, “bats have unique immune systems which allows them to survive a wide range of deadly viruses, and many unique immune adaptations have been described in bats,” the researchers wrote. “Most knowledge of the bat immune systems comes from studies of bat tolerance to viral infections deadly to humans. However, these or similar immune adaptations may also recognize and eliminate tumors,” as well as “temper inflammation, which may have an anticancer effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cells have to go through several steps, or “oncogenic hits,” to become harmful cancerous cells. Surprisingly, the researchers also found that it only takes two hits for normal bat cells to become malignant, meaning bats aren’t naturally resistant to cancer—they just have “robust tumor-suppressor mechanisms,” as described in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings carry important implications for treating cancer. Specifically, the study confirms that increased p53 activity—which is already targeted by some anti-cancer drugs—can eliminate or slow cancer growth. More broadly, their research is yet another example of scientists turning to nature for solutions to human &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-tiny-robot-is-part-bee-part-crane-fly-and-it-finally-has-solid-legs-2000591586"&gt;challenges on all scales&lt;/a&gt;. Though the study focuses on bats, the ultimate aim is, always, finding a cure for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio — Global Fatty Liver Day is observed on June 12, and there is a growing effort to raise awareness on what is described as one of the most underdiagnosed and misunderstood health threats: fatty liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once considered a niche concern, it is now a growing global epidemic affecting more than one in four adults worldwide, according to recent estimates by the Global Liver Institute.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They looked at the biopsy, they ran several other tests, and that's when he said there is no cure,” Pam Miller said that is what doctors told her when she was diagnosed in 2001.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have approximately six years to live. Hopefully, they'll have a cure by then.”  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller’s fatty liver disease was at Stage Four, and there is no cure. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research has led to approved medications specifically for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH], and several promising drugs are now in late-stage trials, offering hope to millions.  &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller shared that she participates in clinical trials at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I'm helping my children and my grandchildren and everybody to come,” she said. “They watch you really closely, and so I'm thankful for all my doctors and stuff that have kept me here.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver disease, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD], often flies under the radar. Many people with NAFLD have no symptoms—until the condition advances to its more severe form, NASH, which can lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis or even liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical experts advise that fatty liver disease is preventable. Risk factors include obesity, insulin resistance, high cholesterol, and sedentary lifestyles, all of which are on the rise globally. But the lack of public awareness, routine screening, and even medical training around NAFLD has created a gap in both prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the statistics are sobering, experts remain hopeful. Fatty liver disease, particularly in its early stages, is reversible. A combination of modest weight loss, healthy eating, and regular physical activity can significantly improve liver health, sometimes in just a few months.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

            “We are deeply concerned about the recently adopted HHS policy to no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy,” wrote the organizations – including major professional groups for obstetricians, primary care providers, pediatricians, pharmacists and nurses – in an &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/06/open-letter-urging-covid-19-vaccination-coverage-in-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt;. “It is vital that we ensure that pregnant women continue to have access to this prevention tool so that they can protect themselves and their young infants, a vulnerable group who is not yet eligible for vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsd1wn600043b6mvytypov3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter calls on “payers and insurers to continue making the COVID-19 vaccine available to pregnant people without undue utilization management or cost-sharing requirements,” even though the shots have been &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/children-covid-vaccine-cdc"&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt; from the list of vaccines recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdl8q0000u3b6mowt6zqwb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant women who have Covid-19 are more likely to require care in the ICU or on a ventilator, or to die, the letter said, and they’re at higher risk of complications such as cesarean birth, preeclampsia or eclampsia, and blood clots. Infants born after a Covid-19 infection also face increased risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl84cg300033b6mbkyz85t7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The letter comes two weeks after US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly announced that the Covid-19 vaccine, which has shown to be safe and effective during pregnancy, would no longer be recommended for pregnant people. Leaders from the US Food and Drug Administration also recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/20/health/covid-vaccine-fda-changes"&gt;outlined a new framework&lt;/a&gt; for the approval process for Covid-19 vaccines that could limit shots to older Americans and people at higher risk of serious Covid-19 infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbpcp37q00093b6mkqoefzuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts immediately warned that these changes could create new barriers to vaccines for those who want them, including confusion around who is eligible and higher costs for patients if insurance no longer covers them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsd53se000a3b6mfly4ftvi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Pharmacists Association, which signed on to the open letter, said it has already received reports of patients being denied Covid-19 vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsaea0a00013b6mstltfjh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Leigh Haldeman, 33, a nurse at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle who is pregnant, told CNN that she tried twice to get vaccinated last week and was turned away.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700023b6mbddydesb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Because of some complications I had during my first pregnancy, getting the vaccine now and getting that extra boost of immunity would be definitely important for me,” said Haldeman, who got her last shot in the fall of 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700033b6mxthdq0su@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At two different pharmacies, she was told it is not recommended for pregnant women to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, based on new guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdm1jf000z3b6m8gg8w3ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She still hasn’t been able to get the shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdi047000o3b6m7lj8nde5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors still strongly recommend Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdi6of000r3b6moejwt88y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed,” the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement. “It is very clear that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants after birth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsdola800153b6mr7a7auym@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After an appointment last week, Haldeman agreed with her obstetrician’s advice to get an additional Covid-19 shot during her pregnancy. Her first try was a Walgreens store where she had an appointment to get the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700053b6mafo0n2v5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I went through the whole check-in process, and then as soon as the pharmacist saw that I was pregnant, they were like, ‘We cannot give this to you,’ ” she recounted. “ ‘We’re only giving it to immunocompromised people right now.’ ”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700063b6mvqvbp203@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she asked whether she was considered immunocompromised because she’s pregnant. Haldeman said the pharmacist responded that guidelines have changed, that it’s not recommended and they wouldn’t give it to her.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblbowqg00233b6m3ewml3p2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She then called her primary care provider and obstetrician, but neither had the vaccine in stock. In past years, pharmacies have administered the majority of Covid-19 shots.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700083b6mi0ylrw17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A Walgreens spokesperson told CNN, “We continue to closely monitor and review all federal and state guidance related to vaccines. As regulations and recommendations evolve, we remain committed to ensuring our pharmacy teams have the latest information to support patient care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha700093b6maymyx5kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Haldeman said her obstetrician suggested trying another pharmacy. She called a Safeway and asked, “I’m 25 weeks pregnant. My provider is recommending that I get this Covid booster. Are you able to give that to me?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000b3b6mmlz4qb3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The immediate answer was no.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000c3b6mv455mlpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m under the impression from my provider that I need to get this,” she recalled saying. “Pharmacies are the only people that appear to have it right now. What do I need to do to get this vaccine?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsec9m4001d3b6m7m2s3j23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said the pharmacist told her, “The guidelines have changed as of last Friday. We can’t give it to you.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsopzr200033b6m5z28thpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pharmacist suggested that Haldeman try getting a prescription for the vaccine from her provider so the pharmacy might be able to administer it. Her obstetrician wrote a vaccination prescription and sent it to the Safeway pharmacy, but when Haldeman visited the location at 7 p.m. the same day, she was told the pharmacy hadn’t received the prescription.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblcex8x00003b6mq0hz836s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a statement from a company spokesperson, Safeway parent company Albertsons told CNN, “In accordance with recently updated CDC guidance, we adjusted our COVID-19 vaccination policies. Pregnant individuals with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness remain eligible for vaccination. We encourage all customers to consult with their healthcare providers for personalized advice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbtb0cra00003b6m3iojy2xj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The lack of clarity left Haldeman frustrated and uncertain about what to do next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000g3b6mgleulsou@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I spent half my day on this. … Most people are probably not going to go to those lengths to get the vaccine. The more hoops that you make people jump through, less and less people are just going to get vaccinated,” Haldeman said. “And we know that having Covid during pregnancy does terrible things to your placenta, and certainly reducing that risk is worth it. So it’s very frustrating.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbs98lzq00023b6m9uavkgs5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The American Pharmacists Association &lt;a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/APhA-Press-Releases/apha-withholds-endorsement-of-acip-adult-immunization-schedule" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a news release that the updates to the Covid-19 recommendations “do not appear to be based on the scientific evidence provided over the past few years. … COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy has been proven safe and effective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl8r7qf001d3b6mpe37lqi6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, pharmacists “may face consequences if they do not follow the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices or CDC recommendations,” said Allison Hill, the association’s director of professional affairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblafeuc001l3b6mmeqxlhtk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “HHS’s and CDC’s recent changes to the Covid-19 recommendations create barriers and confusion,” Hill said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbs9wmg600083b6mm8g75av9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HHS’s unusual updates to the Covid-19 vaccine schedules were followed this week by a sweeping change to the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the independent experts who typically guide the agency on its vaccine recommendations. Kennedy bypassed ACIP in making the Covid-19 changes and then &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/09/health/rfk-cdc-vaccine-advisers-removed"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; this week that he had dismissed the entire 17-member panel. On Wednesday, Kennedy announced &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/health/kennedy-new-members-vaccine-advisory-panel"&gt;eight new members&lt;/a&gt; to ACIP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsa1q4o000g3b6mgywqcf6g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The removal of the vaccine advisers sparked a swift backlash from health care providers and professional organizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqn9voh00023b6mq8hpgvnq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, another organization that signed the open letter, said that undermining the integrity of ACIP is “completely unfounded” and has “a significant negative impact on Americans of all ages.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqxzjed00003b6my4oc7j4h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The pharmacists association said&lt;a href="https://www.pharmacist.com/APhA-Press-Releases/apha-alarmed-by-elimination-of-acip-voting-membership" target="_blank"&gt; Tuesday,&lt;/a&gt; “It is highly concerning that removing 17 scientists overnight eliminates the historical knowledge, scientific training, and clinical expertise required to equip pharmacists and the public to make appropriate choices for health based upon the risk.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsesdv6001j3b6mnv34ptkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since Kennedy announced changes to the Covid-19 vaccine schedule, doctors said they’re worried about their patients and the future of vaccinations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbse8c8800183b6mbtavqvkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit,” Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. “We are concerned about access implications and what this recommendation will mean for insurance coverage of the COVID-19 vaccine for those who do choose to get vaccinated during pregnancy. And as ob-gyns, we are very concerned about the potential deterioration of vaccine confidence in the future.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsba5xu000v3b6m5m1dvcgu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37763105/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that infants who are born after a Covid-19 infection during pregnancy are at increased risk of stillbirth, respiratory distress and low birth weight.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblcsse300013b6mftu19cbp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “With maternal health being compromised, you have the risk for preterm delivery, babies that are born very small or potentially even fetal loss early on,” Dr. Flor Munoz-Rivas, an associate professor of pediatrics and infectious disease at Baylor College of Medicine, said last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000l3b6mu1q0pt0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. John Lynch, an associate medical director at the Harborview Medical Center and a colleague of Haldeman’s, said Covid-19 vaccination during pregnancy also has benefits for the newborn.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000m3b6mlim1uks1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccinating a mom leads to the protection of the baby when they don’t have their own immune response,” Lynch said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000n3b6mu7wra39p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since the Covid vaccine is not available to babies younger than 6 months, vaccinating the mother may be the safest way for young children to gain some immunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbl68ha7000o3b6mqyy7pu6n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That first year of life remains the highest period of risk, and this is a vaccine-preventable disease,” Muñoz said. “We can modify the outcomes for these babies through maternal vaccination and through infant vaccination.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Skinner has been concerned for years about the effects of certain chemicals on girls’ puberty, she told me in an email.

The parents involved are responding to a nationwide trend: The average age of menarche in the US &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/31/nx-s1-4985074/girls-are-getting-their-first-periods-earlier-heres-what-parents-should-know"&gt;has shifted earlier&lt;/a&gt;, from 12.5 between 1950 and 1969 to 11.9 between 2000 and 2005, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2819141"&gt;according to a 2024 study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The percentage of kids who get their first period before age 9 is also on the rise, more than doubling between the 1950s and the 2000s. Researchers are concerned about these trends because getting a first period earlier is associated with an increased risk of some health conditions, including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/30/well/live/girls-period-menstrual-cycle-study.html"&gt;breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has weighed in on the matter, &lt;a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-kennedy-sperm-testosterone-teens-fox-b2737911.html"&gt;claiming in an April appearance&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News that “girls are hitting puberty six years early.” He appeared to link the issue to children’s diets, arguing that “the food our kids are eating today is not really food.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But experts say the shift toward earlier periods likely stems from a variety of factors, including increased nutrition, higher body weight, stress, and environmental influences. Researchers are particularly concerned about the impact of chemicals called endocrine disruptors, which can mimic the activity of hormones in the body, said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/shruthi-mahalingaiah/"&gt;Shruthi Mahalingaiah&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of environmental, reproductive, and women’s health at Harvard University. These chemicals include &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/29/well/phthalates-heart-disease.html"&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt;, which can be present in shampoos, lotions, and other common products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some experts say it makes sense for parents to try to limit kids’ exposure to endocrine disruptors, but it’s impossible to avoid these compounds completely. And some say that expecting families to reverse a large-scale health trend — especially one involving something as intimate as menstruation — forces parents to become hypervigilant and could even put their kids at risk of eating disorders. “I definitely don’t think that it should be on individual parents to save their daughters from this possibly overblown idea of early menarche being a problem,” Christy Harrison, a registered dietitian and host of the podcast &lt;a href="https://rethinkingwellness.substack.com/podcast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rethinking Wellness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="why-earlier-periods-could-be-a-problem" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Why earlier periods could be a problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Experts are worried about the shift toward earlier menstruation because an earlier age at first period is linked with a variety of health risks, including &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/05/31/nx-s1-4985074/girls-are-getting-their-first-periods-earlier-heres-what-parents-should-know"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; and several reproductive cancers. Some research also suggests an increased risk of anxiety and depression, &lt;a href="https://appointments.childrensnational.org/provider/roopa-kanakatti-shankar/2359824"&gt;Roopa Kanakatti Shankar&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Getting a period at a younger age than their peers can also be stressful for kids. “Physically, they are reaching an adult-like state, but the cognitive development is still ongoing,” Shankar said. Managing the mechanics of pads, tampons, and tracking your cycle can be more difficult for younger kids, Mahalingaiah said (honestly, it remains a challenge for some adults). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Younger children may have a harder time handling the mood shifts that can come with the menstrual cycle, Shankar said. Girls who go through puberty earlier are also more likely to experience sexual harassment, according to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0272431614568198"&gt;some research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For these reasons (and others), creators like Skinner, who lives in New Zealand, are taking matters into their own hands. “The idea of delaying my daughter’s first period (menarche) as long as naturally possible isn’t about artificially controlling or fearing puberty — it’s about supporting long-term health and well-being in the face of modern environmental stressors,” she writes in her Instagram post, inviting readers to comment “DAUGHTER hormone support checklist” to learn more. Skinner &lt;a href="https://stan.store/nourished_and_vibrant?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAacwnZAdZs6bB7hULDJpeefZcmb0Bjfy0Fieus6o3C77xDhHl1YZhHYY66dWeA_aem_ffA5hxKfKcBqKtjOI_hLGA"&gt;also offers&lt;/a&gt; a variety of health coaching and “low tox” education services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Skinner clarified to me that “it’s not about ‘delaying’ their period,” but rather “creating an environment for them that doesn’t bring it on prematurely.” For her, that includes “eliminating personal care products with synthetic fragrance chemicals as well as swapping to glass and stainless steel in the kitchen in place of plastic.” She also focuses on feeding her kids “whole, real, and homemade food” about 80 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Bec Kinderman, a mom of four and homebirth advocate living in Australia, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI98Is-TP4G/?igsh=ZjM5MmYwdmh3Z2Ez"&gt;posted a similar message&lt;/a&gt; in April: “Let’s normalize pre teen girls being young, enjoying playgrounds and slowing down the onset of puberty.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kinderman, who did not respond to Vox’s request for comment, goes on to advise that parents choose whole foods over “convenience foods” that are “loaded up on seed oils and artificial ingredients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“While as parents we can’t control everything in our child’s environment &amp;amp; their life experiences &amp;amp; circumstances, there are things we can do to try to minimize these concerns,” Kinderman writes, in a post that received over 60,000 likes. “I will be daring and say that household toxins and diet are NUMBER ONE.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="can-parents-control-kids-periods" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Can parents control kids’ periods?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Several experts told me it’s reasonable for parents to try to limit endocrine-disrupting chemicals in their homes, such as by avoiding unnecessary fragrances or choosing safer cleaning products. “If you have the knowledge that you have a product that has these endocrine disruptors, and there is an alternative, to me it is reasonable to choose the one that doesn’t,” Aviva Sopher, a pediatric endocrinologist at Columbia University, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;However, Sopher said, it’s impossible to completely avoid these chemicals because they also occur outside the home, such as in products used on lawns and gardens. Products made without phthalates and other endocrine disruptors can also be more costly, making it harder for lower-income families to avoid them, Sopher added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, trying to influence the timing of a child’s period through diet could have unintended consequences, some say. “One of the biggest problems that can cause delayed menarche is disordered eating,” Harrison said. Indeed, a very late first period, like a very early one, is associated with health risks, possibly because of links with eating disorders, Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“I worry that the goal of delaying girls’ periods unintentionally encourages restricting their eating, and also potentially masks the signs of disordered eating,” Harrison said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Banning all processed foods from the home could also backfire. Kids who never have access to such foods often binge when they do encounter them, Harrison said: “I see that so often in kids who are restricted and deprived of sugar or snack foods, where they end up going to friends’ houses and just like staying around the snack drawer the whole time.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s worth noting, also, that real concerns around endocrine disruptors can sometimes exist alongside health misinformation. Kennedy, for example, has &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-claims-teenage-boys-113340103.html"&gt;discussed early puberty&lt;/a&gt; while also making misleading claims about &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rfk-jr-again-claims-autism-032802120.html"&gt;the dangers of Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and his ability to &lt;a href="/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning"&gt;find the “cause” of autism&lt;/a&gt; within a year. And seed oils, mentioned by Kinderman, are not associated with early puberty and are actually beneficial for health, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/09/well/eat/seed-oil-effects.html"&gt;according to nutrition scientists&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://campsite.bio/rebeccakinderman?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAae2RdPbPX3BR7hZdXwem3vKQi2JPjJSGmODLrDKVn_maewCvdOkKoZ0qfx2Pw_aem_HPyDPSaVKwZKXcsGc5A1UQ"&gt;Kinderman’s website&lt;/a&gt; also includes a link to a list of anti-vaccine resources.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Skinner agrees there’s a risk of children developing eating disorders “if parents are too fanatical about ONLY eating ‘good’ foods,” but says her 80–20 approach does not carry such a risk. “In our home we don’t demonize ANY food groups. We talk about how food makes them feel.” She doesn’t want concern about eating disorders to become an “excuse” for parents “not to take ownership for their role” — which, she says, “is to set their child up for the best chance of a healthful life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Others, however, say that placing the onus on families to prevent early menarche puts an “unfair blame and shame on parents, and especially moms,” who are still disproportionately in charge of what kids eat, Harrison said. Scientists still aren’t sure what role endocrine disruptors play in early puberty, and they are difficult to study, even for professionals because they can occur in extremely low amounts that may or may not add up over time, Shankar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Parents who are concerned that their daughters are going through early puberty — defined as breast development beginning before age 8 — should consult a doctor, Shankar said. On a societal level, we need more research into environmental influences on puberty, including endocrine disruptors, she added. Changes to public policy could also encourage companies “to be more aware and more sensitive about what they’re putting into the products that we’re all using,” Sopher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Stricter laws around air and water quality could be another way to address environmental factors along with “environmental justice regulations that keep certain groups from being disproportionately impacted by pollution,” Harrison said. (Despite Kennedy’s stated concern about earlier puberty, the Trump administration has actually &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks-list.html"&gt;rolled back dozens of laws&lt;/a&gt; around clean air and water.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“To the extent that things in our environment are affecting this trend, it’s on politicians and society,” Harrison said. “At the collective level, we need to make these changes, not put it on the individual.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Gun deaths of children rose in states that loosened gun laws after a 2010 Supreme Court decision, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/health/gun-deaths-children.html"&gt;according to a new study&lt;/a&gt;. In states that kept restrictions in place, deaths remained flat or even decreased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/ice-detained-queens-11th-grader-at-his-immigration-hearing-officials-say"&gt;11th-grade New York City student&lt;/a&gt; was detained by immigration authorities at an asylum hearing last week, school officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just 45 percent of 7th- to 12th-graders saw college as their most likely next step after high school in 2024, down from 73 percent in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/more-teens-leaning-toward-alternative-postsecondary-options/749798/"&gt;according to a new survey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;My older kid and I have discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/51F/the-area-51-files/"&gt;Area 51 Files series&lt;/a&gt;, about a middle-schooler forced to relocate to a top-secret base full of aliens.

Now, a global phase 3 clinical trial has offered the strongest evidence yet. Spanning over a decade and involving nearly 900 patients across six countries, this study focused on colon cancer patients who had completed surgery and chemotherapy. The findings? A structured exercise programme doesn't just help in healing, it may actually tilt the scales in favour of survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise can beat cancer: But what’s the truth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a growing belief that physical activity might help in preventing cancer or at least reduce its recurrence. While past studies only hinted at this link, this new phase 3 trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms it with rigorous data. Patients in the trial who followed a structured exercise routine for three years after chemotherapy saw a 28% lower risk of cancer recurrence and a 37% reduction in overall risk of death, compared to those who only received health advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just another wellness trend—it’s real science changing the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

It’s triggering a series of deeply biological responses: boosting metabolism, encouraging beneficial gut bacteria, and repairing the gut lining. This is crucial because a healthy gut barrier helps stop cancer-promoting substances from entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise increases the demand for glucose in muscles and organs, which leaves less fuel for potential tumour cells to thrive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also regulates insulin levels, which, when too high, are linked to several cancers including colon, breast and prostate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More than movement: Exercise as an immune ally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond metabolism, exercise plays another vital role—it strengthens the immune system’s surveillance ability. This means it helps the body spot and destroy rogue cells that could turn cancerous. Think of it as constantly updating the body’s internal security system.

While new medications often get approved for much smaller benefits (and come with toxicity risks), exercise delivered significant survival improvements with relatively mild side effects, mainly muscle-related issues in around 18% of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean exercise can replace drugs, but it can be a game-changing partner. Together, they make a more hostile environment for cancer to grow back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Early Detection Saves Lives: Watch for These Ovarian Cancer Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building a routine that works&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured movement isn’t a one-size-fits-all.

A blend of 150 minutes per week of aerobic and strength training, like walking, cycling, or light resistance workouts, is a good goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with a family history of colon cancer, regular physical activity, reduced red meat intake, a fibre-rich diet, and early screenings are essential.

              &lt;p&gt;One of the most common questions that doctors treating colon cancer get is: "What else can I do?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since colon cancer starts in the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gut-health-microbiome-trend-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;digestive&lt;/a&gt; tract, the food we put in our bodies is — rightly or wrongly — one of the first places people look, wondering: Is there some food I can eat that will help fight cancer, or some cancer-causing thing I should eliminate from my diet, stat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that how cancer emerges inside a body is quite complex. There isn't usually one single thing a person can do to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While attending the world's biggest cancer conference earlier this month, I figured I'd cut through some of the noise out there and ask top colon cancer doctors directly what they generally recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Oberstein, a medical oncologist at NYU Langone who specializes in gastrointestinal cancers, says his patients are often hunting for a winning &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/foods-that-boost-brain-health-neuro-nine-list-plants-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;superfood&lt;/a&gt; that can combat colon cancer. He fields questions routinely about the merits of avocados, pine nuts, and other items. Could adding those single items to the grocery cart help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While he says he's "doubtful" any single food can really make the difference in cancer recurrence, there are a few well-trodden truths doctors live by. These are backed by reams of study data from around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4b94983b-ebb1-4a5c-9746-781a8777426c" data-toc-id="4b94983b-ebb1-4a5c-9746-781a8777426c"&gt;Colon cancer doctors shun the meats and the sweets&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still can't say for sure whether there's one specific diet that is best to combat cancer, and especially &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/greek-doctor-how-to-eat-for-health-longevity-on-budget-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;one diet that's best for you&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, people with seemingly &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;"clean" diets do get digestive cancers&lt;/a&gt;, even in their 30s and 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, these four foods are consistently included in diets that seem to lead to cancer diagnoses later on, so oncologists warn against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="c5be940f-0623-4581-bc7f-9e23ce7f73a1" data-toc-id="c5be940f-0623-4581-bc7f-9e23ce7f73a1"&gt;Red meat&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Oberstein says patients often want to get prescriptive about it: Can I have red meat once a week? Twice a month? He's not really comfortable getting that granular with his advice, based on the data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just don't have the quantification and the confidence to say it's either for sure going to help, or you can't have it ever," he told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietician Lindsey Wohlford from MD Anderson Cancer Center created a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdanderson.org/publications/focused-on-health/your-guide-to-eating-less-red-meat.h26Z1590624.html" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;chart in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that recommends eating no more than two softballs' worth (18 oz.) of red meat per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="4dff9951-7086-47c9-8cb9-a99d7aa188f4" data-toc-id="4dff9951-7086-47c9-8cb9-a99d7aa188f4"&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages, including fruit juice and syrupy drinks&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It's common knowledge in the medical community that over-consumption of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sugar-coffee-soda-could-be-linked-to-early-death-2019-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;sugar-sweetened beverages&lt;/a&gt; — including fruit juices, flavored coffees, and soda — can sharply up a person's risk of all kinds of diseases, from diabetes to colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks are more potent than sweet foods because liquid sugar is absorbed very fast — sometimes too fast. It can saturate the small intestine, spilling excess sugar into the colon.

She said it's not exactly a new idea that sugar can drive cancer growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's even data in animal models that fructose can lead to polyps," Cercek told BI. Her latest find opens up new questions about what might be prompting more aggressive cases of young colon cancer. "Is sugar maybe somehow driving and accelerating this process?" Cercek asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="852478cb-bf83-46cd-a33f-05b5ef838cfa" data-toc-id="852478cb-bf83-46cd-a33f-05b5ef838cfa"&gt;Alcohol — especially binge drinking and drinking on an empty stomach&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;In a very basic sense, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-affects-your-brain-body-cancer-new-science-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; is just fermented sugar, and it seems to carry a lot of the same cancer risks. Additionally, our liver breaks down alcohol into acetaldehyde, a known cancer-causing chemical that can damage DNA. Finally, alcohol dampens nutrient absorption and can kill off good bacteria in your gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In study after study, alcohol consumption is linked to more colon cancer diagnoses, and in general the more you drink, the greater your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests there might be something especially harmful about binge drinking or drinking on an empty stomach, when it comes to colon cancer. Most cancer doctors are not going to insist you can't enjoy a glass of wine or beer now and then, but they would probably say it's best to have it with a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1835dd34-a7e4-4192-a4f7-8e192acd04c8" data-toc-id="1835dd34-a7e4-4192-a4f7-8e192acd04c8"&gt;Colon cancer doctors love greens and a morning cuppa Joe&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're feeling hopeless now, buck up!

            &lt;p&gt;Fiber has a reputation for being great at keeping folks full and regular. But that's not all that it does. It also picks up debris in your gut, helping clear out the junk, and dropping off good guy bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's why Dr. Pashtoon Kasi, a medical oncologist at City of Hope who specializes in GI cancers, said it's "not just fiber for fiber's sake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says it's underappreciated how fiber is "ameliorating or modulating the microbiome" in ways that may help prevent cancer in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="83a93601-d732-401c-b610-278b571dc9cd" data-toc-id="83a93601-d732-401c-b610-278b571dc9cd"&gt;Coffee (without sugar)&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;"Coffee comes up in every study," Oberstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great news for him personally, because he runs on the stuff. (But he says you don't need to feel pressured to start drinking coffee if you don't enjoy it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be something deeply beneficial about the anti-inflammatory properties of coffee. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/should-drink-coffee-prevent-colorectal-cancer" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that coffee isn't just good at preventing colon cancer (in one study, coffee drinkers had roughly 26% lower odds of contracting colon cancer) — people with colon cancer diagnoses who drink several cups of coffee a day also lower their odds of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="aa70bb29-1cd0-4d15-a71c-55ffd591081f" data-toc-id="aa70bb29-1cd0-4d15-a71c-55ffd591081f"&gt;The takeaway: add veggies and beans in where you can&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Beans are loaded with fiber and slow to digest, both good attributes.

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If you're looking for more widespread dietary advice, the National Comprehensive Cancer Care network guidelines for colon cancer patients recommend sticking to a "low glycemic load" diet, which means choosing more foods that are slow to digest and pack a fiber-rich punch. Low-glycemic foods include all kinds of fruits, veggies, nuts, beans, and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kimmie Ng, a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber, where she is the founding director of the young-onset colorectal cancer center, says her recommendations fit this basic framework:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A diet less in red meat and processed foods and more in healthy proteins and fruits and vegetables is generally what we recommend," she told BI. "We know that that's typically anti-inflammatory and just healthier overall for a variety of chronic diseases, including cancer."&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dropcap"&gt;E&lt;/span&gt;arly in his new book &lt;em&gt;These Strange New Minds&lt;/em&gt;, Oxford cognitive neuroscience professor and U.K. Google DeepMind AI researcher Chris Summerfield describes a classic cartoon scene in which Wile E. Coyote has just been led over a cliff by Road Runner, his legs churning for solid ground as he briefly hovers above the canyon below, moments from a catastrophic plunge. “I am writing this book because we have just gone over that cliff,” asserts Summerfield. “The safe ground we have left behind is a world where humans alone generate knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;
      
    &lt;p&gt;Knowledge is, after all, power. It is what has enabled humans to build gleaming civilizations on Earth, to explore the reaches of our starry solar system, to dream up mind-bending artworks, and to grasp the material, cultural, and political dimensions of our everyday realities. As AIs become increasingly savvy at producing and acting on knowledge, what will they or those who control them do with it? In whose interest will they act, especially if AIs begin cooperating with one another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summerfield is, at least in the immediate future, less worried about the technology itself than about humans’ capacity to understand how it works and to interact with it intelligently. And this is, in part, the purpose of &lt;em&gt;These Strange New Minds&lt;/em&gt;: to help readers understand precisely how LLMs work, how they use language, and why the results look so much like human thought and speech. Over the course of the book, he takes us on a tour of the history of AI’s development—from its early philosophical underpinnings to its pop culture inspirations and impacts and explores our shifting ethics as it relates to these new minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Summerfield argues that LLMs are not sentient—at least not in any way humans can understand—that they’re unlikely to take over and destroy the world, but that they may well exacerbate existing problems. After all, AI’s limitations are not that dissimilar from those of the human brain, he says. We spoke with Summerfield about the limitations and risks of a technological revolution that is approaching so rapidly we’ve barely had time to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

Coyote, we have all just gone over a cliff in our relationship with AI. “The safe ground we have left behind is a world where humans alone generate knowledge.”&lt;em&gt; Photo by Catalina Renjifo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You use Wile E Coyote as a metaphor for the “cliff” we’ve run over in regard to AI. How did we get here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology hasn’t yet outrun our ability to control it, but this is the direction of travel. The metaphor refers to the unknowns associated with a new world in which AI systems can generate new knowledge—the first time an agent other than a human has been able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the significance of the language in large language models?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For humans, language is our superpower. Language is the critical cognitive advance that unlocked our ability to cooperate and collaborate and build an advanced civilization. Language allows us to share knowledge with each other, and to create new knowledge by combining ideas: Think of a horse with a horn—oh! A unicorn. So, the fact that AI has learned to talk is a really, really big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To what extent does AI’s mastery of language give it some of the same super-powers as humans—such as the ability to cooperate and to share and create new knowledge?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperation requires more than just language—it requires the ability to infer the beliefs and preferences of others, and to adapt to the social world. We haven’t yet extensively tested situations where LLMs interact with each other, to understand what the consequences may be. Their ability to reason, however, gives AI systems the opportunity to create new ideas, by putting existing pieces of knowledge together in novel ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do LLMs “understand” language or are they just good at acting like it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is we don’t have widely agreed definitions for what it means to “understand” something in the first place. Do you “understand” how a combustion engine works? Do you “understand” why World War II happened? We don’t have strong criteria for making hard and fast judgments like this. What we can say, however, is that LLMs’ formal competence in language, including in generating entirely novel utterances, is as good as or better than a human, at least for English and other well-resourced languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology hasn’t yet outrun our ability to control it, but this is the direction of travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book you explore assertions that AI has become or will become conscious. How could AI consciousness impact society?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t think it would affect society at all, because we would never know whether it is conscious or not. When it comes to any agent other than ourselves, consciousness is very much in the eye of the beholder—I can’t experience your subjectivity, but if you display certain behaviors, I will treat you &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; you are conscious. We do this with our pets all the time. I expect that as AI becomes more humanlike, people will come to believe that it is conscious, but we won’t ever know for sure whether that is right or not.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will AI be a tool, or a new form of person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s more useful to think about AI as a tool, and in particular as a sort of digital service that we can use to make decisions on our behalf. People need to remember that when talking to AI they are not interacting with a person—they are using a service that is provided by a technology company. But if it behaves in humanlike ways, it will definitely be tempting to treat AI like a human. However, I am not convinced that what we need is more humans—we have 8 billion of them already. We need better tools for organizing society, so that we can live together more peacefully, prosperously, and equitably—variables that are in short supply right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can LLMs “think?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs carry out reasoning steps in natural language that resemble those that you and I might make when solving a problem. They can even say these steps to themselves out loud whilst they are reasoning, and—just like for you and me—this improves their chances of finding a good solution. But we haven’t really clearly defined what it means for a human to “think” so there will always be room for some people to claim that what AI systems are doing does not count as “thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book you push back against the idea that the use of the word “computation” as a metaphor for human thinking is somehow socially oppressive. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people have argued that if we use the metaphor that the brain computes information, we are somehow lowering people to the level of computers, and that this is intrinsically harmful. I agree that it’s important for us to maintain a notion of human “difference”—we have our own concerns, and they should be treasured—but I think the general idea that it’s oppressive to use computation as a metaphor for the brain is a bit silly. It’s just a useful way of thinking about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to remember that when talking to AI they are not interacting with a person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You discuss the risks posed by AI “autopropaganda.” How would this differ from the digital misinformation we’re facing today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Algorithms embedded in content recommendation systems, such as social media platforms, already ensure that we view “autopropaganda”—propaganda for the views we already hold, i.e. that confirms our existing beliefs. If AI became highly personalized, there is a risk that it could behave similarly, only telling you what you want to hear. The difference would be that AI systems can actively engage with you in persuasive dialogue, so the effect risks being much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many people envision a near future where AI solves the looming issues of the day, but as you discuss in the book, this expectation may be misplaced. Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI is very good at retrieving knowledge and reasoning about formal problems, but many of the issues that we face today require a different sort of skill—the ability to bring people together to cooperate. We have yet to see much evidence that AI is good at this—although there have been some early attempts, including one that I &lt;a href="http://habermas.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; at Deepmind. [A study on whether AI can function as a political mediator.] The ability to solve formal problems, like playing Go at Grandmaster level or solving logic puzzles, does not necessarily equip you for the real world, where things tend to be quite messy. Outcomes are uncertain—stochastic rather than deterministic—and challenges can arise without warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You close the book by exploring some of the potential AI doomsday scenarios. What worries you the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrival of AI is likely to exacerbate systemic problems that already exist, such as disruption to the labor market from growing automation, the concentration of capital in the hands of large multinational companies, the spread of mis/disinformation in the information ecosystem, the use of cyber technologies for criminal or destabilizing attacks on critical infrastructure, and the environmental costs of intensive demand for energy, water, and rare earth minerals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am worried about what will happen when AI systems begin to interact with each other. As humans, we are not all that smart on our own. You might think you are smarter than a chimp, but if I stranded you both on a desert island, my money is on the chimp surviving longer. We are good at cooperating, and our intelligence is enabled by our social world. When agents start to interact, they will naturally find modes of acting and communicating that may be misaligned with human values. This is what worries me most! &lt;img decoding="async" class="wp-image-13765" src="https://assets.nautil.us/sites/3/nautilus/nautilus-favicon-14.png?fm=png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lead image: cybermagician / Shutterstock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;              &lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="fragment-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

For years, people only really thought about their liver when they were drinking too much or when a doctor brought up scary stuff like hepatitis. But now? Everyone’s talking about fatty liver, detoxing, enzyme levels, and all things liver-related—and here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is quietly becoming a global epidemic. You don’t need to be a drinker to have liver issues anymore—junk food, sugar, sedentary lifestyle, and even stress can mess it up. And most people don’t even realize they have a problem until it's advanced. Secondly, your liver is your body’s main detox organ. It filters out all the stuff you throw at it—alcohol, meds, pollutants, processed foods, you name it. So if your liver isn’t in top shape, neither are you. From hormonal imbalances to acne to chronic fatigue—yep, your liver might be the culprit. Also, the rise in fitness culture and functional medicine is making people think beyond just abs and protein shakes. Now, it's about feeling good inside out—and that means showing some love to the organ that quietly keeps you alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Dr Saurabh Sethi, who is very popular on social media shared how liver diseases progress. Not just this, the doctor shared two ways to keep the liver healthy. Dr Sethi explains how a liver disease progresses from simple fatty liver disease to inflammation and cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the video, Dr Sethi recommends two ways to keep the liver healthy: reducing alcohol consumption and staying metabolically healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Want a healthy liver? Cut the booze and fix that metabolic mess&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about that one organ that works harder than your boss and rarely gets credit: your liver. It’s your body’s detox machine, fuel processor, fat regulator, and overall superhero. And guess what? It’s under attack—every single day—especially if you’re living on a diet of fries, sugar, zero movement, and weekend binge-drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, two big villains in this story? Alcohol and poor metabolic health. But the good news? You have more control than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, alcohol. We all know heavy drinking can wreck your liver. But what a lot of people don’t realize is that even moderate drinking, when done regularly, can sneakily damage your liver over time. The liver breaks down alcohol, and in the process, it produces toxic byproducts like acetaldehyde. That stuff is no joke—it inflames your liver and triggers scarring. Over time, this can lead to fatty liver, fibrosis, and even cirrhosis. The scary part? Most of this happens quietly, without symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting back—or quitting altogether—gives your liver breathing room to heal. Yes, your liver can actually regenerate, but only if you stop beating it up with round after round of alcohol. Even cutting down to a few drinks a week instead of daily can make a huge difference. Think of it like giving your liver a break from overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s metabolic health. Your liver doesn’t just suffer when you drink—it also takes a hit when your blood sugar is out of whack, you’re gaining belly fat, or you’re insulin-resistant. That’s what we call poor metabolic health, and it’s become the new silent killer. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now one of the most common liver problems worldwide, and yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like: fat accumulating in your liver even if you don’t drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens because your liver plays a major role in processing sugar and fat. So when your body is constantly dealing with high blood sugar levels (hello, processed carbs and sodas), it stores the excess as fat—including in the liver. Add in low physical activity and weight gain around the waist, and you’ve got a recipe for liver overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what can you do?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cut the sugar. Move more. Eat more whole foods. Get better sleep. Keep your weight in check. Basically, if you clean up your lifestyle—even just a little—your liver responds fast. Drop 5–10% of your body weight and your fatty liver risk drops too. Start walking daily, and your insulin levels improve. Get better sleep and inflammation goes down. It’s all connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to go on crazy juice cleanses or buy “liver detox” powders. Your best bet is to reduce alcohol, eat like you care about your body, and stay metabolically healthy. Your liver is tough—but even superheroes need backup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 05:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>长寿：简单的血液测试能说明您的衰老情况吗？ -今日医学新闻 | Longevity: Could a simple blood test tell all about your aging? - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOOHFkblJLbDhSOFhxZl9EUGdCRG5jbTNOT0o3ekw2WTFELWFzWDFLejNMdFFfZUJWOUxocnVVaEVsR3lwSkpwaWpfaC1ZRExWTHJTbENxUkw4X2VuNEtBdzFBM3IzQXJrQ3BJOWozd0pjVm92NTVnX0NpaHBnLTFqUnpvbldZM0M1Y3hpZThQb0VzNUpHa29paWxKLTQwYU5MMUE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/longevity-blood-Stocksy_txp99037833Va8400_Medium_2645153-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/longevity-blood-Stocksy_txp99037833Va8400_Medium_2645153-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/longevity-blood-Stocksy_txp99037833Va8400_Medium_2645153-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/longevity-blood-Stocksy_txp99037833Va8400_Medium_2645153-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="researcher processing blood sample" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fa-simple-blood-test-could-indicate-how-long-you-might-live&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F06%2Flongevity-blood-Stocksy_txp99037833Va8400_Medium_2645153-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Longevity%3A%20Could%20a%20simple%20blood%20test%20tell%20all%20about%20your%20aging%3F" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/06/longevity-blood-Stocksy_txp99037833Va8400_Medium_2645153-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Researchers are developing a simple blood test that could assess your health span and lifespan.

However, measuring intrinsic capacity has, until now, required sophisticated equipment and trained personnel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has found that measuring &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2012112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; in blood samples to assess intrinsic capacity effectively predicts all-cause mortality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which is published in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00883-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, suggests that the IC clock could be a useful tool for tracking aging and guiding targeted interventions to maintain function in older age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/thomas-m-holland-md-ms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Thomas M. Holland&lt;/a&gt;, MD, MS, a physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in this study, commented for &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A blood- or saliva-based test for intrinsic capacity, known as DNAm IC, is a very promising tool in aging science. […] This test uses DNA methylation patterns, chemical tags that regulate gene activity, to estimate your IC biologically, offering insights into how well your body is functioning compared to your chronological age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most critical aspects is that this test can be done with a simple blood or saliva sample, making it accessible and noninvasive. It tells us not just how old you are, but how well you are aging, which is much more meaningful to help inform which interventions should be implemented, if any, to help prevent future health problems,” Holland explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://healthmiro.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Elena Rolt&lt;/a&gt;, MSc, DipION, IFMCP, a Registered Nutritional Therapist and Functional Medicine Practitioner and cofounder of Health Miro, who was not involved in this research, also welcomed the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DNA methylation-based intrinsic capacity (DNAm IC) test shows significant potential as a practical measure of biological aging,“ Rolt told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;. “Unlike traditional epigenetic clock based tests, it also captures functional aging more directly.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“As it reflects immune aging, physical capacity and lifestyle-related risk factors, this test may be particularly relevant for personalised aging interventions and preventive strategies,” she added.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However,” Rolt cautioned, “its use should be complementary to other markers — e.g. PhenoAge, GrimAge, functional tests — and its utility in clinical practice will depend on further validation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from 1,014 people from the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7352084/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;INSPIRE-T cohort&lt;/a&gt;, aged between 20 and 102 years, the researchers developed an IC score using five aspects of age-related decline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;cognition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;locomotion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;sensory (vision and hearing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;psychological&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;vitality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From blood and saliva tests, the researchers collected data on &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2012112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; — a process that activates or deactivates genes.

People with the highest DNAm IC had better lung function, faster walking speed, greater bone mineral density and were more likely to view themselves as healthy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And people with a high DNAm IC lived, on average, 5.5 years longer than those with a low DNAm IC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland told us this was a very significant finding: “Scientifically, this reflects strong associations between high IC and better immune function, lower chronic inflammation, and reduced risk for diseases like hypertension, heart failure, stroke, and other age-related conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Simply,” he added, “if your body is functioning well internally you are more likely to live longer and stay healthier. This test doesn’t just give a snapshot of your current state; it may also offer a glimpse into your future health.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In everyone, intrinsic capacity declines with age, but there are measures that can help to slow that decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that people with a high dietary intake of oily fish, and sugar intake that was within recommended guidelines (no more than 5% of total energy intake), were more likely to have a high DNAm IC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://london-regenerative.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Tunç Tiryaki&lt;/a&gt;, board-certified plastic surgeon and founder of the London Regenerative Institute, who was not involved in the recent study, explained the association:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oily fish are rich in long-chain &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; (EPA and DHA), which have anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and mitochondrial-supportive properties. These mechanisms are closely aligned with domains of IC such as vitality and cognitive function. &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/omega-3-what-it-can-and-cant-do-for-health" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Omega-3s&lt;/a&gt; also modulate gene expression related to immune responses and cellular senescence, pathways shown to be enriched in the DNAm IC signature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conversely, excessive sugar intake is known to accelerate glycation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, all of which impair IC,” Tiryaki told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying within recommended sugar limits likely supports metabolic flexibility and reduces inflammatory burden, preserving cognitive and physical function. These dietary factors likely influence DNAm IC by modulating epigenetic regulation and immune aging, thus helping maintain functional capacity,“ he detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland, Tiryaki, and Rolt recommended a number of measures to help ensure healthy aging. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;following a healthy diet, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mind-diet" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;MIND&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; diet, that is rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, wholegrains, and healthy fats, such as those found in nuts, olive oil and oily fish&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;regular physical activity, including aerobic activity, strength training and balance exercises; Tiryaki emphasized that physical activity “supports locomotion and vitality and influences mitochondrial function and immune health, both of which are linked to IC”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cognitive and social engagement — keeping your brain stimulated and maintaining social networks are both associated with healthier aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ensuring that you manage stress and any chronic diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holland told us that the DNAm clock was a major advance in functional aging science: “It links molecular biology with real-world outcomes like mobility, cognition and lifespan. While further validation is needed, especially in older adults with low IC, this study lays the groundwork for using personalised epigenetic markers to guide interventions in preventive geriatrics, longevity medicine and precision public health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DNAm IC reflects not only how long you might live, but how well you might function, and that shift in focus is central to meaningful longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– Thomas M. Holland, MD, MS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 05:35:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOOHFkblJLbDhSOFhxZl9EUGdCRG5jbTNOT0o3ekw2WTFELWFzWDFLejNMdFFfZUJWOUxocnVVaEVsR3lwSkpwaWpfaC1ZRExWTHJTbENxUkw4X2VuNEtBdzFBM3IzQXJrQ3BJOWozd0pjVm92NTVnX0NpaHBnLTFqUnpvbldZM0M1Y3hpZThQb0VzNUpHa29paWxKLTQwYU5MMUE</guid></item><item><title>致命的脑吞噬变形虫，加上镁缺乏症状-福克斯新闻 | Deadly brain-eating amoebas, plus symptoms of magnesium deficiency - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNZW5nckxja3d5RWkxR2R3dXBLc05uX05tb0M5NGJUUVo4MVc0RjVwOTlQQkRaMnV5Zm1UNzlveTRFUUJfeVFsYXcxaTVWUlVmNEJtbkc5ZDJkVnd3Vy02d1FJY1E5SWpfQ1AzczdQaVJtQzE0ckZKNC1PR2dnNmd6U0pkZDJwN1dObmVZakxrY0J4Z9IBlwFBVV95cUxQcmlxQVFKeVREeDJuQ3dYUVdnUGZ6VUMyOXhOVG52S281LXJvYkEyQ0Z4MmplbjdNMGUtWXVFM2tqQkJyVnlWUzlTTi1MbUFkNGR0c0p4NVIxdjJjaGlib0gtOVVScjRWY0ltX1BleUxUbEJRWVcyRFc1cndHVmR1aERRSjFaVlZvY2UxT1kyanlWaGJiQnVz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 04:24:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNZW5nckxja3d5RWkxR2R3dXBLc05uX05tb0M5NGJUUVo4MVc0RjVwOTlQQkRaMnV5Zm1UNzlveTRFUUJfeVFsYXcxaTVWUlVmNEJtbkc5ZDJkVnd3Vy02d1FJY1E5SWpfQ1AzczdQaVJtQzE0ckZKNC1PR2dnNmd6U0pkZDJwN1dObmVZakxrY0J4Z9IBlwFBVV95cUxQcmlxQVFKeVREeDJuQ3dYUVdnUGZ6VUMyOXhOVG52S281LXJvYkEyQ0Z4MmplbjdNMGUtWXVFM2tqQkJyVnlWUzlTTi1MbUFkNGR0c0p4NVIxdjJjaGlib0gtOVVScjRWY0ltX1BleUxUbEJRWVcyRFc1cndHVmR1aERRSjFaVlZvY2UxT1kyanlWaGJiQnVz</guid></item><item><title>热门“我一天吃什么”视频可能有5个危险的缺点- ScienceAlert | Popular 'What I Eat in a Day' Videos Could Have 5 Dangerous Downsides - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPQW84QnlhdkVqYzBXd00yRURtcjhiYnBVU2N6SDZXQjN4eGFRTFVhMlI2Wlh0MXVfYk5fblhNRDF5V1doQXZKaWIwQUdHbjJQREtBREV1cFYwbjNxOFlFcWtteVdjdFZRVmxidG41LUQ0bUYxTnE3Tjk2S0xtcXVuT0lwZm53aHUtSlZkd1dQdWlXV1VncEFtY0d4WFY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;You may have come across those "what I eat in a day" videos on social media, where people – usually conventionally attractive influencers wearing activewear – list everything they consumed that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might seem like harmless fun but in fact they can reinforce dangerous ideas about food, weight and body image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've worked with people with eating disorders who watch these videos and have seen first hand how harmful this content can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what the research says and what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Videos that promote 'health' can be unhealthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What I eat in a day" videos have been popular for over a decade, with views reaching in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;billions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They target both men and women and many claim to promote health and nutrition. Yet videos such as these can do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few of these creators have formal &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10410236.2023.2260966#d1e678"&gt;qualifications&lt;/a&gt; in health or nutrition, increasing the potential for &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14407833231161369"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They often &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;depict&lt;/a&gt; low calorie diets, exclude entire food groups or promote "clean eating" (a problematic idea at best).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some even &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;encourage dangerous behaviours&lt;/a&gt; such as skipping meals, eating very little or using laxatives to purge food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can also send harmful messages about body image. Many such videos use &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;beauty filters&lt;/a&gt; to create images promoting unrealistic body ideals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These videos often feature shots of how the person looks from the front, the side, in the gym, and in tight, form-fitting clothes. There may even be some "before and after" weight loss pics, sending the harmful message this should be everyone's goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subtext is clear: "eat what I eat in a day and you can look like me".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164412" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164412" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day_642.jpg" alt="fit person in the kitchen" class="wp-image-164412 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164412" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The subtext is clear. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEdJM5ELfk/"&gt;alphaspirit.it/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that's not just a dangerous idea – it's a totally false and erroneous one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what a certain person "eats in a day" doesn't mean you'll look like them if you follow their lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, a 24-hour rundown of one person's food intake doesn't even provide accurate information about that person's nutritional health – let alone yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You are not them&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like our health, our nutritional needs are unique to us and can vary day to day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What constitutes a "healthy" choice for one person might be totally different for another depending on things such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links between health and diet are best examined &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35475441/"&gt;over time&lt;/a&gt;, not in a single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basing our food intake on a brief snapshot of what someone else eats is unlikely to lead to better health. It might leave you worse off overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 ways these videos can affect mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we watch online can affect our &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02673843.2019.1590851"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, behaviour and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.12581"&gt;body image&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarm bells should ring if you frequently see these videos and notice you're doing or experiencing these five things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Disordered eating. Eating less than your body needs, skipping meals, cutting out entire food groups, binge eating and purging are all signs of disordered eating that can lead to serious mental health problems such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10082698/"&gt;eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Low mood. Watching videos promoting low-calorie diets can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144524000342?via%3Dihub"&gt;worsen&lt;/a&gt; our mood; you might find yourself feeling deflated after &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144524000342?via%3Dihub"&gt;comparing&lt;/a&gt; yourself to others (or rather, to the version of themselves they promote online)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Poor body image. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1740144524000342?via%3Dihub"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows watching "what I eat in a day" videos can leave people feeling worse about their bodies and appreciating them less&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Obsessive thinking and anxiety. Obsessing over the "perfect" diet can increase &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40519-021-01110-x"&gt;anxiety about food&lt;/a&gt; and eating. Diets that encourage a very detailed approach to nutrition – including breaking meals down into components such as carbohydrates and proteins or weighing food – can further fuel obsessive thoughts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Narrow life focus. Having your social media feed filled with these types of videos can create an overemphasis on the importance of food, eating and body image on your self-worth. This ultimately affects your health and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12711261/"&gt;wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164415" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164415" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day2_642.jpg" alt="teen boy on phone" class="wp-image-164415 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/eat_in_a_day2_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164415" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Food videos often target young men and women, affecting health and wellbeing. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAED_vl7rlI/"&gt;Vesnaandjic/Getty Images Signature/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;OK, so what can I do?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're encountering "what I eat in a day" videos often and find they're affecting your mood, eating behaviour or sense of self-worth you can try to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;understand that these videos are not tailored to your individual health or nutritional needs and that many contain harmful messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;avoid engaging with videos that promote disordered eating, idealised beauty standards or that make you feel bad after you watch them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;unfollow accounts that regularly post such videos, or tap "not interested" on the TikTok video to stop the algorithm showing you more of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;balance your social media feed with content focused on other areas of life besides food and eating (such as art, design, animals, books, sports or travel). Fill your feed with interests that improve your personal sense of wellbeing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;consider taking regular breaks from social media and seeing if you feel better overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do want to view posts about food, seek out creators attempting to buck these negative trends by focusing more on &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1471015323000594?via%3Dihub"&gt;fun and taste&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you're experiencing low mood, disordered eating or body image issues, seek help from your local GP. They can connect you with practitioners who provide evidence-based therapies such as &lt;a href="https://www.aacbt.org.au/cbt-information/#WhatIsCBT"&gt;cognitive behavioural therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a history of an eating disorder or suspect you may have one, you can contact the &lt;a href="https://butterfly.org.au/"&gt;Butterfly Foundation's national helpline&lt;/a&gt; on 1800 334 673 (or via their online chat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, "what I eat in a day" videos aren't really helpful. They contain very little useful information to guide your health or nutritional goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are considering making changes to your diet, it's important to consult a qualified professional, such as an accredited practising dietitian, who can learn about your situation and monitor any risks.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/257127/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Marginalized populations, including women and girls, may suffer disproportionately from increased prevalence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by snail-carried worms. Infection typically starts with making contact with the worms in freshwater, such as in a canal, river, or pond. Person-to-person transmission can continue when urine or feces containing the parasite's eggs contaminates a water source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms — including fever, chills, coughing, and aches — can manifest within a couple of months, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/symptoms/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:per;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;per&lt;/a&gt; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Chronic infections can lead to anemia, bloody stools, urinary problems, organ damage, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Historically, 90% of the schistosomiasis cases requiring treatment have been located in Africa, but infections have also been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schistosomiasis/about/index.html#:~:text=Key%20points,water%20that%20contains%20these%20snails." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:documented;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; in Asia, the Americas, and the Middle East. While the London-based outlet has &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; more recent spreading in parts of Europe may be largely tourism- and migration-driven, researcher Bonnie Webster also told the publication that transmissions may emerge in further locations due to shifting weather patterns. Rising global temperatures are driving more frequent and more intense flooding events, causing snails to appear in new wet settings and increasing water contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Climate change will likely cause dramatic changes in transmission which need to be understood," Webster, who studies the disease at London's Natural History Museum, &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Telegraph. "Some areas will become drier and other areas will become flooded, creating new water bodies. This will lead to snails changing where they can be found and cause the prevalence of schistosomiasis to increase and spread, leading to outbreaks in new locations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Communities in low- and middle-income countries lacking sufficient sanitation infrastructure are already disproportionately impacted by this serious issue, and women and girls are additionally vulnerable to its effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is the parasite's spread concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All people can become infected by these parasites, but one manifestation of the disease — female genital schistosomiasis, or FGS — can cause sexual, reproductive, and other health concerns for women and girls. Gendered labor dynamics can make this group additionally susceptible to infection through activities like washing laundry in contaminated water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlimit Health &lt;a href="https://unlimithealth.org/ntds/female-genital-schistosomiasis/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:says;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that around 56 million women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with FGS, which can go undiagnosed and, especially when misdiagnosed as a sexually transmitted infection or otherwise left untreated, can lead to bleeding, pelvic pain, ulcers, miscarriage, and infertility. It may also contribute to increased risks of HIV and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250412/New-study-connects-parasitic-disease-to-genetic-changes-in-the-cervical-lining.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cervical cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, schistosomiasis impacts hundreds of millions of people each year, resulting in up to 20,000 deaths annually, &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; The Telegraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unfortunately, as Webster &lt;a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/rare-deadly-african-snail-disease-schistosomiasis-europe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, "Once one snail is infected, they can infect a whole population of humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done to help?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While treatments exist, potential drug resistance and current medical shortages could hamper attempts to curtail infections.

							&lt;p&gt;I was sitting with my morning coffee in Singapore, scrolling through Instagram DMs, when something stopped me cold. A few days earlier, I'd published &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/news/j-the-unexpected-mental-health-consequences-of-veganism-according-to-medical-research/"&gt;an article about the research showing vegans have significantly higher rates of depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. I expected pushback from the vegan community. What I didn't expect was this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm not even vegan," read one message, "but your article made me realize why I've been so miserable since starting CrossFit. I can't admit to my gym friends that I'm burned out because being 'the fitness guy' is all I have left."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another: "I've been calling myself a minimalist for three years, but I'm secretly drowning in anxiety about whether I own too much. I can't buy anything without feeling like I'm betraying who I am."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then this one, which made me set my phone down entirely: "I left my corporate job to become a 'conscious entrepreneur' and now I'm more trapped than ever. I can't pivot my failing business because everyone knows me as the guy who escaped the rat race. What happens to my identity if I go back?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something clicked. This wasn't about veganism at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages kept coming—dozens of them—from people who'd never touched a plant-based diet but recognized something in &lt;a href="https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/j-i-wrote-about-veganism-and-mental-health-and-was-stunned-by-how-many-people-are-suffering-in-silence/"&gt;my follow-up piece about the psychological cost of living by strict ethical codes&lt;/a&gt;. Christians questioning their faith but terrified to lose their community. Democrats who disagreed with party positions but couldn't voice dissent. Parents suffocating under the weight of attachment parenting philosophies they'd adopted as gospel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I was looking at the hidden epidemic of our time: a generation of people who've confused temporary alignments with permanent essence, mistaking belief systems for identity itself. And it's quietly destroying us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through my decade of work with &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io"&gt;The Vessel&lt;/a&gt;—the platform I co-founded to help people develop authentic self-knowledge—I'd seen glimpses of this pattern. But it took those Instagram messages to show me how universal it really is. We've become a society of ideological orphans, desperately adopting belief systems as surrogate families, then defending them with the fierce loyalty of abandoned children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental health crisis among vegans isn't about B12 deficiencies or social pressure. It's about what happens when any beautiful choice becomes a psychological prison. And once you see this pattern, you can't unsee it everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're living through the collapse of traditional meaning-making structures—religion, extended family, stable communities, geographical rootedness. But instead of grieving this loss and building something new, we've been frantically grabbing onto ideologies like life rafts, then clinging to them so tightly we forget we know how to swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about my friend Sarah, a brilliant lawyer who became vegan after watching a documentary about factory farming. Within six months, she wasn't just someone who ate plants—she *was* vegan. When she started experiencing digestive issues and brain fog, she couldn't bring herself to try eliminating certain foods because that felt like betraying not just animals, but herself. "If I'm not vegan," she asked me, "then who am I?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question haunts me because I've asked variations of it myself. When I &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/i-thought-id-escaped-the-corporate-grind-heres-the-sobering-truth-i-learned-about-the-hidden-system-that-traps-us-all/"&gt;left my corporate career to build conscious businesses&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I was choosing freedom. But I'd just traded one identity prison for another. I became so invested in being "the guy who escaped the system" that I couldn't honestly assess when my new ventures weren't working. Admitting failure felt like admitting I was a fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what psychologists call "identity fusion"—when the boundary between self and group dissolves, when challenging the belief feels like threatening the self. It creates a kind of anxious attachment where any flexibility feels like existential danger. You can't be wrong about anything significant because being wrong means you might not be who you think you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started noticing this everywhere in my work. The meditation teacher who couldn't admit she was depressed because spiritual people are supposed to be at peace. The zero-waste advocate who hoarded glass jars in secret shame. The productivity guru whose life was chaos but couldn't say so without destroying his brand—and his sense of self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I met Brazilian shaman Rudá Iandê in 2014, he helped me understand something crucial: most suffering comes not from our circumstances, but from our rigid identification with temporary states. We think we need to be consistent, to have a solid sense of self. But what if that very solidity is what's strangling us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with Rudá to help him launch &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/sp/out-of-the-box/"&gt;programs like "Out of the Box"&lt;/a&gt; showed me that the people who suffer most are often the ones with the strongest moral convictions. They care so much about doing right that they lose touch with what actually serves their wellbeing. They become more committed to the purity of their positions than to the effectiveness of their choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern isn't just creating individual misery—it's fracturing our collective ability to solve problems. When your identity depends on being "the environmentalist" or "the conservative" or "the progressive," you become psychologically invested in being right rather than getting things right. You can't adapt your strategies based on evidence because your strategies have become you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at our political discourse. People can't change their minds about anything significant without feeling like they're committing intellectual suicide. Climate activists can't acknowledge when certain approaches aren't working. Business leaders can't pivot failing strategies. Parents can't adjust philosophies that aren't serving their families. &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/jus-10-signs-of-a-truly-independent-thinker-according-to-psychology/"&gt;We've lost the capacity for independent thinking&lt;/a&gt; because we've confused intellectual positions with personal essence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's another way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call it "fluid integrity"—the capacity to hold your values deeply enough that you're not blown around by every cultural wind, yet lightly enough that you can evolve them without losing yourself. It means understanding that you are the space in which beliefs arise and pass away, not the beliefs themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone with fluid integrity might remain deeply committed to reducing animal suffering while being honest about personal health struggles. They might care passionately about environmental protection while being willing to question which specific approaches work best. They hold their convictions as tools for engaging with reality, not as monuments to their moral worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about becoming wishy-washy or abandoning your principles. It's about recognizing the difference between commitment and attachment. Commitment serves your values; attachment serves your ego's need for certainty. Commitment adapts to circumstances; attachment defends against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about Marcus, a guy who reached out after reading my veganism piece. He'd been plant-based for five years and loved it—until he developed severe anemia that wasn't responding to supplementation. Instead of quietly adding animal products and suffering in shame, he posted honestly in his vegan community about needing to temporarily include some fish for his health. "I'm still committed to minimizing animal suffering," he wrote, "and right now that includes not sacrificing my own wellbeing."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half the group attacked him. But the other half thanked him for his honesty, and several admitted they'd been struggling with similar issues in silence. That's what fluid integrity looks like: &lt;a href="https://thevessel.io/jus-7-ways-to-tell-if-someone-forms-their-own-opinions-or-just-repeats-what-theyve-heard-elsewhere/"&gt;the courage to prioritize truth over tribal belonging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice starts with a simple recognition: every identity you cling to is provisional. "I am vegan" becomes "I currently choose plant-based eating because it aligns with my values." "I am an entrepreneur" becomes "I am currently building a business as one expression of my creativity." "I am spiritual" becomes "I am currently exploring practices that deepen my sense of connection."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't semantic game-playing. It's psychological freedom. When you hold your identities lightly, you can respond to life as it unfolds rather than defending against it. You can be wrong without being worthless. You can change without losing yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is that people with fluid integrity often become more principled, not less. When your principles serve your growth rather than constraining it, they become more powerful tools for engagement. When you're not defending your beliefs, you can actually live them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch this transformation in people who go through our programs at The Vessel. They don't become less passionate or committed. They become more creative, more resilient, more effective. They stop fighting against reality and start dancing with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back at those Instagram messages, I realize they were all variations of the same cry: "I thought this identity would save me, but it's suffocating me instead." Veganism, fitness culture, political movements, spiritual practices, career paths—we've turned them all into identity prisons because we're terrified of the space between who we were and who we're becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that space isn't empty. It's where growth happens. It's where real choice lives. It's where you remember that you are not your beliefs—you are the awareness that chooses them, questions them, and when necessary, transcends them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mental health crisis among vegans is just the tip of the iceberg. Beneath it lies a fundamental confusion about the nature of identity in the modern world. We've been taught to build ourselves out of beliefs, positions, and practices. But we are the builders, not the buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world that profits from our psychological rigidity, fluid integrity is a radical act. It's the foundation of both personal freedom and collective wisdom. And it might just be the key to solving problems that rigid ideologies never could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you feel that familiar anxiety about whether you're being consistent enough, pure enough, committed enough to whatever identity you've adopted, try asking a different question: "What would serve my growth right now?" The answer might surprise you. And that surprise might be exactly what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

The shorter the telomeres, the more worn out your cells are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, here’s where it gets cool: Researchers looked at data from the well-known VITAL study—a long-term clinical trial where participants were randomly given either vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day), omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/day), or a placebo. The telomere sub-study followed over 1,000 people (women 55+ and men 50+) for up to four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results? Those taking vitamin D had significantly less telomere shortening compared to those on placebo. In fact, vitamin D slowed the rate of cellular aging by what would’ve been the equivalent of nearly three years! That’s a pretty big deal when you're trying to keep your cells (and yourself) feeling young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s, on the other hand, didn’t seem to make much of a difference in this case—at least not for telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is always welcome, this study adds to growing evidence that vitamin D does more than just support your bones and immunity. It may also be quietly working behind the scenes to keep your cells younger, longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, the principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Michael and Lee Bell Professor of Women’s Health at Harvard Medical School. “This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease,” said Manson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is one of those nutrients that quietly does a ton of important stuff in your body—and most of us don’t even realize we’re running low on it. Nicknamed the “sunshine vitamin” because your body makes it when sunlight hits your skin, vitamin D helps your bones stay strong by making sure you absorb enough calcium. Without it, your bones can get weak, brittle, and way more prone to breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s just the beginning. Vitamin D also supports your immune system—so you're better equipped to fight off colds, flu, and even chronic inflammation. Some studies say it may help improve your mood, too, and there’s growing research linking low vitamin D to issues like depression, fatigue, and brain fog. The catch? A lot of us don’t get enough sun, especially if we’re indoors all day or live in cloudy places. That’s where food and supplements come in—fatty fish, egg yolks, fortified milk, or a daily D3 capsule can help fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t ghost your vitamin D. So if you’ve been slacking on your vitamin D intake (especially if you're not getting much sun), this might be the nudge you needed to start adding it to your daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 02:22:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi7gFBVV95cUxQc2NqdGpOc0pacm83LVRhMGZ4ck9zWm5TNW5RdWM3U0QzSGZHVy1DZjhUaVFGeWZVZng0V0hiemlTOUxGMVVJT092OG9fczVCSVdqTDRwRjJXeWhoNUJaTWd5SDA4OUtfV0trUXR6OTFhUXl4RngwZHFraXpORzBFemNIbW4wOVBkY1Fyek80c2phalozWE1SYzIxY1g2TGJORVV0RDRqdXVUMUFfYWZKaS11ZGlFeV9RRS1ZR0QtNXJzOHZGN2xyQjFuZXotUnpEV2k3UVM1M1JYWlBjQWM4Y2ZYeUN3cVB3S3ZDejF3</guid></item><item><title>长寿的人分享非常重要的血液生物标志物，为科学家提供抗衰老提示- Earth.com | Long-lived people share very crucial blood biomarkers, giving scientists anti-aging hints - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxOT19qNDRjX2hwLXk3bnBPWjdGUWppZG1HQkxXNkh4ZFNRTTZFdEJ5ZFNXSkZyTjBFaDNUb3dFVDFnYlpoaTJBb1B6ellNMWtnSW9LNWxHMk1HQk1YM2JPNHdPS2Z5Q2ZpX2xZelJRSGZoVmtuRmNwb0JocVpqeHZTZFlweGVwNWIyM0NDckZCaWRXXzBhRnQ0dTJzZlVkRVgzdHoyYUQtenFTd1NwT0NPdFRVdlZHS0Jrb1JLVU1nQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few generations, the idea of celebrating a 100th birthday has moved from fairy-tale territory to neighborhood reality. Centenarians are now the fastest-growing age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their ranks have doubled roughly every ten years since 1950, and projections point to a fivefold jump between 2022 and 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those soaring numbers spark a simple question: why do some bodies last so much longer than others? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers keep circling back to the familiar duet of genetics and daily habits – food, activity, stress management – but the details are still fuzzy enough to make any doctor shrug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-for-common-threads"&gt;Looking for common threads&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That puzzle motivated a team at &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt;, writing in &lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;, to follow 44,000 Swedes aged 64–99 whose blood had been tested decades ago in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28158674/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AMORIS cohort&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them, 1,224 – about 2.7 percent – lived to 100, and a striking 85 percent of that group were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-anti-aging-drug-interleukin-11-boosts-lifespan-prevents-cancer-gray-hair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gray hair&lt;/a&gt; and walking sticks, these future centenarians were already standing out. Hospital stays were rarer, memory stayed sharper, and routine lab work hinted at bodies aging at a slower clip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exceptional longevity, it turns out, often traces back to midlife, not just the final lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sharing-blood-biomarkers"&gt;Sharing blood biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors lean on “biomarkers” – chemical snapshots that reveal how hard organs are working. Inflammation markers often climb with age; in one Japanese study, people with the lowest inflammation were more likely to reach 100. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar patterns keep popping up for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/the-power-of-fish-oil-in-combating-high-cholesterol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-a-cellular-switch-mitochondria-that-could-reverse-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, and kidney-related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing matters. Snapshots taken at a single clinic visit, known as a “cross-sectional study,” can’t untangle cause from consequence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are good numbers protecting you, or are they simply the fingerprint of slower aging? Longitudinal records are needed to see which comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-invaluable-data-from-sweden"&gt;Invaluable data from Sweden&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because AMORIS records stretched back 35 years, the Karolinska group could watch trends instead of single frames. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They combed through twelve blood-based indicators tied to &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-metabolism-has-evolved-to-become-energetically-unique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, liver and kidney function, nutrition, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fasting-helps-the-body-fight-inflammation-and-chronic-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future centenarians cruised through their sixties with lower glucose, creatinine, and uric acid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extreme readings were rare: almost none logged a glucose level above 6.5 mmol/L or a creatinine value over 125 µmol/L. In plain terms, sugar control and kidney metrics stayed firmly in the middle lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-small-numbers-big-weight"&gt;Small numbers, big weight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When participants were sorted into five groups for each biomarker, patterns starting popping out. Folks in the lowest bracket for total cholesterol and iron were less likely to hit 100 than those sitting midrange or higher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, creeping levels of biomarkers like glucose, creatinine, uric acid, and several &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brushing-your-teeth-regularly-can-prevent-deadly-liver-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;liver enzymes&lt;/a&gt; quietly clipped the odds of joining the century club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003476.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Uric acid&lt;/a&gt; told perhaps the clearest story. In the group with the most modest readings, 4 percent reached triple digits; in the highest group, only 1.5 percent did. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A gap of 2.5 percentage points may look small, yet across whole populations it translates to thousands of extra birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-different-paths-to-the-same-biomarkers"&gt;Different paths to the same biomarkers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies from Italy, Denmark, and Germany underline that not every centenarian walks the same path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some arrive at their milestone spry enough to garden all morning; others are frailer and juggling multiple health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish team now hopes to see whether those divergent futures were already written in the early bloodwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the split is more than academic. Public-health planners need to know how many elders will require intensive care versus those likely to stay independent, and families want clearer hints about what to expect in their own later chapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-lifestyle-luck"&gt;Genes, lifestyle, luck&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study cannot pin tidy lab values on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-benefits-of-the-mediterranean-diet-can-be-boosted-with-more-greens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kale salads&lt;/a&gt; or rare stretches of DNA. It does, however, underline that metabolism and organ health matter long before retirement parties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family traits, food choices, alcohol habits, exercise, and plain chance all swirl together to shape those lab slips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observations from so-called &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/blue-zone-diets-reduce-the-risk-of-severe-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blue Zones&lt;/a&gt; – pockets such as Okinawa and Sardinia where nonagenarians crowd the village square – echo the Swedish findings: modest meals, steady activity, and low chronic inflammation often travel together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-biomarkers-and-longevity-science"&gt;Biomarkers and longevity science&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are gearing up to layer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meet-the-pangenome-the-clearest-snapshot-ever-taken-of-human-genomic-diversity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;genetic sequencing&lt;/a&gt; on top of old blood records, hunting for variants that might keep organs humming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models, trained on decades of biomarker data, could soon flag people at risk of a rougher aging course while there’s still plenty of time to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big picture, the goal is to shift medicine’s focus from chasing disease to stretching healthspan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If early lab signs can predict who will thrive into their nineties, doctors could use the information to tweak treatment targets decades ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-start-building-biomarkers-now"&gt;Start building biomarkers now&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;No blood test guarantees a telegram from the White House, yet keeping tabs on kidney and liver enzymes, fasting glucose, and uric acid as the years roll by can offer early warning lights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small tweaks – longer walks, fewer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sugary-drinks-linked-to-millions-of-diabetes-and-heart-disease-cases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sugary drinks&lt;/a&gt;, varied protein, mindful stress relief – nudge those numbers toward the safer middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should you find yourself blowing out 100 candles one June evening, remember that the path likely started long before AARP mailers first hit the doorstep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balanced metrics in midlife appear to set the stage for a longer, healthier encore that keeps both brain and body in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00936-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GeroScience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 02:16:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxOT19qNDRjX2hwLXk3bnBPWjdGUWppZG1HQkxXNkh4ZFNRTTZFdEJ5ZFNXSkZyTjBFaDNUb3dFVDFnYlpoaTJBb1B6ellNMWtnSW9LNWxHMk1HQk1YM2JPNHdPS2Z5Q2ZpX2xZelJRSGZoVmtuRmNwb0JocVpqeHZTZFlweGVwNWIyM0NDckZCaWRXXzBhRnQ0dTJzZlVkRVgzdHoyYUQtenFTd1NwT0NPdFRVdlZHS0Jrb1JLVU1nQQ</guid></item><item><title>黑客T细胞治疗乳糜泻- Hackaday | Hacking T Cells To Treat Celiac Disease - Hackaday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE50RHB5VnpEcUYxRjM3RkV5NmpsS0NvZ2pmYUV5LVVJSms3VFpZVUtDVVNMSmZlcDYyNEZCZm11ZE8tTmJRbGhVUER3bl9PMUl3dkxkTlRabUYyakxMQ1F6NGkwQWdFWGJCNFdfaFRGTTQyNEZZRDJLdnFPZ3I?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article" id="post-784914" class="post-784914 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-medical-hacks tag-autoimmune-disease tag-autoimmunity tag-disease tag-immune-system tag-medical-hacks"&gt;
    

    &lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As there is no cure for celiac disease, people must stick to a gluten free diet to remain symptom-free. While this has become easier in recent years, scientists have found some &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr8941" target="_blank"&gt;promising results in mice&lt;/a&gt; for disabling the disease. [via &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experimental-therapy-suppresses-immune-reaction-to-gluten-in-mice" target="_blank"&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since celiac is an auto-immune disorder, finding ways to alter the immune response to gluten is one area of investigation to alleviate the symptoms of the disease. Using a so-called “inverse vaccine,” researchers “engineered regulatory T cells (eT&lt;sub&gt;regs&lt;/sub&gt;) modified to orthotopically express T cell receptors specific to gluten peptides could quiet gluten-reactive effector T cells.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason these are called “inverse vaccines” is that, unlike a traditional vaccine that turns up the immune response to a given stimuli, this does the opposite. When the scientists tried the technique with transgenic mice, the mice exhibited resistance to the typical effects of the target gluten antigen and a related type on the digestive system. As with much research, there is still a lot of work to do, including testing resistance to other types of gluten and whether there are still long-term deleterious effects on true celiac digestive systems as the transgenic mice only had HLA-DQ2.5 reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds vaguely familiar, we covered &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/09/25/inverse-vaccines-could-help-treat-autoimmune-conditions/"&gt;“inverse vaccines”&lt;/a&gt; in more detail previously.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3200132/"&gt;Appendix cancer&lt;/a&gt; is a condition that, until recently, was so rare that most people never gave it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, it was the kind of disease that doctors might encounter only once or twice in a career, and it was almost always found in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/appendix-cancers-rise-younger-generations-study-finds-rcna211796"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; a surprising and concerning trend is emerging: &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;appendix cancer is being diagnosed more often&lt;/a&gt;, and it's increasingly affecting people in their 30s, 40s and even younger. This shift has left many experts puzzled and searching for answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine. Its purpose in the body is &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Why-do-Humans-have-an-Appendix.aspx"&gt;still debated&lt;/a&gt;, but it's best known for causing appendicitis, a painful inflammation that often requires emergency surgery. What's less well known is that  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="164404" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; can develop in the appendix, usually without any warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-02479"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, has shown that the number of appendix cancer cases has increased dramatically among people born after the 1970s. In fact, the incidence has tripled or even quadrupled in younger generations compared with those born in the 1940s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the overall numbers are still small (appendix cancer affects just a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9418812/#:%7E:text=Overall%2C%20the%20incidence%20of%20appendiceal,5.1%20to%2011.2%20per%20cent."&gt;handful of people&lt;/a&gt; per million each year) the rapid rise is striking. Even more notable is that about one in three cases now occurs in adults under 50, a much higher proportion than seen in other types of gastrointestinal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what's behind this surge? &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/health-and-wellbeing/vitamin-d-colon-cancer-b2744234.html"&gt;No one knows for sure&lt;/a&gt;, but one of the first suspects is the dramatic change in lifestyle and environment over the past several decades. Obesity rates have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3543235/"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; since the 1970s, and being overweight is a known risk factor for many cancers, including those of the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, diets have shifted toward more processed foods, sugary drinks, and red or processed meats, all of which have been linked to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/king-charles-is-changing-his-diet-to-keep-his-cancer-at-bay-heres-what-the-evidence-says-245582"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; in other &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-eating-yoghurt-regularly-could-lower-your-risk-of-bowel-cancer-251942"&gt;parts of the gut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity has also &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt;, with more people spending long hours sitting at desks or in front of screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another possibility is that we are being exposed to new environmental factors that previous generations didn't face. The industrialisation of food production, the widespread use of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39518141/"&gt;plastics and chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, and changes in water quality might all play a role. However, the evidence is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hard to detect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes appendix cancer especially challenging is how difficult it is to detect. Unlike colon cancer, which can sometimes be found early through screening colonoscopies, appendix cancer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33094592/"&gt;usually flies under the radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The symptoms, if they appear at all, are vague and easy to dismiss. People might experience mild abdominal pain, bloating or changes in bowel habits, which are common complaints for many benign conditions. As a result, most cases are only discovered after surgery for suspected appendicitis, when it's often too late for early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the rise in cases, there is no routine screening test for appendix cancer. The disease is simply too rare to justify widespread screening, and the appendix can be difficult to visualise with standard imaging or endoscopy. This means that both patients and doctors need to be extra vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone experiences persistent or unusual abdominal symptoms, especially if they're under 50, it's important not to ignore them. Early investigation and prompt treatment can make a significant difference in outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in appendix cancer among younger adults is part of a broader trend seen in other gastrointestinal cancers, such as those of the colon and stomach. These cancers, too, are being diagnosed more often in people under 50, suggesting that shared risk factors may be at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons for this shift are complex and probably involve a mix of genetics, lifestyle, environment and perhaps even changes in our &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bug-drugs-bacteria-based-cancer-therapies-are-finally-overcoming-barriers-251278"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; – the bacteria in our intestines that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39882224/"&gt;live with us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, antibiotics have been used more frequently, both in medicine and in agriculture. This widespread use can alter the balance of bacteria in our guts, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7916407/"&gt;might influence cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some recent research suggests that early-life exposure to antibiotics could have &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;long-term effects on the digestive system&lt;/a&gt;, but more studies are needed to confirm this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg" alt="Different types of tablets or pills in foil packs" class="size-full wp-image-164410" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-484x415.jpg 484w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/AntibioticTabletsInPackaging-600x514.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164410" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Could early-life exposure to antibiotics have something to do with the rise in appendix cancer? (PublicDomainPictures/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the best advice is to focus on prevention and awareness. Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet rich in fruit, vegetables and whole grains, and staying physically active are all steps that can lower the risk of many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol intake are also &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;important&lt;/a&gt;. While these measures can't guarantee protection against appendix cancer, they are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;proven strategies&lt;/a&gt; for overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are working hard to unravel the mystery of why appendix cancer is rising so rapidly among younger generations. Understanding the causes will be crucial for developing better ways to prevent, detect and treat this rare but increasingly important disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, raising awareness among healthcare providers and the public is essential. By recognising the signs and taking action when symptoms arise, we can improve the chances of catching appendix cancer early and giving patients the best possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of appendix cancer's rise is a reminder that even rare diseases can become more common when our environment and lifestyles change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also a call to action for further research and for all of us to pay attention to our bodies, seek medical advice when something feels off, and support efforts to understand and combat this puzzling trend.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258607/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

A new study suggests that these common medications might ease the mental decline linked with this devastating condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the &lt;a href="https://ki.se/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Karolinska Institutet&lt;/a&gt; found a compelling connection between statin use and slower cognitive deterioration. Their findings, recently published in &lt;a href="https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-023-01360-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer Research and Therapy&lt;/a&gt;, offer cautious optimism for a disease that affects millions worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team examined data from a national registry of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia. Those who were taking statins experienced a gentler decline in thinking ability than those who weren’t on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Statins, long hailed for lowering cholesterol, might offer an unexpected benefit beyond heart health.

Because the research was observational, it can’t prove that &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/common-cholesterol-drugs-could-stop-cancer-growth/"&gt;statins&lt;/a&gt; directly cause the slower decline. Still, the pattern they saw raises important questions worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controlled clinical trials will be essential to confirm whether statins truly offer this cognitive shield. Until then, the link remains a promising lead, but not a &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/us-prescription-drug-prices-are-2-78-times-those-in-other-wealthy-nations-study-finds/"&gt;prescription-ready&lt;/a&gt; solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, doctors have been wary of giving statins to people with dementia. Concerns over side effects—particularly confusion—have made many cautious about their use in these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Interaction between the patient’s and medication’s characteristics potentially influence the cognitive effects of statins. Two separate cholesterol pools in the body are thought to be connected to the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), central and peripheral. (CREDIT: Alzheimer Research and Therapy) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this new data may shift that thinking. “People with &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/breakthrough-study-reveals-the-cause-of-alzheimers-and-dementia/"&gt;Alzheimer’s dementia&lt;/a&gt; treated with statins had better cognitive development over time,” said Sara Garcia-Ptacek, lead author of the study and a professor at a major Swedish university. Her team believes these insights could spark a fresh look at the medications’ role in brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s too early to change treatment guidelines, the evidence opens the door for further research. For now, statins remain a potential ally—one that deserves closer study in the fight against Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="a_promising_but_preliminary_step"&gt;A Promising but Preliminary Step&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the results of this study provide hope, they also highlight the complexity of Alzheimer's disease and the challenges of identifying effective treatments. The potential benefits of statins for certain patients warrant further investigation through rigorous clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the results of the study do not mean that we now have evidence that people with dementia should be treated with statins. But on the other hand, we can't see any support for not doing so. So, if a person needs statins for high &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-study-reveals-the-dietary-secret-to-brain-health-and-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blood lipids&lt;/a&gt;, a dementia diagnosis should not stop the treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study incorporated data from over 15,500 dementia patients who also had indications for lipid-lowering treatment. Among them, nearly 11,000 received statin therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the patients on statins displayed slightly higher cognitive test scores despite having higher rates of conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/breakthrough-research-reveals-the-cause-and-cure-for-high-blood-pressure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes, all of which are established risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia-Ptacek elucidates that their research began with the hypothesis that statins might decelerate dementia progression. They cast a wide net to explore if there was any evidence to substantiate this theory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Cognitive decline, evaluated with change in MMSE score over time, in statin users compared to non-users of statins. The graph shows the association between increasing doses of statin treatment and MMSE over time, as predicted from the model.

Previous clinical studies have explored this idea, but they yielded negative results. Garcia-Ptacek and her team believe that these trials might have been too small to detect significant differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="16" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their approach focuses on pinpointing specific patient groups within the Alzheimer's spectrum that might benefit the most from statin treatment, and understanding why they respond positively. This preliminary study sets the stage for more refined investigations and potential &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-new-vaccine-could-protect-against-all-future-coronavirus-disease-outbreaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;future clinical trials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study hints at the potential benefits of statins in Alzheimer's patients, it serves as a critical stepping stone in unraveling the complex relationship between these drugs and dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Cognitive decline, evaluated with change in MMSE score over time, in simvastatin compared to atorvastatin users.

Until then, cautious optimism remains the prevailing sentiment in the pursuit of a breakthrough in &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discovered-a-significant-link-between-vaccinations-and-alzheimer-s-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer's treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="most_common_types_of_statins_cholesterol_medications_"&gt;Most common types of statins / cholesterol medications:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="19" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atorvastatin (Lipitor): &lt;/strong&gt;This is the most widely used statin and is effective at lowering all &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-reveal-how-and-why-blood-types-evolved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;types of cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.

The process produces the same chalky scale that lines well-used kettles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the experiment, those newborn flakes drifted through the swirling water and latched onto free-floating plastic, wrapping each shard until it sank and knitted itself into the growing crust at the bottom of the pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests on three common resins – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/filter-feeders-transform-microplastics-into-a-bigger-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene&lt;/a&gt; – showed that at least four-fifths of these particles wound up trapped after a five-minute boil and a short cool-down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure climbed near ninety percent when the water held about 300 milligrams of calcium carbonate per liter, a level typical of hard-water regions from San Antonio to Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-minerals-matter"&gt;Why minerals matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water chemistry varies wildly across the United States. In soft water, where dissolved calcium dips below roughly 60 milligrams per liter, the Guangzhou group still recorded a twenty-five percent plastic drop. That is helpful but leaves most debris adrift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard water, by contrast, supplies more building blocks for limescale. The higher the mineral load, the more surfaces form for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/kitchen-germs-are-an-underestimated-threat-to-public-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;plastic to cling to&lt;/a&gt;, so the removal rate rises quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the flakes grow fast, they can be rinsed or brushed away from cookware, taking the microplastics with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any fragments that stay suspended can be caught in a paper coffee filter – an item already parked next to many kitchen sinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method costs pennies, requires no electricity beyond the burner, and fits households that lack space or funds for advanced filtration systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-evidence-outside-the-lab"&gt;Evidence outside the lab&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that everyday heat can curb&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-widespread-in-the-seafood-we-eat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; invisible plastics&lt;/a&gt; meshes with recent field studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, scientists sampling bottled and tap water across Europe tallied anywhere from 19 to 1,154 particles per liter, with the highest counts of microplastics found in municipal supplies drawn from mineral-rich aquifers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By targeting the same minerals, the boiling trick offers a stopgap while policymakers debate stricter water standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies such as the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; state that current data are too thin to draw firm links between microplastic intake and disease, yet they encourage cutting exposure where practical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/environmental-health-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The U.S. Geological Survey&lt;/a&gt;, in its strategic blueprint on environmental health, echoes that stance and calls for simple interventions people can adopt today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-the-kitchen"&gt;Tips for the kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your kettle already furs up between cleanings, you likely benefit most. Bring the water to a rolling boil for five minutes; let it stand until steam subsides, then pour slowly, leaving the whitish crust behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give the kettle a periodic scrub to wash the captured plastics down the drain – &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/microplastics-are-escaping-from-water-treatment-plants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;municipal treatment plants&lt;/a&gt; are better equipped to trap larger, bonded particles than loose nanoscale ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents in soft-water zones can still gain a modest cut by adding food-grade calcium, such as a pinch of pharmaceutical lime, before heating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team cautions that mineral additives should stay within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EPA&lt;/a&gt;) secondary limit of 120 milligrams per liter for calcium to avoid taste issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-boiling-water-vs-microplastics"&gt;Boiling water vs. microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boiling is no silver bullet. Engineers are experimenting with bio-based filters that trap plastic shreds in wastewater plants, while chemists &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-process-converts-microplastics-into-valuable-graphene-wonder-material/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;explore enzymes&lt;/a&gt; that nibble bottles back into harmless molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Guangzhou study shows how an old-school practice can chip away at a modern pollutant without fancy gear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing stovetop heat with a cheap paper filter slashes the largest doses that reach our mugs, even as science hunts for long-term fixes upstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic pollution will not vanish overnight, yet this research reminds us that progress sometimes hides in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Environmental Science and Technology Letters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 23:16:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNTVVMenFFalZHUXV3ZVpseVYyYWIteWJZbHZHMC1HbWltWHdLcEk1MzE5ODRxZmhacVBYSlg1eTBhV09kWW1wMWFkNEU5SEdOZ2FURzA1NzhkRUhodmt5cnpwS3BBd3lfUTQ2b25mbnZKRzZVOWpIckFpTDExWGwzaFBPNDA5eWp4RHpDcEZPanIwSjg</guid></item><item><title>露营者的水箱可能携带严重疾病，以下是修复方法- Autopian | Your Camper’s Water Tank Could Be Carrying Serious Diseases, Here’s How To Fix It - The Autopian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNVzZQamdUUVQ4MWZyZnpfbmxuMW9LSGphd2hQTWxhSUJ4elFkSkluaVRPSEp5azQ3S0RvbjVDTDRfQ19heEM2Q1Izak0xTlFfZDNoZDRBX292bWs0amZpMHJ2OGgtSVRUeUJKZnhKQ1NxMEtvQmRUSnVmZ0FXQkl4c2ROTGQ2UkVqbmJ2M0o5b3RkZjRINWt4anVramdTUlZtV095OUhUUUJZQTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="elementor-widget-container"&gt;
			&lt;p class="mailmunch-forms-before-post"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pretty much RV that’s built some sort of self-contained standard has a tank for fresh water. You fill that tank and can use it for drinking water, showers, and cleaning food. But there can be a hidden danger in your RV’s water tank. If you never clean this tank out, it can be a vessel for serious diseases, possibly even one that could cause your death. Here’s how you can help protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern about the cleanliness of RV freshwater tanks has been raised recently following a May 29 report by the Disease Control and Prevention. The report documents the case of an RV owner who used tap water from their RV for nasal irrigation. This person ended up catching a brain infection, which sadly turned fatal. What the CDC concluded in its investigation is chilling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-contained RV has existed throughout much of camper history. In essence, a self-contained unit is one that is capable of operating away from a source of power, sewer, and water. So, you’ll have a battery or generator for power, holding tanks for your wastes, and a tank for potable water. Some of the earliest motorhomes had self-contained features, and the 1958 Airstream International is often credited as being one of the first truly self-contained travel trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-207844 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa.jpg" alt="Adirondackeaa" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa.jpg 2189w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-768x384.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/adirondackeaa-2048x1024.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2189px) 100vw, 2189px"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These features are critical if you want to use your camper somewhere that’s not an improved campground. Every year, I spend a week with over 40,000 campers at EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, depending on my family’s travel trailer’s water stores, battery, and a generator to be comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sheryl and I have a hard rule to never use the RV’s water tank for internal use. This is because when we first started using the trailer for boondocking at AirVenture in 2023, we learned that there was something horribly wrong with the trailer’s water tank. The tank emitted a foul odor when we filled it, replacing the air inside with water. Then, when we used said water, we found little black particles in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207848" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207848 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash.jpg" alt="Eaawatersplash" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash.jpg 2560w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-300x169.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-768x432.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/eaawatersplash-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207848" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;My family’s 2007 Adirondack violently ejecting a drinking water hose. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family has owned this trailer since 2016, and I asked my parents about the last time they had the tank cleaned. They didn’t even know that was a thing, so it’s safe to assume that it hasn’t been cleaned in &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a decade. If my parents didn’t know that you’re supposed to clean the water tank, how many other Americans are the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Tragic Report&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7419a4.htm"&gt;CDC report&lt;/a&gt; is something of nightmares. Here’s a snippet from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare, often fatal brain infection caused by the free-living ameba, Naegleria fowleri (1). Infection is typically associated with recreational water activities; however, using tap water when performing nasal irrigation is also a risk factor for PAM (2–4). Improperly maintained municipal water and recreational vehicle (RV) water systems can be a source of waterborne disease; CDC recommends the use of distilled, sterile, or boiled and cooled tap water for nasal irrigation.* Household safe water practices can help prevent waterborne illness associated with RV water systems. This report describes a fatal case of N. fowleri infection associated with improper use of a nasal irrigation device with suspected contaminated tap water from an RV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previously healthy woman aged 71 years developed severe neurologic symptoms, including fever, headache, and altered mental status within 4 days of using a nasal irrigation device filled with tap water from an RV’s water system at a campground in Texas. Despite medical treatment for a suspected PAM infection, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died 8 days after symptom onset. Laboratory testing at CDC confirmed the presence of N. fowleri in the patient’s cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An epidemiologic investigation conducted by the Texas Department of State Health Services included a review of the patient’s medical and exposure history. The patient had no recreational exposure to fresh water; however, she had reportedly performed nasal irrigation on several occasions using nonboiled water from the RV potable water faucet during the 4 days before illness onset. This practice suggested two water sources of concern. The first was the RV’s potable water tank, which flowed directly to the faucets and shower when a municipal water connection was unavailable. The tank had been filled with water collected on an unknown date before the patient’s purchase of the RV 3 months earlier. The second potential source of contamination was the municipal water system, which was connected by a hose and water filter to the RV potable water system, bypassing the tank, at the time the patient used it for nasal irrigation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC then tested water from the campground and water from the RV’s tanks. No N. fowleri was found in these samples, but the CDC did find that the total chlorine and monochloramine disinfectant levels in the campground’s tap water were below the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s recommended levels. Combined with a low pH level, the presence of free ammonia, and unequal concentrations of active disinfectant, the CDC concluded that it was possible for pathogens to thrive in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samples from the RV proved to be even worse, with water quality that was lower quality than than recommended for drinking water, let alone water you’re going to shoot up your nose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the CDC couldn’t figure out if the source of the brain infection came from the RV’s tank or the campground’s tap water, and some of the blame might be because the samples were taken 23 days after the patient shot the water up her nose. However, the conclusion was pretty serious, with Texas public health officials and the CDC calling for, among other things, the maintenance of RV water systems and ensuring that municipal water systems are clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so there can be danger in your RV’s water supply. What can you do about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_68494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68494" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-68494 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255.jpg" alt="20230724 192312" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255.jpg 2560w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-300x150.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-768x384.jpg 768w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230724_192312-scaled-e1749676145255-2048x1024.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-68494" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The water filling station at EAA’s Camp Scholler. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is consider where your RV’s water is coming from. Countless campgrounds, especially remote ones, are pulling their water out of a well. As the CDC suggests up there, water straight from a campground’s taps could be dangerous, as the typical person will not know what’s in that water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some campgrounds bring city water into their taps. This water is generally safer and, so long as the delivery system from the campground’s pipes to your RV’s plumbing are clean, then there is less risk here. But even that requires you to assume everything is up to spec. As Joshua Baker of RV dealer Texas RV Guys noted in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/warnings-rv-water-cdc-woman-texas-died-brain-infection/3857106/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC DFW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, campground water systems aren’t well-regulated, either, so you can’t even trust that the government will keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Water Filtration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your first line of defense is a water filtration system. There are tons of these things commercially available and the simplest of these systems is an inline filter. These filters screw right into the line going from your RV to the spigot at the campground. Some folks who infrequently use their RV might use a cheaper filter like a unit from Clear2O. People who are more serious about clean RV water invest in more expensive systems from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.clearsourcerv.com/collections/clearsource-rv-water-filter-systems"&gt;Clearsource&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goblutech.com/collections/rv-water-filter-systems/products/goblutech-ar3-led-uvc-elite-series-0-2-micron-4-stage-rv-water-filtration-purification-system"&gt;Blu Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which can either be used externally or mounted permanently to the RV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people also combine more than one system into one, such as an inline filter outside and another filter mounted to their coach, or two different types of filters outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207852" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207852 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x.jpg" alt="Welcome The Uvc Ar3 3 1080x" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x.jpg 1080w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-300x225.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Welcome_the_UVC_AR3_3_1080x-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207852" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blu Technology AR3 LED UVC High-Flow 4-Stage RV Water Filter – Blu Technology&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea I’ve seen around RV communities is that multiple filters is better and you want to get a filter that drills down to two microns as much as possible. Some folks will employ other measures, including installing a filter directly onto a faucet by tying it onto the feed line in the cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation of an external filter is about as easy as you would expect, and you connect the filter to your water source and then connect the filter to your motorhome. If you have 36 minutes to spare, RV Youtube channel Our Journey In Myles explains one way to set this up while also reviewing a popular RV filtration system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the types of filters get properly nutty. There are sediment filters, which remove larger suspended matter like sand, scale, and clay from the water supply. Then you have carbon filters, which use activated carbon to absorb and remove impurities, including chemicals and organic contaminants. There are also UV-based water filters, which use UV-C to destroy bacteria and viruses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another kind of filter that you’ll find is a gravity filter. These are pretty simple filters that use gravity to pull water through a filter, leaving behind contaminants and cleaner water. A very popular gravity filter among RVers is a &lt;a href="https://www.usaberkeyfilters.com/"&gt;Berkey&lt;/a&gt;; however, it’s notable that you wouldn’t be using one of these to take a shower. Instead, they’re more for getting cleaner drinking water. Some people will use a Berkey for drinking water and an inline filter system for everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207853" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207853 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/91Hc-VgR4TL._AC_SL1500.jpg" alt="91hc Vgr4tl.

&lt;p&gt;Some folks will even buy a reverse osmosis-based water filtration system and plant it on their countertop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that there is no single answer for what kind of filtration system to use. I would recommend joining a forum for your particular model of RV and seeing what others are using with their rigs. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoRVing/comments/b09ggk/just_upgraded_to_a_clearsource_dual_water_filter/"&gt;people swear by&lt;/a&gt; Clearsource equipment, influencers seem to like Blu Technology rigs, and a lot of people are just &lt;a href="https://alliancervowners.com/forum/threads/water-filtration-blu-tech-clear-source-others.2885/"&gt;creating their own&lt;/a&gt; budget filtration systems using parts from the hardware store meant for residential filtration systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure, I’ll be trying out a water filtration system for myself. I’ve been RVing for over two decades, and yet even I’ve made the mistake of not using any real filtration system. That’s how much water quality gets ignored in the RV world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, a water filtration system is really your first line of defense. You also want to make sure that your RV is as clean as possible. Clean water is of little help if it’s getting contaminated by a camper that’s never been cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to clean both your tank and your lines. A commonly cited method for this would be to fill your RV’s tank with a water and bleach solution. A standard guideline is a quarter cup of bleach per 15 gallons of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by draining any water that’s in your RV. Your fresh tank likely has a drain valve on its bottom, and your hot water tank likely has a similar valve. Be sure that your hot water heater is turned off during this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230529_123804-1536x1152.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Your hot water tank might look like this. Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve drained your camper, fill up your fresh tank with the bleach and water mix. One easy way to do this would be similar to putting an additive into your car’s gas tank. Put bleach in first using a funnel, then hit it with your water to mix it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you’re all filled up with bleachy water, turn on every faucet and shower in the trailer, ensuring to turn on the taps for both the cold and hot water. Turn off these faucets and the shower once you smell bleachy water coming out of all of them. Now, let the solution sit and marinate for between five to 10 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/20230727_083647-1536x1152x.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Mercedes Streeter&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you basically want to run the process in reverse. Run your faucets to fill up your waste tanks with the used bleachy water mix. Then, dump your tanks. Now, refill your fresh tank and run the faucets again until you don’t smell bleach anymore. Drain and refill your tank until the bleach has been eliminated. You can probably expect to spend about a day doing this whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not comfortable with bleach or don’t have somewhere to dispose of it (some campgrounds use septic systems), you can also use vinegar or hydrogen peroxide. There are also commercially available tank cleaning products that do a similar job to bleach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_207849" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-207849" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-207849 size-full" src="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880.jpg" alt="Clear2otankfreshwatertank System" srcset="https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880.jpg 1000w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880-300x240.jpg 300w, https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/CLEAR2OTANKFRESHWATERTANK_SYSTEM-e1749676755880-768x614.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-207849" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Clear2O&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most shops recommend sanitizing your RV tank once every three to six months. Doing it with frequency is important because you don’t want mold, bacteria, parasites, algae, and other nasty stuff growing in your tank. Likewise, if you’ll be storing your camper after completing this process, you’ll want to store it with the tank emptied out rather than sitting for months with water just sitting around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even then, many people, myself included, just buy jugs of water to drink out of and use the camper’s water supply only for cleaning and showers. However, admittedly, carrying around gallons of water is annoying. So, a lot of folks will go through the work to create a pretty comprehensive filtration system so that they can drink water from a campground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what you choose with filtration, I highly recommend that, at the very least, you clean out your RV’s water tank regularly. It’s easy to ignore something like this because your tank is out of sight and sometimes out of mind, but for the safety of yourself and your family, take a day out of your busy schedule to make sure your RV is as clean as it can be. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

Study authors also published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Let’s break down what they found.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers drew data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a 30-year study that started in 1985. It included 4,654 adults, almost 55% women, with an average age of 25 when the study began—also called the baseline. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants’ diets were assessed at baseline and again at years seven and 20. Specifically, researchers were looking for the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290373/a-buyers-guide-to-sugar-substitutes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, diet beverages, aspartame and sucralose. Participants were placed into categories, called quintiles, based on their intake of these substances.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers were also looking for diabetes diagnoses over the 30 years of follow-up, of which there were 691 cases. They defined diabetes as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290761/best-time-to-check-blood-glucose-after-meal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, glucose higher than ≥ 200 mg/dL after a glucose tolerance test, A1c higher than 6.5% or the use of diabetes medications at follow-up visits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Statistical analyses were adjusted for certain demographics, including age, sex, race, education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, diet quality and family history of diabetes.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We know it’s important to limit sugar, and beverages sweetened with sugar can be a major contributor of added sugar in our diets. But this study suggests that replacing regular sodas and other sweetened beverages with diet ones may not benefit you in the ways you’re hoping. It also suggests that they may even significantly raise your risk of developing diabetes—exactly the opposite of what you might think.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study didn’t include sugar alcohols, a type of artificial sweetener, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-study-links-erythritol-with-higher-blood-clot-risk-8695390" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that they, too, may pose some risk, including for blood clots, which increase the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;risk of stroke and heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study raises a lot of questions, which is a good thing with research. We still need more information to know if it’s only the artificial sweeteners raising the risk of diabetes, or if it's the combination of artificial sweeteners with other additives in the beverages. We also can’t know for sure if other additives in the drinks increase diabetes risk on their own, or if it’s a combination of the diet drinks and a poor diet. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite all these questions, here’s what we do know. Soda is far from being a whole food, but everything can fit in a varied and balanced eating pattern. Having a soda now and then is probably fine for most people. The key is how regularly you’re taking a soda break.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you lean on your favorite fizzy pop to get you through a mid-afternoon slump, consider replacing it with an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/energizing-nut-free-snack-recipes-8549709" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;energizing snack&lt;/a&gt;, like some nuts and cheese for a mix of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. You could even take a quick walk or do some push-ups against your desk to get your blood pumping. Changing your physiology is one of the quickest ways to change your energy state. And making sure you’re staying well-hydrated and well-fueled may help prevent the slump to begin with. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you like soda for the bubbles, consider replacing it with an unsweetened &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052890/sparkling-water-soda-water-club-soda-seltzer-water-mineral-water-tonic-whats-the-difference/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll get all of the fizz without the additives that soda contains.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests that those who drink high amounts of diet sodas and other diet beverages may significantly increase their risk of diabetes. Soda, whether sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners, may be a delicious option now and then, but should probably not be a regular on anyone’s menu. If you’re a regular soda imbiber, begin replacing one soda a day with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-gut-friendly-soda-is-my-go-to-drink-for-dry-january-8772967" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural beverages&lt;/a&gt;, including water, sparkling water or unsweetened tea. Milk and juice in moderation can work, too, and add essential nutrients. Over time, continue replacing your daily sodas one at a time until you get to the level you feel good with.&lt;br&gt;

Yet, this quiet mineral helps over 300 enzymes do their job, from calming the nervous system to balancing blood sugar levels. Many believe that eating a healthy, balanced diet should naturally provide enough magnesium. But here’s the twist: sometimes, even with all the leafy greens and whole grains on the plate, magnesium levels in the body might still fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;This isn’t just about what goes into the body; it’s also about what stops it from staying. Here are some reasons why magnesium might be slipping away silently, and what can be done to bring it back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gut health might be blocking magnesium's entry&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, the magnesium intake may look perfect. Spinach, nuts, avocados — all there. But if the digestive system isn’t working smoothly, magnesium might not even get absorbed. Gut inflammation, often caused by undiagnosed conditions like IBS or even chronic stress, can quietly damage the intestinal lining. That lining is where magnesium slips into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is, magnesium depends on a healthy gut to be absorbed properly. Even frequent use of antacids or proton-pump inhibitors (often used for acidity) can reduce magnesium absorption over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Restoring gut balance with fermented foods like homemade curd or kanji, and reducing unnecessary medication use can slowly improve magnesium uptake.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

But magnesium and calcium need to be in balance. When calcium dominates, magnesium gets overshadowed and flushed out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is especially true when calcium supplements are taken without proper guidance or blood testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact is, magnesium and calcium share similar absorption pathways in the body. When one floods the system, the other gets left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritising magnesium-rich foods like pumpkin seeds, ragi, or black beans in meals that don’t include heavy dairy or calcium-fortified products can help restore the mineral balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden loss through sweat and stress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one rarely gets the attention it deserves. Excessive sweating, whether through intense workouts or just living in a hot climate, can quietly drain magnesium. But that’s not all. Chronic stress, even if it’s mental, signals the kidneys to flush out more magnesium through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not always visible, but the loss is very real. Magnesium is one of the first minerals to get depleted during stress because the body uses it to calm the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium levels can be supported during periods of physical or mental stress by sipping on nimbu-pani with a pinch of rock salt or adding soaked seeds (like sunflower or pumpkin) to mid-meal snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

In the web-based Big Joy Project, nearly 17,600 participants from around the world performed micro-acts like sharing joyful moments and listing things they’re grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed higher positive emotions, lower stress, and better sleep, especially among younger, Black, Hispanic, and socially disadvantaged individuals. This is the first large-scale study to demonstrate that a short, low-effort intervention can provide meaningful mental and physical health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short &amp;amp; Effective:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a few minutes per day for 7 days improved wellbeing, sleep, and stress levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equity in Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Younger, Black, Hispanic, and disadvantaged groups saw the greatest benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Minimal time commitment means greater accessibility for broader populations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers, led by UC San Francisco, tested the effectiveness of a weeklong, web-based wellbeing intervention, known as the Big Joy Project. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This consisted of daily micro-acts, which included asking someone to share a fun, inspiring, or proud moment, making a gratitude list, and performing a kind act to brighten someone’s day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximately 17,600 people from around the world participated: most were from the United States, Canada and Great Britain (71%), female (84%), white (74%), with at least some college education (94%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What They Discovered:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;After the seven-day intervention, participants reported higher levels of wellbeing and positive emotions, and a stronger belief that one’s own behavior can promote happiness. They also reported decreased stress, and improved health and sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Younger, Black and Hispanic, and socially disadvantaged participants benefited the most.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why It Matters:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improvements in wellbeing are associated with a lower risk of future mental illness and better physical health. “People with higher wellbeing are less likely to develop chronic conditions, like cardiovascular diseases, and have reduced mortality in both healthy and unhealthy populations,” said senior author Elissa Epel, PhD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web-based wellbeing interventions that last several weeks and take 3 to 4 hours a week to complete have shown favorable results. But this is the first time that a short intervention has shown such strong benefits, and it could work for more people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people lack the time, motivation, and resources to commit to these lengthier programs, and they may be more likely to drop out,” said first author Darwin Guevarra, PhD, who is also affiliated with Miami University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were excited to get positive results in a program that required just a few minutes each day for a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding and Disclosures:&lt;/strong&gt; Smith and Callahan are from the nonprofit that partially funded the Big Joy Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this happiness and psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#085b7d726966666d26446d616f60487d6b7b6e266d6c7d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Suzanne Leigh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucsf.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Suzanne Leigh – UCSF&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2196/72053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scaling a Brief Digital Well-Being Intervention (the Big Joy Project) and Sociodemographic Moderators: Single-Group Pre-Post Study&lt;/a&gt;” by Elissa Epel et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Medical Internet Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scaling a Brief Digital Well-Being Intervention (the Big Joy Project) and Sociodemographic Moderators: Single-Group Pre-Post Study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emotional well-being interventions lead to better mental and physical health. However, most of these interventions have been tested on relatively homogeneous samples, with few interventions large enough to examine whether key sociodemographic factors impact outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, barriers to engagement include access and high participant burden. We developed a brief web-based intervention to address these barriers and tested the effects across sociodemographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study aims to examine the effectiveness of a brief, low-burden digital well-being intervention in improving emotional well-being and health-related outcomes across a diverse global sample. It investigates how key sociodemographic factors, such as age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, financial strain, and subjective social status, moderate intervention effects. The goal is to identify which groups benefit most, informing the scalability and public health potential of digital well-being interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a single-group pre-post study spanning from 2022 to 2024 using a web-based, multicomponent, week-long well-being intervention requiring 5 to 10 minutes of daily activity (the Big Joy Project).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a global convenience sample recruited via open web-based enrollment, we assessed pre-post changes in emotional well-being, positive emotions, happiness agency, perceived stress, self-reported health, and sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, participants also reported sociodemographic characteristics. We used mixed-effects linear models to examine pre-post changes in the outcomes and sociodemographic moderators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample (N=17,598) consisted of individuals from 169 countries and territories, with broad representation across sociodemographic groups; however, the sample was predominantly White, female, and had at least a high school or college education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the intervention, participants showed significant within-subjects effect size increases in emotional well-being (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.48; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001), positive emotions (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.45; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001), and happiness agency (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.44; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, participants showed a decrease in perceived stress (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=–0.35; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001) and an increase in self-reported health (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.07; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001) and sleep quality (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=0.15; &lt;em&gt;P&amp;lt;&lt;/em&gt;.001). There was a clear dose-response pattern across outcomes: participants who engaged in more daily practices showed greater improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a strong pattern of social disadvantage moderating these effects, with groups experiencing greater social disadvantage showing larger benefits across most outcomes. For example, those with lower education, greater financial strain, or lower subjective social status and those identifying as individuals from racial or ethnic minority groups (Black or Hispanic) all showed larger improvements across well-being outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, younger people had greater increases in emotional well-being and greater decreases in perceived stress compared to older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brief, low-intensity intervention showed meaningful improvements in well-being and stress, comparable to those seen in longer, more intensive digital well-being interventions. Sociodemographic groups that are at higher risk of poor mental health benefited more from the intervention, highlighting its potential for scalable public health impact. Testing this intervention with a randomized controlled trial design will be important.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 20:04:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5RR3EzSXM0cTJfWTFlekQ1ejkxODVkb3JrN3duMThOSEh1ZU5ud0s4ZTh2eTlfUjE3WkV0MDhCSUl6VWxRY1J6a0JETm9SUDUyRk1LeldCQXVTYXBhaVpOdHRhc1p1b01waXpJemYxTXdvdVY0X0E</guid></item><item><title>新型冠状病毒变异与痛苦的“剃须刀片喉咙”症状有关-旧金山纪事报 | New COVID variant linked to painful ‘razor blade throat’ symptom - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQZDkwSG5Ja1BpTnZrcWcwaU1tSTRiajBrRFNJb0Nzcmc1MUUxRjVZTDFFaHVPV2dfbEY5SHdaVzZ3SUE0Ni1wY2tEZC1kM25IU3FUQ2hwWkhNYWFrUGlxc01zNWZ2eFREVEJkRjE0NC1JSjUycUpqb1hIZGR2anRxek04V0s3RDBQWHJ0aWI4V1Zfei1LRnVEYlphcVlGZEgtcERHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Light particles can also be functionalized to only bind to cancer cells, mitigating damage done to healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The treatment itself is highly targeted because the atoms of dye bind to the receptors on cancer cells while leaving healthy cells largely untouched. It has already shown in followup trials to kill colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The next step will be determining whether this same molecular jackhammer will destroy cancer cells in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This study is about a different way to treat cancer using mechanical forces at the molecular scale,’ said Ciceron Ayala-Orozco, a Rice research scientist who is a lead author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If scaled up to human patients, the treatment's impact could be sweeping. An estimated 1.5 million Americans are living with melanoma, 1.4 million have colorectal cancer, and 300,000 men have prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2025, approximately 316,950 women will be diagnosed with severe, invasive breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The unassuming dye found in hospitals nationwide is a key feature of vibronic-driven action. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After it binds to receptors on melanoma cells, it is assaulted with infrared light, which triggers an earthquake in the cell. The dye atoms begin to vibrate in unison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The dye's electrons sync up into a "plasmon"—a wave of collective motion. This energy couples with the molecule's natural vibrations, making the entire structure shudder at 41 trillion times per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The violent oscillating energy is transferred directly into the cell’s fatty membrane, while nanoscale holes tear open, allowing fluid and foreign molecules to flood in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ciceron Ayala-Orozco, a Rice research scientist who is a lead author on the study, said: ‘This study is about a different way to treat cancer using mechanical forces at the molecular scale'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This fast-moving mechanical force is such that ‘anything around it will be disassembled,’ Ayala-Orozco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cancer cell crumbles as the holes poked in its membrane increase, and dies without further use of any drug or radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Texas team's findings were published in the journal&lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01383-y?fbclid=IwY2xjawK2jK9leHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFHY2NRaWFJQTJzZ2N4VGpHAR5Aubq0u0qi0UftpDThSpHEqFwUsFJdbrc79LRcxVmzWo7-jbquBmS6vERAfA_aem_2ITWKVWZzOfuW0hAJV5Rhw#Sec1"&gt; Nature Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ayala-Orozco said: ‘These molecules are simple dyes that people have been using for a long time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They’re biocompatible, stable in water and very good at attaching themselves to the fatty outer lining of cells. But even though they were being used for imaging, people did not know how to activate these as plasmons.’&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After struggling for years to make blue-light-activated motors work against mouse tumors, Ayala-Orozco turned to explore completely different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started to think that maybe what I needed was not necessarily a motor, but a molecule that absorbs near-infrared light, in the hopes that this molecule could be activated and could move in a different way — not necessarily by rotation,' he told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.healio.com/news/hematology-oncology/20240208/molecular-jackhammers-show-potential-to-kill-cancer-cells-within-minutes"&gt;Healio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘That’s when I started thinking about some molecules called cyanines and started connecting the dots with a property from photophysics called plasmons, which I studied during my PhD to treat cancer. They are activated by near-infrared light. At some point, I decided I had to try this.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The next step will be determining whether this same molecular jackhammer will destroy cancer cells in humans&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows the estimated cancer diagnoses for 2025 by cancer type. Breast, prostate, and lung cancers are expected to be the most common cancers this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When researchers turned their microscopes on other cancer types, they made an exciting discovery: the molecular jackhammers proved just as devastating against prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer cells in petri dishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘No matter which line, we are able to eliminate 100 percent on cell culture,’ Ayala-Orozco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The university will need to partner with a private company to scale up, overcome regulatory hurdles, and enter human trials, ‘hopefully, within 5 to 7 years,’ Ayala-Orozco said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jun 2025 19:59:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxOVUFZUHVUQ2pQeDdSQnBjRFhNZmFlZ3FpTkE0TmVzTnBDVmNPLTk0TlZpbGpad0pwZHJ4eHZ2Mlh6Z0Rtcl9zdHY5aVdvbDFTVHlTNEktX29XYUVzY1gzQnY0bFBTc29FOW5qWkxXcGFtSWh1Ujh3cGVMajZFb2E4SzRpZkFscEJnNGtoOVJ6cW4yUHp4ZVlKeEhROXhBUEg3cVB4VGt2bHRxTjVyMlHSAbMBQVVfeXFMTkNIZDZkb3drdjA4NnZkMm1LdU56RDhtTUJfWmpjOFRmU1ZOMElYMlBCdDNCX2JKeVl1UFV6N1hXTWlkclJNb1JwQThNTmVYaGdIVVh1RThBbWxsaVFuQmNKTzJuVFdoVEZqYUFDWGYyZlZGNnBzVG56VVk5Uklnbzh1c09JV2xlQ0VpUnBSNDZCb2gxR3lKc1NrWnBGdDBLUE1OQlNCZm1GSVdBM0MzU3dzZzg</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，许多COVID患者需要9个月才能恢复基线健康状况- CIDRAP | Many COVID patients needed 9 months to regain baseline well-being, study suggests - CIDRAP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOWGV5bV83cm85YTExc0g5eVM0UUpIdmlWTUM1elQxRzFVSXFJcWNOanE5RWR6eVdsdUZKQVF4T2VlcXp1ZVFBeFF3eS1Ua2Fkb3c5dkNZYXRGREhpOVBhdDBNWDdJNWxfMHdXcnhUUVJWYzhFcEdIQ253OW90dnFEdU1qZ3BSRUM2MDJkcW9tREdKM2Vuakl2bWNHek53eUZjd3NtaFZNT2FfWTZvQVVlSlliUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It took many US COVID-19 survivors who sought treatment for their infection up to 9 months post-infection to return to their baseline sense of mental well-being, while 1 in 5 still had suboptimal quality of life at 1 year, the INSPIRE (Innovative Support for Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infections Registry) Group &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/12/6/ofaf278/8154758?searchresult=1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; yesterday in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Open Forum Infectious Diseases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For the prospective, multicenter registry study, the US investigators used Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 and PROMIS SF-8a questionnaire responses to compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among 1,096 adult COVID-19 survivors and 371 uninfected controls enrolled from December 2020 through August 2022 and followed every 3 months for 1 year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Participants (68.5% women) answered questions on physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, social participation, sleep problems, pain interference, and cognitive function.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical well-being restored first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="Body"&gt;&lt;span&gt;COVID-positive participants reported compromised mental well-being for up to 9 months after infection.

            Karla Dzienkowski’s daughter was 11 when she started coming into her mom’s room at night saying she couldn’t fall asleep because of a stabbing feeling in her legs. She had to walk to make it stop.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh300083b6mx5mf2hw4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The preteen became cranky and tired. Her grades started to slip, and she even fell asleep on a bench during a family trip to an amusement park, Dzienkowski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh300093b6mt0k4o3wa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It took three years, but Dzienkowski’s family finally got an explanation for the girl’s condition: restless legs syndrome.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000a3b6mmmt23kow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One study &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4634567/" target="_blank"&gt;estimates 4% to 29%&lt;/a&gt; of adults in Western industrialized countries have restless legs syndrome. It is a condition that too few people can recognize in themselves, and many doctors don’t know how to manage properly, said Dzienkowski, a nurse who is executive director of the &lt;a href="https://www.rls.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000b3b6m84spvi73@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here is what experts want you to know about restless legs syndrome.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000c3b6matggznnr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder that is characterized by a need to move that is oftentimes associated with an uncomfortable feeling,” said Dr. John Winkelman, chief of the sleep disorders clinical research program at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000d3b6mrhot2gx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The uncomfortable feeling — described as crawling, aching, tingling or throbbing — is often in the legs and sometimes the arms, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000e3b6m6c316hhu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Restlessness frequently happens when people with the condition are sitting or lying down, and it is relieved with movement, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000f3b6mn7db6srf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms are more likely to occur when a person is at rest, most often at night, and because the syndrome interferes with sleep, it is classified as a sleep disorder, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000g3b6m33e49pyd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In moderate to severe cases, people experience restless legs syndrome several times a week, and in the most extreme cases, symptoms can delay sleep for several hours, said Dr. Brian Koo, associate professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine and director of the Yale Center for Restless Legs Syndrome.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000h3b6m6n328n1f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two strong components play a role in who gets restless legs syndrome: genetics and iron levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000i3b6mw03j9m6q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Restless legs syndrome often runs in families, and genetic markers make up about 20% of the prediction of who will get it, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000j3b6min46o9w1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those with an iron deficiency are also more likely to get restless legs syndrome, including people who are pregnant, on dialysis, who are menstruating, who have anemia, or who are vegetarians, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000k3b6mli45roro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants may also be vulnerable to restless legs syndrome, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000l3b6mvslzs6lb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The condition is twice as common in women as in men and much more common as people get older, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000m3b6m0xwl1jdy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, as Dzienkowski learned, children can have restless legs syndrome, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000n3b6mnj5fb3bz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To treat restless legs syndrome, a good first step is to look at what might be making the condition worse, Winkelman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000o3b6m54virq30@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Alcohol, other medications and simple sugars may contribute to symptoms, Koo said.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000p3b6mx6r39dyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If iron is low — or even borderline low — oral iron supplements or intravenous iron infusions may help, Winkelman added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000q3b6m1mca6skv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dzienkowski also recommends having a “bag of tricks” to manage symptoms, such as hot or cold packs, massages, walks or some mind-stimulating activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000r3b6mirzkwupz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For some reason … if you keep your mind engaged, it helps to keep symptoms at bay,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000s3b6m0clqgv97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are medications that help if lifestyle changes and iron supplementation don’t work.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000t3b6mal9fjiv4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many doctors will start with a class of drugs called alpha2-delta ligands, such as gabapentin or pregabalin, Koo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000u3b6mtsrlmj8g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For a long time, dopamine agonists were the first line of medications. But they are now prescribed infrequently because they can worsen restless legs syndrome over time, Winkelman added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000v3b6mklxla3o0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medications for the most severe cases are low-dose, long-acting opioid medications, Koo said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000w3b6mc54fk7w8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have discomfort that motivates you to move your legs at rest — particularly if doing so disturbs your sleep — talk to a doctor, Dzienkowski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000x3b6mg5jqqlqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not all medical professionals are well versed in restless legs syndrome, so asking for a referral to a sleep specialist may be helpful, she said. You should also get your lab work done, especially an iron panel with ferritin, a blood test that looks at how much iron your body has and how available it is for use, Dzienkowski said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbqvpqh3000y3b6mspvf7npm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The sooner you do it, the better, because you’re just delaying diagnosis and treatment, which can be detrimental to your life,” she said. “You don’t realize that that sleepiness that you’re feeling at work or the crankiness or you’re not wanting to get out and do things could be the RLS bleeding into your daytime. …  At least go have that conversation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have unveiled a new device that can be incorporated into menstrual pads and may someday be helpful for screening for diseases like ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The light-weight device looks for disease biomarkers — in this case, measurable levels of specific proteins — in menstrual blood. It includes a paper test strip that changes color when it's exposed to biomarkers of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We imagine this tool to be potentially useful for women at increased risk for cancer," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mavt.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.herrmann.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://mavt.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.herrmann.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Inge Herrmann&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor and leader of the Nanoparticle Systems Engineering Lab at ETH Zurich. She told Live Science that she hopes that the technology may "provide users with an additional monitoring tool" that's cost effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herrmann and her colleagues authored a study about the device that was published in May in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202505170" target="_blank" data-url="https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202505170" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advanced Science&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It has so far been tested with blood from healthy volunteers, so it needs further testing before it can be rolled out as a screening tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-the-device-works-3"&gt;How the device works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device, which measures about an inch squared (2 by 2 centimeters) and is encased in a soft silicone, sits at the bottom of the menstrual pad. The silicone encases the test strip that changes color when exposed to specific proteins. If a biomarker is present, either a line or a circle appears within about 15 minutes of exposure; the darker the color, the more protein is present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say these results can be read by eye, but they have also developed an app that uses a machine learning-driven image analysis to interpret the test. The pad the device is embedded in can be worn for as long as a regular menstrual pads, and as for the device itself, "you can't feel it," Herrmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/new-blood-test-detects-ovarian-cancer-years-before-conventional-methods" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/new-blood-test-detects-ovarian-cancer-years-before-conventional-methods"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New blood test detects ovarian cancer years before conventional methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4W8sR2wSa4CyfmxtiEtSS6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4W8sR2wSa4CyfmxtiEtSS6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers made their initial prototype sensitive to three biomarkers: C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation; carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a "tumor maker" associated with various cancers; and cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), which is specifically associated with ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests exist for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/c-reactive-protein-crp-test/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/c-reactive-protein-crp-test/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;all three&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/cea-test/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/cea-test/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;of these&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ca-125-blood-test-ovarian-cancer/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/lab-tests/ca-125-blood-test-ovarian-cancer/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;biomarkers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: CRP tests monitor inflammation in the body. CEA tests are used to assess how advanced a cancer is or whether treatment is working, but are not used for screening. CA-125 tests can be used to screen for ovarian cancer in people at high risk of the disease, but aren't used for people at average risk because high concentrations can be due to other conditions, including &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34722-endometriosis-causes-symptoms-treatments.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34722-endometriosis-causes-symptoms-treatments.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endometriosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One draw of the new device is that it would be easy for patients to use and less invasive than these existing blood tests, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/paul-blumenthal" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.stanford.edu/paul-blumenthal" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Paul Blumenthal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor emeritus in obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University. Blumenthal was not involved in the new study but has conducted similar research on the clinical potential of menstrual blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the device, the researchers ran tests with venous blood and menstrual blood donated by volunteers to see if it detected similar biomarker concentrations in both types of blood. This included tests in which the scientists "spiked" blood samples with the biomarkers of interest, so they knew exactly how much should be in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared the device's findings with the expected concentrations and also checked its work by assessing those concentrations with clinical chemistry. "There was always good agreement" among these assessments, Herrmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they had volunteers wear the device while on their periods. These individuals reported that, in terms of comfort and wearability, there was "no difference compared to a commercially available sanitary pad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="next-steps-3"&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal says such a tool has clinical potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering ovarian cancer as an example, the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/ovarian-cancer/screening/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/ovarian-cancer/screening/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; notes that there's "no reliable way to screen for ovarian cancer in women who do not have any symptoms." And early symptoms of the disease are similar to those seen during a typical menstrual cycle, such as bloating and lower back pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blumenthal suggested that monitoring CA-125 regularly over time could be a promising way to watch for the disease. "Year after year, let's just say I'm measuring your CA-125, and it's pretty normal," he said. "And one year it sneaks above your level — maybe that's the first indication [that] something is not right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/vagina-on-a-chip" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/vagina-on-a-chip"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists invent 1st 'vagina-on-a-chip'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herrmann also sees the technology as a potential screening tool — a sort of "early warning" detection system particularly for women at a higher genetic risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, one possible issue with the device is that excess blood could get onto the test strip and make its results unreadable, Herrmann said. She also noted that this technology comes with a risk of creating "a lot of stress for users, when an app tells them that there's some deviation, and that they might come to the conclusion that it's cancer." That's a concern that should be taken into account with all tech intended to be used for self-monitoring, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is for researchers to recruit people to use the pad in "real world" conditions and investigate whether it really can provide a medical benefit, Herrmann said. They're now looking to recruit about 100 people for the next round of testing. Depending on how the lab's upcoming research goes and how the product is ultimately regulated, Herrmann believes that it could be available in about three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-4W8sR2wSa4CyfmxtiEtSS6-9eCpoRWPiYPPw5l4lxnncPMuQtOI7WV8" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-4W8sR2wSa4CyfmxtiEtSS6-9eCpoRWPiYPPw5l4lxnncPMuQtOI7WV8 slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year, millions of people in the U.S. get dental implants as a long-term, natural-looking fix for missing teeth. But traditional implants don't fully mimic real teeth.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Tufts University School of Dental Medicine and Tufts University School of Medicine recently described a new approach to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dental+implants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dental implants&lt;/a&gt; that could better replicate how natural teeth feel and function. Their &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99923-8" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, published in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, shows early success with both a "smart" implant and a new gentler surgical technique in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Natural teeth connect to the jawbone through soft tissue rich in nerves, which help sense pressure and texture and guide how we chew and speak. Implants lack that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensory+feedback/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensory feedback&lt;/a&gt;," says Jake Jinkun Chen, DI09, a professor of periodontology and director of the Division of Oral Biology at the School of Dental Medicine and the senior author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional dental implants use a titanium post that fuses directly to the jawbone to support a ceramic crown, and the surgery often cuts or damages nearby nerves. To tie these inert pieces of metal into the body's sensory system, the Tufts team developed an implant wrapped in an innovative biodegradable coating. This coating contains stem cells and a special protein that helps them multiply and turn into nerve tissue. As the coating dissolves during the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healing+process/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healing process&lt;/a&gt;, it releases the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/stem+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt; and protein, fueling the growth of new nerve tissue around the implant.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The coating also contains tiny, rubbery particles that act like memory foam. Compressed so that the implant is smaller than the missing tooth when it's first inserted, these nanofibers gently expand once in place until the implant snugly fits the socket. This allows for a new minimally invasive procedure that preserves existing &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nerve/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nerve&lt;/a&gt; endings in the tissue around the implant.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This new implant and minimally invasive technique should help reconnect nerves, allowing the implant to 'talk' to the brain much like a real tooth," explains Chen. "This breakthrough also could transform other types of bone implants, like those used in hip replacements or fracture repair."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six weeks after surgery, the implants stayed firmly in place in rats, with no signs of inflammation or rejection. "Imaging revealed a distinct space between the implant and the bone, suggesting that the implant had been integrated through soft tissue rather than the traditional fusion with the bone," says Chen. This may restore the nerves around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted by Chen and School of Dental Medicine faculty Qisheng Tu and Zoe Zhu, as well as postdoctoral scholars Siddhartha Das (lead author) and Subhashis Ghosh at Tufts University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These initial results are promising, but it will take more studies and time—for example, research in larger animal models to look at outcomes, including safety and efficacy—before trials can begin in human volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers' next step will be a preclinical study to see if &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; confirms that the new nerves surrounding the prototype implant indeed relay sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Bill Nye, the science educator who’s been a TV mainstay for decades, is not the kind of guy you’d expect would be friends with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the most prominent anti-science kook in the country. But apparently they go way back. And Nye is getting sick of all the texts he’s getting from Kennedy spouting absolute garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye met Kennedy “many years ago,” according to a new profile of The Science Guy in &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a64929773/bill-nye-interview/"&gt;Men’s Health&lt;/a&gt; magazine, after the two men were introduced by actor Ed Begley Jr. to talk about environmental issues. Nye told the magazine that Kennedy, who’s now the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, sends him endless texts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just no self-awareness,” Nye said of Kennedy. “And if you read these articles he sent, they’re all this speculation about autism and just cause-and-effect, and mercury in vaccines, that &lt;em data-node-id="10.1"&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; there’s a connection.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long been an anti-vaccine extremist, working from 2015-2023 as chair of the Children’s Health Defense. The health secretary has previously said “there’s no vaccine that is safe and effective” and has worked to limit access to vaccines, risking the lives of millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye told Men’s Health that he responded to the texts by saying he’d read Kennedy’s book, though it’s not clear which one. Kennedy has contributed to quite a few anti-science screeds, including books like &lt;em&gt;Vax-Unvax: Let the Science Speak&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Wuhan Cover-Up&lt;/em&gt;, and 2021’s &lt;em&gt;The Real Anthony Fauci&lt;/em&gt;. That last one includes a section where Kennedy promotes “miasma theory” and rejects germ theory. Miasma theory was abandoned in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miasma_theory"&gt;19th century&lt;/a&gt;, while the germ theory of disease is foundational to our 21st-century understanding of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease"&gt;how diseases spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye told the magazine that after he got “miles and miles” of texts from Kennedy, he finally said, “Okay, no more texts,” concluding Kennedy simply wasn’t suited for the job he’s holding in the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy is a dangerous lunatic who doesn’t even believe in germ theory. But he’s going to do a lot of damage before he leaves his job. And it’s already happening. Kennedy’s so-called Make America Healthy Again commission issued a report last month that was riddled with errors and cited studies that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-s-make-america-healthy-again-report-cites-fake-studies-2000608850"&gt;don’t exist&lt;/a&gt;. And earlier this week, Kennedy fired all &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-purges-cdcs-vital-vaccine-advisory-committee-2000613732"&gt;17 members&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Those are the folks who help steer the country’s vaccine policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA under Kennedy is also reportedly using AI to help &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/after-slashing-thousands-of-jobs-trumps-fda-wants-to-use-ai-to-approve-new-drugs-more-quickly-2000614144"&gt;approve new drugs&lt;/a&gt;, something that boggles the mind when you remember just how unreliable AI can be. Kennedy has repeatedly touted “&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/rfk-jr-touts-spirituality-as-fix-for-americas-health-problems-2000565002"&gt;spirituality&lt;/a&gt;” as a fix to America’s health crisis, something Trump’s new pick to be Surgeon General has emphasized &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/maga-crackpots-turn-on-trumps-crackpot-surgeon-general-nominee-2000599701"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has long claimed that vaccines cause autism, and promised during a White House event &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/secretary-brain-worm-rfk-jr-tells-trump-well-know-the-cause-of-autism-by-fall-2000587763"&gt;back in April&lt;/a&gt; that he would reveal the “cause” of autism by the fall. Science doesn’t work with that kind of certainty or timetable, announcing the cause of a given disease like you’re unveiling a new Star Wars show before the holidays. But we’re not dealing with serious people, as Trump has taken charge, booting scientific experts in favor of the weirdest people on the planet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Science Guy may try to be diplomatic when it comes to his old friend, “Bobby” Kennedy, as he calls him in the new Men’s Health article. But when even your friends are saying you don’t have “good judgment” in national magazines, something is way off.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In October 2012, one of the largest and most destructive storms to emerge from the Atlantic devastated the US and Caribbean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy"&gt;Hurricane Sandy&lt;/a&gt; left deep scars in affected communities, including the loss of more than 250 lives, tens of billions of dollars in damage, and the less tangible – but still potent – effects of stress, grief, and trauma among survivors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests the hurricane even affected the unborn children of parents who were pregnant when the superstorm hit. And for those who experienced extreme heat as well as storm stress, the effects may have been compounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;To our knowledge, no prior work has examined how exposure to multiple climate-related stressors during pregnancy might work together to shape children's developing brains," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Donato Delngeniis, a neuropsychologist from Queens College in the US who led the investigation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While hurricanes are a regular feature of the Atlantic Ocean weather system, ongoing human emissions of greenhouse gases are changing the climate in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/every-2024-atlantic-hurricane-had-faster-winds-because-of-climate-change/"&gt;intensify hurricane wind speeds&lt;/a&gt;, and exacerbate storm surges – like those that flooded New York City during the hurricane – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22838-1"&gt;by raising sea levels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164293" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937.jpg" alt="aerial photo of an american suburban neighbourhood destroyed by the storm. many grey-roofed houses are askew and destroyed, streets flooded with mud, a few people visible in the bottom left" class="size-full wp-image-164293" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937.jpg 3000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-622x415.jpg 622w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-155085937-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164293" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The devastation of Hurricane Sandy goes beyond physical damage.

This part of the brain coordinates deliberate movement, procedural and conditional learning, habit formation, cognition, and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleven of the kids in this study were in-utero when Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New York, with flood, winds, and ensuing electrical damage destroying homes. The rest were womb-bound either side of the storm, but not during its onslaught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those children who had been exposed to the hurricane in-utero had significantly larger volume in a number of basal ganglia regions, including the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putamen"&gt;putamen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globus_pallidus"&gt;globus pallidus&lt;/a&gt;, which are involved in regulating movement, and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudate_nucleus"&gt;right caudate nucleus&lt;/a&gt;, which is associated with cognitive and motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Despite never personally experiencing these climate events, we are seeing how climate change may be fundamentally altering children's brain development while they are still in the womb," Delngeniis &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;The noticeable increase in children's brain volume could potentially lead to future behavioral disorders."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_164294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164294" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212.jpg" alt="portrait of a woman wearing a fur hood holding a hanky to her face as she walks through a damaged new york queens neighbourhood" class="size-full wp-image-164294" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212.jpg 3000w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/GettyImages-156524212-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-164294" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;For weeks after Hurricane Sandy hit New York City, thousands went without power and heat, adding to the physical stress of the event. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven of the children exposed to Hurricane Sandy, and 17 of those who weren't, were also exposed to extreme heat (at least one day with a temperature above 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) at some point while they were developing in the womb. This allowed the researchers to explore the added dimension of extreme heat exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the scans, extreme heat exposure on its own had no notable effect. But when paired with exposure to the hurricane, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation_(statistics)"&gt;statistical analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealed, extreme heat amplified the adverse effects of hurricane exposure on basal ganglia volume, creating "&lt;span&gt;profound disruptions to the children's developing brains," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; behavioral neuroscientist Yoko Nomura, also from Queens College&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children exposed to both extreme heat and the hurricane tended to have a larger-than-usual left pallidum and a smaller-than-usual left &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleus_accumbens"&gt;nucleus accumbens&lt;/a&gt;, a structure which is considered &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.33588/rn.3009.99617"&gt;the interface between motivation and action&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Given the study's limited sample size and focus on large brain structures, further research would be needed to confirm the findings and determine whether specific stages of development or even sex may play a role in the outcome. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their implications are concerning in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hurricanes-really-are-getting-stronger-and-there-s-a-likely-human-fingerprint"&gt;extreme storms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/even-nasa-cant-explain-the-alarming-surge-in-global-heat-were-seeing"&gt;heat waves&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/places-on-earth-too-hot-for-humans-will-triple-this-century-scientists-warn"&gt;becoming commonplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"These imaging methods enable us to observe how environmental stressors can cascade through a pregnant mother's experience to reshape the structure of a child's developing brain," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/being-pregnant-during-extreme-weather-might-affect-how-bubs-brain-develops"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Ahmed Duke Shereen from City University of New York. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Our findings provide us with compelling evidence that the climate crisis is not merely an environmental crisis – it is a potentially neurological one with consequences for future generations who will inherit our planet."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0324150"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's the first time a regulator &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy" target="_blank"&gt;has confirmed the side effect&lt;/a&gt; following previous &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/17/healthy-returns-ozempic-faces-scrutiny-over-potential-eye-condition-risk.html"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; in Type 2 diabetes patients linking Ozempic to the condition, known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee has asked Novo Nordisk to add the eye condition as a side effect of "very rare" frequency in the product information for drugs that contain semaglutide. That's the active ingredient in Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the latest potential concern about popular GLP-1s such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which mimic gut hormones to regulate blood sugar and tamp down appetite. Demand for the drug class has soared despite hefty price tags and a handful of unpleasant side effects that are most commonly gastrointestinal, such as nausea and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It likely won't be a big concern for the vast majority of patients: the eye condition may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking semaglutide for at least one year, according to the committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee said people with diabetes who are exposed to semaglutide are at a twofold increase in the risk of developing NAION compared with those not taking it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye condition is the second-most common cause of blindness due to optic nerve damage, after glaucoma. It is characterized by vision loss due to decreased blood flow to the front part of the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. The disease typically occurs without any pain and most commonly affects people ages 50 and above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committee said patients should stop treatment with semaglutide products if they experience the side effect. Since December, it has been reviewing &lt;a href="https://laegemiddelstyrelsen.dk/en/news/2024/suspicion-of-rare-eye-condition-from-ozempic-use-to-be-investigated-further/" target="_blank"&gt;the findings&lt;/a&gt; of two Danish &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.09.24318574v1.full.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; linking Ozempic to the condition in diabetes patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Novo Nordisk said it has concluded that the data "did not suggest a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between semaglutide and NAION." The company said the benefits of semaglutide still outweigh its risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the drugmaker said it will collaborate with the EMA to update the labels for semaglutide products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day before the committee's statement, GLP-1s faced scrutiny over another potential eye-related side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2834964?guestAccessKey=6090e38f-93ad-448f-aaff-ef4768286c5d&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;amp;utm_term=060525" target="_blank"&gt;published &lt;/a&gt;Thursday in JAMA Ophthalmology and conducted by University of Toronto researchers, found that diabetes patients who use GLP-1 drugs were twice as likely to develop neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) compared to those who don't take the medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that the longer patients were treated with these medications, the greater their risk of developing nAMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;nAMD, commonly known as "wet" AMD, is the less common but more aggressive form of age-related macular degeneration. It is the leading cause of irreversible vision loss among older adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers drew on health records from Ontario, Canada. They analyzed nearly 140,000 adults with Type 2 diabetes to investigate a possible link between GLP-1 use and wet AMD. In the vast majority of cases, patients received semaglutide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk said semaglutide's "efficacy and safety have been extensively demonstrated in people with obesity/overweight with robust evidence for improving health outcomes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Here are the health tech companies that made CNBC's Disruptor 50 List&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html"&gt;2025 CNBC Disruptor 50&lt;/a&gt; list is here, and a number of health tech startups including Transcarent, Abridge and Rad AI made the cut this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Disruptor 50 designation is a ranked list of innovative private companies that are advancing breakthrough technology within their sector. Any private, independently owned startups that were founded after Jan. 1, 2010 were able to be nominated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nominated companies had to submit qualitative information, like descriptions of their core business model, which were assessed by a team of CNBC editorial staff. They also had to submit quantitative data, like sales and user numbers, which were evaluated by CNBC's Disruptor 50 Advisory Board and Disruptor 50 VC Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the health tech companies that earned a spot this year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#14: Transcarent.&lt;/strong&gt; Founded by longtime health-care executive Glen Tullman in 2020, Transcarent helps workers quickly access care and navigate benefits. The company has raised $940 million in total funding at a $3 billion valuation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#17: Virta Health.&lt;/strong&gt; Sami Inkinen (CEO), Stephen Phinney and Jeff Volek founded Virta Health in 2014. The startup helps patients manage diabetes and obesity, and it has raised $364.5 million at a $2.1 billion valuation, according to PitchBook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#23: Oura.&lt;/strong&gt; This smart ring-maker has raised $200 million at a $5.2 billion valuation. The company was founded by Petteri Lahtela, Kari Kivelä and Markku Koskela and launched in 2013. The consumer and wearable technology company is now led by Tom Hale.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#26: Iambic Therapeutics.&lt;/strong&gt; Founded by Tom Miller (CEO) and Fred Manby, Iambic Therapeutics uses artificial intelligence to accelerate the pace of drug discovery and development. The company launched in 2020 and has raised $220 million.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#37: Formation Bio.&lt;/strong&gt; Benjamine Liu (CEO) and Linhao Zhang founded Formation Bio in 2016. The company uses AI to accelerate the clinical development of promising drug candidates. It has raised $600 million at a $1.7 billion valuation, according to PitchBook.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#41: Rad AI.&lt;/strong&gt; This startup uses generative AI to save radiologists time and enhance productivity. Doktor Gurson (CEO) and Jeff Chang founded the company in 2018. Rad AI has raised $143 million in funding at a $528 million valuation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#43: ElevateBio.&lt;/strong&gt; David Hallal, Vikas Sinha and Mitchell Finer founded the genetic medicines company ElevateBio in 2017. The company has raised $1.3 billion and is now led by Ger Brophy. ElevateBio is advancing treatments for cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and other conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#47: Abridge.&lt;/strong&gt; This startup uses generative AI to automate the clinical documentation that doctors and nurses&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;handle. Founded by Dr. Shiv Rao (CEO) and Zack Lipton in 2018, Abridge has raised $462.5 million at a $2.7 billion valuation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps unsurprisingly, some of the major players in AI took the top five spots on this year's list. Anduril, an autonomous defense company, earned the first spot, followed by OpenAI, Databricks, Anthropic and the design platform Canva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these five companies have a combined valuation of just under $500 billion, which is more than the combined total valuation of almost every past Disruptor 50 list of the last 12 years. A sign of the times, no doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the full Disruptor 50 List &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/10/2025-cnbc-disruptor-50-see-the-full-list-of-companies.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
