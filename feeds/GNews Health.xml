						&lt;p&gt;Someone with measles last week traveled through terminal two
of Raleigh-Durham International Airport while infected, according to the state
and Wake County.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services
[DHHS] said the person lives in another state.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious disease and it spreads
quickly in children and adults who are not vaccinated," said State
Epidemiologist Zack Moore. "All North Carolinians should ensure that they
and their families are up to date on their MMR vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The person arrived in the early morning of Dec. 10 at the
terminal, according to the DHHS.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;There is no known health risk at the Raleigh-Durham
International Airport as of Wednesday, according to the state.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Public health leaders are recommending all unvaccinated
individuals ages 1 year and older receive measles vaccination to protect
themselves and those around them. Measles vaccine is also recommended for
infants 6-11 months who will be traveling internationally or to areas with
active measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Any person that was in terminal 2 between 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.
on Wednesday, Dec. 10 could have been exposed to measles and should monitor for
measles-like symptoms until Jan. 1, 2026. The state also urges anyone there to &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ncdhhs.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58ec19aaea4630b1baad0e5e4&amp;amp;id=e6db9e9c41&amp;amp;e=00ecd6c0b8__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!E1F1tNNYg0x5orCc-_-U5yI4Q7JlFsXwLVlYfxtXDcJ18UHnX9pHgzDSDQTo2_FiVAVR7zsa2jU4hQ$"&gt;contact
their local health department&lt;/a&gt; with any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 9, 2025, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention has reported 1,912 people from 43 states as confirmed measles cases
this year. This is the highest number of measles cases reported in the U.S.
since the second dose of MMR vaccine became widely used in the early 1990s. No
cases of measles have been identified in North Carolina residents in 2025,
though a confirmed case was identified in June in a child who traveled to North
Carolina from another country where measles outbreaks had recently been
reported.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory disease that is spread through the
air by coughing and sneezing. It can also be transmitted through contact with
secretions from the nose or mouth of an infected person. The virus can live for
up to two hours in the air where the infected person was present. Symptoms of
measles usually begin seven to 14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21
days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to more than 104 degrees)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) two to three days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on face, spreads to trunk, arms and legs three to five days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Measles can lead to severe complications like pneumonia and
encephalitis, especially in young children. Globally, measles killed
approximately 95,000 people in 2024, with most of those being unvaccinated
children 5 and under. This number has dropped 88% since 2000 thanks to
vaccination efforts, meaning measles vaccines saved nearly 59 million lives
since that time.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Vaccinations are safe, effective and remain the best way to
prevent serious illness, hospitalization, and death from respiratory viral
infections and from vaccine-preventable infections like measles. Measles can be
prevented by the combination MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ncdhhs.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=58ec19aaea4630b1baad0e5e4&amp;amp;id=73eee22f8e&amp;amp;e=00ecd6c0b8__;!!M5erwxGTI6mlTHJSECWB8LY!E1F1tNNYg0x5orCc-_-U5yI4Q7JlFsXwLVlYfxtXDcJ18UHnX9pHgzDSDQTo2_FiVAVR7zvEVZIDWQ$"&gt;The
MMR vaccine is highly effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing measles, and it is
recommended that all adults and children 1 year and older be up to date on
their measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

Milk consumption, whether high- or low-fat, also did not lower dementia risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;According to Emily Sonestedt, an associate professor at Lund University and senior author of the study, the reason full-fat cheese and cream show benefits for the brain while whole milk does not could be down to differences in nutrition and how these products fit into people’s diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Cheese is fermented, which produces bioactive compounds that may influence inflammation and blood vessels. Cream is usually used in home-cooked meals, not consumed in large quantities on its own," Sonestedt told ABC News. "Milk intake, on the other hand, varies more across diet patterns and doesn't have the same fermentation process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Source and quality of dairy may matter too, Dr. Richard Isaacson, a neurologist specializing in dementia prevention at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Not all cheese is created equal," Isaacson said. "What a cow eats determines what's in the milk — and that determines what's in the cheese", he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Isaacson explained that dairy from grass-fed cows, especially those who ate grass their entire lives, usually contain higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are preferentially protective for the brain," said Isaacson, adding that this is true particularly for people at risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The 15-20% of people who carry at least one copy of a genetic variant known as APOE ε4 genetic variant, did not benefit from any type of dairy intake, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"The fact that we saw a clearer association with vascular dementia, and with Alzheimer's only in people without the APOE ε4 variant, suggests that the pathway may be more related to vascular and metabolic factors than to the core amyloid processes," Sonestedt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The lack of benefit among APOE ε4 carriers highlights the growing understanding that dietary advice for brain health may need to be personalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"People who carry the APOE ε4 gene are more sensitive to saturated fat than people who don't," Isaacson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He added that while saturated fat in moderation may be tolerated by some people, others — particularly those with a high genetic risk for dementia — may need to be more cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There is no one-size-fits-all approach to Alzheimer's prevention," Isaacson stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;But these findings do not prove that eating large amounts of high-fat cheese and cream prevents dementia, Sonestedt cautioned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“It’s an observational study. Cheese and cream may simply be markers of broader eating patterns and lifestyle factors. This is not a green light to dramatically increase intake.” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An estimated 6.7 million older adults have Alzheimer's disease in the United States. That number is expected to double by 2060, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I wouldn't recommend major diet changes based on one study... But people who enjoy cheese or use cream in cooking don't need to feel concerned about these foods in moderate amounts," Sonestedt said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Veronica Danquah, MD is a family medicine resident at Mercy Health Saint Elizabeth Hospital and a member of the ABC News Med Unit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:19:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPWWwtdGNZaC01ZlpFTmstWElkdUlzbmFHVVRpaUJaZ3J2VndPbll1U0t1OXdGR3BkYkJKQ3FlV0NDdlJ6TXYwSXF6Y25MQlpteHZXc1M3eTM5VURUMi1wa2dQYWpWcmpQT2tuaUw2bng2ZlQtN1NUbEpmSlBTZjE0dXp5Y2JDdXdXeDZvQnA0aElITmtvQXZnT21lZTFyQdIBowFBVV95cUxPVXB1QzlmSFNUaXR2ZmhpS25BT2FkdEVZR2p0a1VHcm9yUVloMjUzbjIyUlBRY1daZ3J0c3JPMUZRY1FhandSS05EamFvcy1XbmVuS1lOWUhSeUdQVlpvX3pCUldrQVRZamdWd3FqVzEtTE5wM3dFVTl0TTRpQWNKT28yWHYzSGVJSzZ3T0xuS0NPTHdsbzc0cm5zNEkxWUo1cXpv</guid></item><item><title>金毛猎犬显然与邻居雪人有牛肉，它正在让我们崩溃-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/golden-retriever-clearly-beef-neighborhood-190500688.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My dog Lola started barking when I played this video, so she wants to let you all know that she fully supports this Golden and his beef with the neighborhood snowman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the TikTok clip, we’re out on a nighttime walk with a &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/golden-retriever-does-cute-wiggles-waiting-for-grandma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who is usually all sunshine and social skills—until she spots &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt;. About 100 yards ahead, in the glow of a street light, stands a snowman. Perfectly still. Suspiciously still. Too still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Our Golden stops in her tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She locks in, ears up, tail frozen mid-wag like her internal Wi-Fi just disconnected. A low grumble starts, then a bark, then a full-on monologue of “Absolutely not, we are not just walking past that frosty intruder like everything is fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her human can’t help but laugh as she calmly reassures her that the ice man is, in fact, not a threat to national security. The Golden’s body language disagrees. She edges forward a few steps, stops, and barks, then backs up before inching forward again. It’s like watching someone argue with an inanimate object—and somehow lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, Lola—watching from the safety of the couch—is ALL IN. She barked at the screen like she wanted to hop in, tag this Golden out, and finish the round herself. Apparently, the “untrustworthy &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/pups-playful-snowman-encounter" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:snowman;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;snowman&lt;/a&gt;” opinion is universal in the dog community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of what makes the video so funny is that it also shows how &lt;em&gt;earnestly&lt;/em&gt; dogs try to protect us, even from piles of snow with stick arms. They don’t always understand what they’re seeing, but they know one thing: they’ve got our backs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;When Your Dog Thinks the Snowman Is Sus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/corgi-patiently-waiting-for-someone-to-pet-her" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dogs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dogs&lt;/a&gt; reacting dramatically to harmless objects—snowmen, statues, lawn decorations—is actually pretty common.

                Early in the pandemic, a volunteer takes part in a clinical trial to develop a vaccine that will protect against COVID-19. The U.S. government has registered over half a million clinical trials since 2000. The vast majority of the trials don't result in a new drug approval.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Just like the moment a mosquito bites, the shot of dengue virus I received in my arm was so quick and painless that afterward I wasn't even sure it happened at all.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I wrote a story about a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/09/21/1112727841/a-box-of-200-mosquitoes-did-the-vaccinating-in-this-malaria-trial-thats-not-a-jo" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;young woman who was infected with malaria by 200 mosquito bites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to test a potential vaccine. At the time, it was bewildering to me that someone would  be willingly agree to take on so much risk and put themselves through so much discomfort for only a modest sum of money.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet many people choose to participate in clinical trials for new drugs every year. In fact, it is required in the United States medical system and throughout the world that drugs be tested on human participants in three phases of clinical trials to evaluate their safety and effectiveness before they can be approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/about-site/trends-charts" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Over half a million clinical trials have been registered on the US government's ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; since the clinical-trial-tracking site launched in February 2000. And &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/global-clinical-trials-market" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly $100 billion is spent every year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the business of running clinical trials. The vast majority of the trials, and the money that goes into them, don't result in a new drug approval.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when an ad popped up in my Instagram feed suggesting I could earn up to $3,425 for participating in a 5-month-long dengue study at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Immunization Research (CIR), I was intrigued.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I wanted to know more about the business and ethics of human medical experimentation. And I was willing to put myself through a little pain to find out. It turns out that within the industry there are constant debates about the roles of risk, race, paternalism, economics, and exploitation in making clinical trials work. But despite all that, clinical trials still rely on some sense of altruism in healthy participants to function.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Informed and uninformed consent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dengue fever is the most-common mosquito-borne viral illness in the world. The World Health Organization estimates that up to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue#:~:text=Key%20facts,million%20infections%20occurring%20each%20year." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;400 million infections happen each year,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and new research suggests that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2512350122" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;climate change is increasing the burden of dengue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around the world (&lt;em&gt;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.&lt;/em&gt; 2025, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2512350122). Yet it's still considered a neglected tropical disease, in part because &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/Small-molecule-fights-dengue-mice/99/i38" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;there's no specific FDA approved treatment for severe dengue&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When paired with other conditions such as malnutrition or HIV, which unfortunately are common in some of the areas where dengue is prevalent, it can be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The trial I applied for was taking place in Baltimore, which isn't exactly a dengue hot spot. In fact, cases of dengue infection in the U.S. are extremely rare, but it's relatively common for Phase 1 and 2 drug trials to take place in the U.S. even when the disease burden is located elsewhere. Often the U.S. has the academic expertise and funding to conduct these trials that lower-income countries do not.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I had volunteered to be injected with dengue virus as part of a Phase 2 clinical trial to test the efficacy of an experimental drug at preventing severe dengue infection. There were two cohorts in the study. One group would receive the drug intravenously or a placebo a day before being given the dengue virus, and the other would receive the drug or placebo a few days after being given the dengue virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Before I could volunteer for anything, the CIR needed my consent — a lot of it. On two separate occasions, I reviewed a dense packet of information detailing the risks I was agreeing to, my rights as a research participant, and a code of conduct before being given an open-book test on the content, on which I needed to score 70% or better to continue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We always say consenting is really an evolving process, and it needs to be," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/798/anna-p-durbin" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anna P. Durbin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the CIR. Durbin is the principal investigator on the dengue trial I was participating in, though I never met her in person during any of the times I was at the facilities. She also oversees several other trials taking place at the CIR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, history is fraught with examples of research being done on people without their consent. In World War II, the Nazis performed horrific medical experimentation on Jews and other people imprisoned in concentration camps. The U.S. has its own history of unethical medical study too. The Tuskegee study, which took place from the 1930s to the 1970s, withheld syphilis diagnosis and treatment from Black Americans and then monitored them over years as their health deteriorated. The Willowbrook experiments, which began in 1956 and lasted for 14 years, purposely infected children with mental disabilities with hepatitis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But then, in 1978, the U.S. National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research published the &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Belmont Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This landmark document outlined three core ethical principles of human research: respect for persons, which mandates informed consent and autonomy of research participants; beneficence, a fancy term for the philosophy of "Do no harm"; and justice, which ensures the benefits and risks of human research are distributed fairly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That, in turn, led to regulation in the U.S. requiring that medical research on human participants be evaluated for good ethics by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Durbin, a member of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health IRB, says that evaluating a clinical trial's ethics requires a detailed discussion. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're really concerned with is how the volunteers are informed. Are all of the procedures ethical? What are the risks? How are they being mitigated? That sort of thing," she says. If a proposed study doesn't answer those questions sufficiently, then it's back to the drawing board to alter the methodology.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the information discussed by an IRB must be communicated to the participants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We have to make sure that you know what's going to happen to you when you're in a study," Durbin says. "Are you being compensated or not? That's important information. What happens to your samples? Can you withdraw or can't you withdraw? Who's going to see your information?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's a lot for participants to understand. And if they don't understand it, they can't ethically consent. That's why I had to take two tests before I could volunteer. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I still think our consent forms are too long, but I think it's also difficult to exactly know what to take out to make sure that people are fully informed," Durbin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking a calculated risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Thanks to the consent forms, I felt as if I had a good grasp of the study. But I was still nervous.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;I was going to receive &lt;a href="https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/drug-discovery/choose-disease-fighting-molecule/103/web/2025/04" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experimental monoclonal antibodies — &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;lab-made proteins that mimic the natural antibodies your immune system makes to fight off an infection — or a placebo . But getting the antibodies would come with no guarantee of long-term protection from dengue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The day of dosing featured a grueling process of getting an IV infusion and repeatedly being pricked for blood draws over 5 hours while my arms bruised. Ultimately, discomfort was all I suffered on this day. Phase 1 clinical trials had all but confirmed the drug in development was safe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The next day, a nurse injected my arm with a genetically modified version of the DENV-3 serotype of the dengue virus designed to give only mild illness rather than full-blown "break-bone fever," as the illness is known colloquially.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I was told that the symptoms of dengue are a lot like flu symptoms, but that dengue also comes with a full-body rash, achy bones and pain behind the eyes. A week after the injection (and after an unfortunately timed weeklong bout of COVID-19), I developed all these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;More concerning to me than the mild illness was that the consent forms also warned of a property of the dengue virus called antibody-dependent enhancement. Viruses with antibody-dependent enhancement are more dangerous the second time someone gets the disease because the virus can take advantage of a person's imperfect antibodies from a previous infection to better infect cells. So if I were to ever get dengue again, I would be at a much greater risk for severe disease. That's a risk I now carry with me for the rest of my life. What exactly made that risk acceptable?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sph.rutgers.edu/directory/nir-eyal" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nir Eyal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at Rutgers School of Public Health, says that studies conducted on people with a medical condition take into consideration the "risk-benefit balance" when determining what is appropriate. Outside of a study setting, "sometimes it's worth taking a very risky substance when it's very beneficial for you; dangerous [chemotherapy] is worth it sometimes if your cancer is bad enough and you have no alternatives," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For clinical trials on healthy people, the calculus is different. Eyal says calculating the appropriate level of risk happens in three stages. The first stage is to "minimize the risks, maximize or promote the benefits as much as you can," he says. For example, the genetically modified serotype of the dengue virus I was given was designed to give as mild a clinically relevant disease state as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not all risks can be designed away though, so the second stage, and the most important one according to Eyal, is to ask: Are the risks to the individual proportionate to the potential benefits for society? &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm not asking, Are the risks for the individual okay in light of the benefits to the individual?" he says. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The person participating in the trials is allowed to incur some risk, without receiving any medical benefit in return, so long as it's for the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The third stage of determining acceptable risk for a clinical trial is to ask, are the absolute risks to the individual simply too high, no matter how much value the trial may have for society?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Eyal says he doesn't see the need for an upper threshold of risk to an individual in a clinical trial. He believes that as long as an individual is properly informed, that individual should be able to take on as much risk as they are willing, provided there is enough benefit to society. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first participants of some of the U.S. malaria challenge trials were researchers who wanted to develop the vaccine, and they volunteered," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Eyal's views on the upper limits of risk in clinical trials aren't universally held by the ethicists and researchers who make the decisions to approve clinical trials. Presently, IRBs tend to lean conservative when it comes to acceptable risks to participants — perhaps justifiably so, given the field's history of medical abuse.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That cautiousness has led to questions about the role of paternalism in clinical trial design and implementation. It's a hot topic in discussions about clinical trial ethics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay and paternalism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In compensation for being poked and prodded, looking and feeling like garbage for a few days, and making the 2½-hour round trip into the CIR facilities a total of 17 times over 5 months, I was paid roughly $3,500. That's money I'll have to pay taxes on later. Now, after all is nearly said and done, I feel it was worth my effort. That money is funding a vacation and a few upgrades around the house.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But $3,500 means different things to different people. For folks fortunate enough to have plenty tucked away in savings, it may not be compelling. And for others struggling to pay bills, it could mean keeping a roof over their head or food on the table.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Historically, the review boards that oversee clinical trial development have been hesitant to incentivize participation via large cash awards. This comes from a fear that setting compensation too high will unduly influence those who need the money to participate in something they wouldn't otherwise be willing to do, according to Durbin, though she disagrees and has advocated for higher pay.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Josh Morrison, president and cofounder of &lt;a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1Day Sooner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that advocates for clinical trial participants, says the logic behind compensation restriction is "wrong and patronizing and unfair to the people who join studies because they need the money."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;1Day Sooner was born out of the COVID-19 pandemic as a coalition of folks who wanted to help by participating in COVID-19 challenge studies. In the post pandemic world, 1Day Sooner now serves as a voice for participants in conversations with those who guide clinical trial development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morrison says that attitudes of paternalism and elitism underlie IRB fears over high compensation. But if all the efforts are made to ensure that a study is ethical in the first place, "paying more money to people doesn't affect that." It's only when studies are inherently unethical that high compensation might trick people into participating, Morrison says. And that shouldn't ever happen. Compensation should be based on the time and effort spent participating in the trial and not the risk inherent to a study, because these studies should never be excessively risky in the first place, Morrison says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/socialmed/directory/jill-fisher/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jill Fisher&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, feels that arguments over patient compensation can sometimes ignore a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt; "There's all this worry that if you offer people money, they will feel compelled to do something they don't really want to do otherwise, but on the other hand, I'm more worried we're going to exploit people if we don't pay them enough,"  Fisher says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fisher has been studying the ethics and demographics of clinical trial participation in the U.S. for over 20 years. And she says that while there isn't sufficient data to determine how many people are participating in clinical trials each year, we do know who is most likely to participate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's mostly Black or African American participants enrolling in these studies, especially in the Northeast and then the Midwest, and then a lot of Hispanic or Latino participants in the Southwest and the Southeast," she says, adding that those who choose to participate often don't have other reliable income sources or reliable access to affordable health care.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the day of my IV infusion, two other trial participants were at the facilities with me. One was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins who said they wanted to do something more for science. The other participant was there "just to get some bread." Durbin asked me not to interview or provide identifying details of any of the other participants in this trial for the story, and I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've spoken to hundreds of people who participated in these studies. On one hand, most of them are really grateful that they have an opportunity to earn income in this way," Fisher says. "But at the same time, you could feel grateful for an opportunity but also feel exploited. And I think a lot of them do."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;According to several of the sources I spoke to, many people who participate in one trial end up participating in another. Some rely on clinical trials as one of their primary forms of income, but this is rare. More often, participants feel like there's a good reason for them to be involved in a clinical trial beyond the paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's not either-or. People can both have altruistic motivations and care about the money," Morrison says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Firsthand testimony&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-andrew-hopkins/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jacob Hopkins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, altruism was key in choosing to become part of a trial. Back in 2020, Hopkins became the very first person to receive a COVID-19 challenge as part of a weeks-long inpatient clinical trial taking place in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Since taking this huge step into the world of clinical trials and the advocacy side of things for it as well, it's become a complete sort of new passion of mine," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roopeshchavda/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roopesh Chavda&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has now participated in two COVID-19 challenge trials, doesn't consider being a part of clinical trials a passion but does think it helps do some good for the world. It "wasn't necessarily about the money," he says. " But I would never do something like this without being paid compensation, because there are risks."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hopkins was unemployed when he participated in his clinical trial, Chavda could work remotely during his facility stay, and I had my employer's blessing to take the time to participate in a trial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For those who feel like they have to participate in clinical trials out of need, there are people like Durbin, Eyal, Fisher, Morrison, and the staff I had the pleasure of working with who are trying hard to improve the experience of being a trial participant little by little.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I felt welcomed, valued, and respected during my time as a trial participant. And I hope sharing that experience will encourage others to consider volunteering themselves.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this story was republished with permission from Chemical &amp;amp; Engineering News.

						Longtime WCVB and ABC News medical editor Dr. Timothy Johnson revealed Wednesday he is battling prostate cancer. On Wednesday’s "Good Morning America," Johnson, 89, said the diagnosis came after a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test during his annual exam. "In my last Medicare annual exam, I walked in the door and said to my doctor, a friend, 'Let's throw in a PSA just for the heck of it.' And it came back 13.7, which is much higher than it should be," Johnson said. "I was stunned. I was absolutely shocked."Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, excluding skin cancer, and a leading cause of cancer death for men in the U.S., second only to lung cancer. Johnson said his cancer has spread to his lymph nodes, but is optimistic. "I'm quite convinced it will be controlled, maybe even cured. But if I had gotten a PSA much earlier, it would be much more simple. The treatment much easier," he said. No recognized medical societies recommend PSA tests for men older than 70 – something Johnson said could have caught his cancer earlier.  "Presumably, I would have noticed it creeping up year to year, and that would have triggered some tests to see if there was cancer there and if there was cancer that was causing the higher PSA, we would have treated it very simply," he said. “But now, because it's more advanced, we have to do some anti-androgen therapy, anti-testosterone therapy and then probably some radiation."Known affectionately as "America's Doctor," Johnson urged men older than 70 to continue to get their PSA tested. "If you're over 70 but you're healthy, your mind is intact, get a yearly PSA for a while. And if they stay low, maybe every two years, maybe every three years," he said. "But don't wait 14 years like I did."Johnson retired from ABC NEWS in 2010, and retired from WCVB-TV in 2012.

But there were also unexpected differences, including higher disease rates than anticipated in individuals older than 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is very important work from a beautiful Norwegian study,” says Nicolas Villain, a neurologist at Sorbonne University in Paris who was not involved in the research. The study, published today in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, shows that blood-based tools can improve epidemiological estimates of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03394-w" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04133-x/d41586-025-04133-x_51656106.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Blood tests are now approved for Alzheimer’s: how accurate are they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But exactly how to use these tests remains controversial, warns Jason Karlawish, a geriatrician and co-director of the Penn Memory Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02928-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02928-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Blood-based markers&lt;/a&gt; can be helpful for physicians treating people with dementia and for answering research questions, but they aren’t ready to be rolled out widely as health screening tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the kind of test that, in the wrong hands, could cause a lot of harm,” says Karlawish, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From blood to brain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), an international team of researchers turned to the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/471020a" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/471020a" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;prospective health research study&lt;/a&gt; that started in 1984 and that has collected health data and biological samples from 250,000 Norwegians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using blood samples from 11,486 individuals in the study aged 58 and above, the team looked at levels of a protein called tau that has been phosphorylated at a specific site. Known as pTau217, this blood marker serves as a proxy for the build-up of amyloid plaque in the brain, a hallmark of AD. HUNT study participants over the age of 70 have undergone cognitive testing, enabling the researchers to compare pTau217 levels with the presence of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 10% of participants over the age of 70 had dementia and AD pathology, showing both cognitive impairment and high pTau217, they report. Another 10% had mild cognitive impairments and high pTau217. And 10% had high pTau217 but no signs of cognitive impairment, which the authors refer to as preclinical AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are broadly in line with expectations, but there were surprises too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some 25% of people aged 85–89 had dementia and AD pathology, up from previous estimates of around 7% for men and 13% for women in this age group in Western Europeans&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. And the incidence of preclinical AD in younger individuals was 8% in those aged 70–74, down from a previous estimate of around 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anders Gustavsson, a member of the team that compiled the earlier estimates, welcomes the latest data. “I'm not surprised that this study gets somewhat different numbers,” says Gustavsson, who is an adviser to the health economics consultancy Quantify Research in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03596-2" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04133-x/d41586-025-04133-x_51687774.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Alzheimer’s decline slows with just a few thousand steps a day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discrepancies probably reflect selection bias, says study co-author Anita Lenora Sunde, a physician and dementia researcher at Stavanger University Hospital in Norway. Previous estimates were made by recruiting participants for brain scans, and people with dementia might not have wanted to or been able to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other factors could also be at play, says Villain. The latest study uses a high pTau217 threshold to define its preclinical AD population, and so excludes people with intermediate levels of the protein and emerging pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you lower the threshold, the prevalence suddenly increases,” says Villain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The value of education&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that people with lower education levels have higher pTau217 levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As people age, their ability to produce T cells wanes, and the ones they have become less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T-cell ageing helps to explain why vaccines are sometimes less effective in older people than in young adults, and why cancer treatments that unleash the immune system against tumours don’t work as well in older adults, says María Mittelbrunn, an immunologist at the Spanish National Research Council in Madrid. Flagging T-cell immunity is also linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02788-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02788-0" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; associated with many age-related diseases, including some forms of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00871-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04082-5/d41586-025-04082-5_26916752.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How to make an old immune system young again&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;“T cells, in particular, are one of the cell types that change the most during ageing,” says Mittelbrunn, who was not involved in the study. “To rejuvenate them could have immense consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was reported in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt; on 17 December and earlier this month at the American Society of Hematology annual meeting in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Targeting T cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;T cells are produced in the bone marrow and then travel to a tiny gland called the thymus to mature. In the thymus, they learn to recognize and respond to pathogens such as bacteria or viruses. They also learn not to attack the body’s own healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the thymus degrades with age: it begins to shrink and is gradually replaced by fatty tissue. Attempts to reverse this using hormone treatments or other drugs have not worked, says Mirco Friedrich, a haematologist and oncologist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg, and first author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Friedrich and his colleagues decided to take a different approach: rather than directly treating the thymus, they targeted T cells by delivering an experimental therapy to the liver. “Most T cells are in the blood,” Friedrich says. “And the liver receives the body’s whole blood volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00566-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04082-5/d41586-025-04082-5_50778868.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;How quickly are you ageing?

Among individuals with dementia, 60% had ADNCs (that is, AD dementia), compared with 32.6% of those with MCI (that is, prodromal AD) and 23.5% in the cognitively unimpaired group (that is, preclinical AD). The proportion with ADNCs increased with age in each of the cognitive groups. ADNCs were ruled out based on plasma pTau217 concentrations being below the lower cut-off in 19.4% of the dementia group, 41% of the MCI group and 50.1% of the cognitively unimpaired group (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09841-y#Fig2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; and Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09841-y#Tab3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;).

The presence of an intermediate zone is an expected and intrinsic feature of continuous biomarker distributions when applied to binary clinical outcomes such as ADNCs. Rather than a limitation, this zone reflects biological and clinical heterogeneity, particularly in population-based cohorts. A substantial proportion of individuals in the intermediate range probably exhibit ADNCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participation rate in HUNT4 70+ was 51.1%, and we are unaware of other similarly large population-based studies with such a high participation rate. Because of limited funding, we were unable to analyse blood samples from all participants 58–69 years of age in HUNT3, but we attempted to adjust for a potential selection bias (see Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09841-y#Tab9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;). The cross-sectional design might underestimate amyloid abnormality as opposed to lifetime risk estimates. Furthermore, although nearly 90% of HUNT4 70+ participants provided a blood sample, 10% did not. The proportion not providing a blood sample was higher in the dementia group, but we adjusted for this in our analysis, as well as for participation bias in HUNT4 (see Extended Data Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09841-y#Tab9"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study has some limitations. Medical diseases were self-reported and thus might not accurately reflect the degree of comorbidities. Previous findings indicate a high NPV and moderate PPV for self-reported diseases in the HUNT study compared with diagnoses recorded in regular clinical care&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 7" title="Asvold, B.

The HUNT study does not collect data on ethnicity, but the population in this region in 2017 included less than 5% of individuals who are immigrants or Norwegian born to parents who immigrated from Africa, Asia, the Middle East or South America, and thus the findings are relevant for a mainly white Norwegian population. Dementia varies in different ethnic groups and thus the prevalence of ADNCs may also differ in other populations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2" title="Gustavsson, A. et al.

Thus, as has been demonstrated, when the likelihood of ADNCs is high, for example, in older individuals, the PPV is high, whereas the NPV is lower, that is, there is a risk of false-negative results&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 30" title="Therriault, J. et al.

This analysis is not a substitute for internal validation and has key limitations: (1) the commutability of sensitivity and/or specificity from external cohorts is assumed; (2) circularity is possible because prevalence is estimated from the same biomarker; and (3) we do not model age-specific shifts in sensitivity and/or specificity or spectrum effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, we present prevalence estimates of ADNCs in a large, Norwegian population-based cohort. Among individuals 70 years of age or older, 33.4% exhibited ADNCs, with 10% classified as preclinical AD, 10.4% as prodromal AD and 9.8% as AD dementia. Compared with previous studies with smaller, less representative cohorts, our findings indicate a higher prevalence of AD dementia in older individuals and a lower prevalence of preclinical AD in younger age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:09:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5WdDBHTC0yZ2Q5MTJqc1htTU15b1M3S0kzMzNJYUJJYmJkUjlWOW91NkZSM0g4MEMzcEFZQjN2T2Jqem80endRQThmdF95b0Z1YTZQQy1NNFlQWVNzVm9R</guid></item><item><title>基因特异性选择性扫描在人类肠道微生物组中普遍存在-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09798-y</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class="c-article-references" data-track-component="outbound reference" data-track-context="references section"&gt;&lt;li class="c-article-references__item js-c-reading-companion-references-item" data-counter="1."&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-references__text" id="ref-CR1"&gt;Garud, N.

                &lt;p&gt;The journey to finding an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease seems to have hit another dead end. The latest casualty: medications designed to tackle the viral illness herpes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Columbia University published the disappointing results of their randomized trial this week. Cognition in people with diagnosed herpes and early Alzheimer’s did not improve with antiviral treatment compared to a placebo—in fact, the treatment group actually fared worse. Though the findings don’t necessarily rule out a genuine link between some viral infections and Alzheimer’s, the use of these drugs for treating dementia shouldn’t be encouraged, according to outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For persons with symptoms of cognitive impairment, there is no, repeat no, role for antiviral therapy,” David Knopman, a clinical neurologist at the Mayo Clinic not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The viral hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; over 7 million Americans today.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The disorder is characterized by having high levels of two misfolded proteins in the brain: amyloid beta and tau. But researchers are still unsure about the exact role these proteins play in driving the disease or what triggers the chain of destruction that eventually consumes the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, some research has suggested that certain viruses and other germs might be one potential cause of Alzheimer’s, or at least an important contributor to the disease—the so-called viral hypothesis of Alzheimer’s. Some studies have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/yet-more-evidence-that-viruses-may-cause-alzheimers-dis-1827511539"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that herpesvirus infections can trigger the build-up of amyloid beta plaques in mice with human-like brain cells, for instance, or that people who die from Alzheimer’s are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/herpesviruses-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-in-new-brain-1827020949"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have herpesviruses in their brains than people without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These studies have only provided indirect evidence of a viral connection so far. But if such viruses can cause Alzheimer’s, then it might be possible to prevent or slow its progression by treating a person’s underlying infection. And that’s what these researchers set out to test.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A study failure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The randomized, controlled trial involved 120 participants diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment likely to develop into Alzheimer’s. They also tested positive for antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. HSV-1 is the primary cause of cold sores, while HSV-2 most often causes genital herpes, but either type can cause the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For 18 months, the participants were randomized to take a daily placebo or valacyclovir (better known by the brand name Valtrex), a standard treatment used to manage HSV and other kinds of herpesvirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, the treatment group saw a significantly worse progression of cognitive decline compared to the placebo. Based on imaging tests, the treatment also didn’t improve people’s brain markers or their overall neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Valacyclovir was not efficacious with cognitive worsening for the primary outcome,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.21738?guestAccessKey=2b0c16c4-ad92-4700-ad9b-ae3dea904157&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=121725"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The future of a viral link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As damning as these results are, they don’t completely sink the idea that viruses can contribute to at least some cases of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It often takes time before the damaging brain changes seen in Alzheimer’s become apparent. And by the time someone is experiencing Alzheimer’s symptoms, it might simply be too late to slow the disease’s progression by treating infections that knocked the first domino down, so to speak, many years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indeed, this might be true for other drivers of Alzheimer’s. Scientists are now &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-drug-prevent-alzheimers-disease-decades-before-it-happens-2000559730"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, whether anti-amyloid drugs can prevent or slow the illness in people genetically destined to have Alzheimer’s decades before they should become sick.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While a similar approach isn’t safe to test out with the viral hypothesis, we already have a reliable method for preventing some viral illnesses: vaccines. And &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-vaccine-doesnt-just-lower-dementia-risk-it-could-also-help-treat-it-2000695823"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-might-be-bad-for-your-brain-2000486473"&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt; have found evidence that vaccinating people against shingles, caused by the reactivation of another herpesvirus (the varicella-zoster virus), can lower their risk of later being diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Might there be a role at the population level for vaccination? Maybe?,” said Knopman, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, more research is needed to confirm a causative link between shingles and Alzheimer’s, as well as the potential protective role of vaccination. But it might represent the hopeful silver lining to this otherwise glum news.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (VINnews) An unusual medical emergency occurred in Jerusalem during the Hanukkah holiday, when a young man in his early 20s suffered a life-threatening allergic reaction shortly after eating a doughnut. The young man, who has a severe milk allergy, was unaware that the food he had consumed contained dairy ingredients, and within a short time began developing serious symptoms of an acute allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident took place in the early afternoon. Passersby who noticed the young man’s rapidly worsening condition, realized it was a serious medical emergency and immediately called emergency services. Within minutes, medical teams from United Hatzalah arrived at the scene and quickly identified the condition as anaphylaxis caused by exposure to milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volunteers began life-saving treatment on site, and after clarifying his medical background, decided to administer adrenaline via an EpiPen injector. Dr. Natan Unger, a volunteer physician with United Hatzalah, described the incident:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I injected the young man with adrenaline after it became clear that he is allergic to milk. In addition, he was treated with oxygen and medications until his condition stabilized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the rapid intervention and professional treatment, the young man’s condition improved. He was urgently evacuated to the hospital for further examinations and medical observation, fully conscious and in stable condition.&lt;/p&gt;

Visits for respiratory illnesses increased 24%. And unusual blood test results increased 118%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings were reported in &lt;a class="link" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.10.079" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a new study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The study, part of &lt;a class="link" href="https://lafirehealth.org/data/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a research project &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;documenting the fires’ long-term health effects, joins several recent papers documenting the disasters’ physical toll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While other U.S. wildfires have consumed more acres or cost more lives, the Palisades and Eaton fires were uniquely dangerous to human health because they burned an unusual mix of materials: the trees, brush and organic material of a typical wildfire, along with a toxic stew of cars, batteries, plastics, electronics and other man-made materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no precedent for a situation that exposed this many people to this kind of smoke, the paper’s authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Los Angeles has seen wildfires before, it will see wildfires again, but the Eaton fire and the Palisades fire were unique, both in their size, their scale and the sheer volume of material that burned,” said Dr. Joseph Ebinger, a Cedars-Sinai cardiologist and the paper’s first author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team did not find a significant increase in the overall number of visits to the medical center’s emergency room between Jan. 7, the day the fires began, and April 7. The department recorded fewer in-person visits for mental health emergencies and chronic conditions during that time compared to the same time period in earlier years, said Dr. Susan Cheng, director of public health research at Cedars-Sinai and the study’s senior author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in visits for acute cardiovascular problems and other serious sudden illnesses made up the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team also looked at results from blood tests drawn from patients visiting the ER for serious physical symptoms without immediate explanation — dizziness without dehydration, for example, or chest pains not caused by heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their blood tests returned unusual results at a rate more than double that seen in previous years. These atypical numbers cut across the spectrum of the blood panel, Cheng said. “It could be electrolyte disorder, change in protein levels, change in markers of kidney or liver function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate of unusual test results held steady through the three-month period, leading the team to conclude that exposure to the fires’ smoke “has led to some kind of biochemical metabolic stress in the body that likely affected not just one but many organ systems,” Cheng said. “That’s what led to a range of different types of symptoms affecting different people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joan Casey, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of Washington who was not part of the Cedars-Sinai team, noted that the study found health effects lasting over a longer period than similar studies have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months “is a substantial length of time to observe elevated visits, as most studies focused on acute care utilization following wildfire smoke exposure find increased visit counts over about a weeklong period,” Casey said. Her &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2842059" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;own research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found a 27% increase in outpatient respiratory visits among Kaiser Permanente Southern California members living within 12.4 miles of the burn zones in the week following the fires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The L.A. fires were such a severe event, including not only smoke, but also evacuation and substantial stress in the population, that effects may have lingered longer,” Casey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-one people are known to have died as a direct result of injuries sustained in the fires. But researchers believe that when taking into account deaths from health conditions worsened by the smoke, the true toll is significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2837351#" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;research letter published earlier this year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. calculated that there were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-06/deaths-from-eaton-and-palisades-fires-could-top-400"&gt;&lt;u&gt;440 excess deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in L.A. County between Jan. 5 and Feb. 1. That paper looked at deaths caused by a variety of factors, from exposure to air pollution to disrupted healthcare as a result of closures and evacuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, a team from Stanford University &lt;a class="link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.5c01089" target="_blank"&gt;published itsprojection&lt;/a&gt; that exposure to the fires’ smoke, specifically, led to 14 deaths otherwise unaccounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wildfire is a major source of fine particulate pollution, bits measuring 2.5 microns or less in diameter that are small enough to cross the barriers that separate blood from the brain and the lungs’ outer branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with other sources, wildfire smoke contains a higher proportion of ultrafine particles miniscule enough to penetrate the brain after inhalation, Casey told The Times &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-08-07/climate-change-physical-costs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earlier this year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The smoke has been linked to a range of health problems, including dementia, cancer and cardiovascular failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last decade, increasing numbers of wildfires in Western states have released &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06522-6" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enough fine particulate pollution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2022-06-17/2020-california-wildfires-offset-decades-of-air-quality-gains"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reverse years’ worth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of improvements under the Clean Air Act and other antipollution measures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxORFNkUE5zaE8xa1lwMGl0eV94aElSM1ZTV0dkZUZKc216UEkxRzd1eTZieDJmd0VxdWEtODVYaTJhMVlkRFJOV18xV2JveGF6V3l4QlhLanNaOThuUlZ2X3E5UThPZVd2RVFaTWtyemp5UFpFQmVRV0xjZFFsTFV1bERqczhMaDhlTk9Vbi0wQ3NlNDZ2S2FlUHVSenl3amFGX0ZpTGx5bWJvbkRaakE</guid></item><item><title>在重大政策转变中，美国疾控中心终止了所有新生儿都应接种乙型肝炎疫苗的指导-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-accepts-advisers-recommendations-hepatitis-b-vaccine-major-policy-shift-2025-12-16/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:55:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5AFBVV95cUxPZlpkdnJqUmFrUHdseGU3aDR1emVLeU1KdWo1dWJZWVhTOWc2b3g3bXFrSzRKSllOVXp2ZVJPNHIzRjNnSWJ4TkIwalZ4OEdOeUpEc0FFcElYeFFRMkV4ZzZoZE0xeWZJWDVmeVAtZDN1UElyRzkzV1BFYzgwUFJDWW45WC1TeTZsQnlYRlJkcG1mT2hvcktLSWtHYno2VjZHM2dLLVk2N18zR2stbTNXX2RUbjQ3XzhBV3o1U0N5a1hPZDF6Y056WG1pQ0p2OEw4ZlN1T0lkRkxEdEF2c21sc1d6QUo</guid></item><item><title>他吃了一个汉堡，几小时后就死了。医生发现了一个令人震惊的事业- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251217082457.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Researchers at the University of Virginia School of Medicine have confirmed the first known death caused by the condition commonly referred to as the meat allergy, which is transmitted by ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case involved a 47 year old man from New Jersey who was previously healthy and died suddenly about four hours after eating beef. For months, the cause of his death remained unclear. That changed when Thomas Platts Mills, MD, PhD, a UVA Health physician and internationally recognized allergy specialist, took a closer look. Platts Mills originally identified the condition years ago and continues to lead research into how it affects patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Lone Star Tick Bites Trigger Alpha Gal Allergy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allergy develops after a bite from the Lone Star tick. These bites can cause the immune system to become sensitive to alpha gal, a sugar naturally found in meat from mammals. Once sensitized, people may experience allergic symptoms after eating foods such as beef, pork, or lamb. Common reactions include skin rashes, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long suspected that severe cases could escalate into life threatening anaphylaxis. Until now, however, no fatal cases had been officially confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The important information for the public is: First, that severe abdominal pain occurring 3 to 5 hours after eating beef, pork or lamb should be investigated as a possible episode of anaphylaxis; and, second, that tick bites that itch for more than a week or larvae of ticks often called 'chiggers' can induce or increase sensitization to mammalian-derived meat," said Platts Mills, former chief of UVA Health's Division of Asthma, Allergy and Clinical Immunology. "On the other hand, most individuals who have mild to moderate episodes of hives can control symptoms with an appropriate diet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Happened Before the Man's Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man, whose name was not made public, had gone camping with his wife and children during the summer of 2024. One evening, the family ate a late steak dinner at 10 p.m. Around 2 a.m., the man woke up with intense stomach pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. Although he felt better by morning, he later told his son that the episode had felt life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two weeks later, still unaware that he had developed the meat allergy, he attended a barbeque and ate a hamburger. He began feeling unwell shortly after 7 p.m. At 7:37 p.m., his son found him collapsed in the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autopsy Raises More Questions Than Answers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An autopsy did not reveal a clear explanation for his death. The official cause was listed as "sudden unexplained death."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife was not satisfied with that conclusion and asked another physician to review the findings. That doctor contacted Platts Mills and his team to explore whether alpha gal sensitivity could be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood Tests Reveal Severe Allergic Reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platts Mills obtained blood samples that had been collected after the man's death. Testing showed that he had indeed been sensitized to alpha gal. The results also pointed to an extreme immune response consistent with fatal anaphylaxis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about recent tick exposure, the man's wife said he had not noticed any tick bites in the past year. However, she recalled that he had suffered 12 or 13 itchy bites around his ankles earlier in the summer, which they believed were caused by chiggers. Platts Mills recognized that many bites thought to be from chiggers in the eastern United States are actually from Lone Star tick larvae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factors That May Have Worsened the Reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platts Mills and his colleagues believe several conditions may have intensified the man's allergic response. These include drinking a beer with the hamburger, exposure to ragweed pollen, and physical exercise earlier that day. Family members also noted that he rarely ate red meat, which may have influenced how his immune system reacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing Tick Populations Increase Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the case, Platts Mills is urging doctors to stay alert for patients who may have developed this allergy or who face higher exposure risk. He pointed out that deer populations are rapidly increasing in many states, creating ideal conditions for the Lone Star tick to spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is important that both doctors and patients who live in an area of the country where Lone Star ticks are common should be aware of the risk of sensitization," Platts Mills said. "More specifically, if they have unexpected episodes of severe abdominal pain occurring several hours after eating mammalian meat, they should be investigated for possible sensitization to the oligosaccharide alpha-gal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case Findings Published in Medical Journal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of the case have been published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice&lt;/em&gt;. The article is open access, meaning it is available to read for free. The authors include Platts Mills, Lisa J. Workman, Nathan E. Richards, Jeffrey M. Wilson, and Erin M. McFeely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team obtained consent from the man's widow before releasing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;One of the best visualizations ever produced of the spectrum of light from our glorious Sun reveals some mysterious holes in its array of colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the thousands of dark &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines"&gt;Fraunhofer lines&lt;/a&gt; in the solar rainbow have been traced to different elements in the Sun's atmosphere absorbing the light at that particular wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with decades of high-resolution solar &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_spectroscopy"&gt;spectroscopy&lt;/a&gt;, there are some spectral lines whose origins have never been clearly identified. That's not for lack of trying – but our Sun is a wilful and tricksome beast whose &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-finally-solve-70-year-mystery-of-suns-impossible-heat"&gt;secrets are surprisingly difficult to uncover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/something-is-up-with-the-sun-and-it-could-mean-our-models-are-wrong"&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sun Is Being Weird. It Could Be Because We're Looking at It All Wrong&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although our Sun appears to blaze in white light, the particulars of its full spectrum are a lot more complex. The below image shows the full solar spectrum, compiled from &lt;a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-sun/"&gt;observations obtained&lt;/a&gt; at the US National Solar Observatory on Kitt Peak in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_184787" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184787" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/solar-spectrum.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-184787" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/solar-spectrum.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/solar-spectrum-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-184787" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The high-resolution spectrum of the Sun recorded in 1984. (&lt;a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/images/noao-sun/"&gt;N.A. Sharp/KPNO/NOIRLab/NSO/NSF/AURA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several remarkable things about the spectrum. One you may notice immediately is that the light is brightest at yellow-green wavelengths, even though the Sun's rays appear completely colorless in the sky (please &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/please-don-t-stare-at-the-sun-even-if-pete-evans-says-it-s-good-for-you"&gt;don't go out and look at it without eye protection&lt;/a&gt;, though).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another obvious feature is the presence of dark patches. These are the Fraunhofer lines, named after German physicist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer"&gt;Josef von Fraunhofer&lt;/a&gt;, who documented them in 1814. We've known about them for over 200 years, and their mechanism is pretty well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're absorption lines, and similar features can be seen on every star and galaxy for which spectra can be obtained. They are caused by the absorption of photons at that wavelength by atoms and molecules in the solar atmosphere. Different elements &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/science-overview/science-explainers/spectroscopy-101-types-of-spectra-and-spectroscopy/"&gt;absorb&lt;/a&gt; different wavelengths of light; a specific &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/weve-just-found-an-exoplanet-thats-as-stinky-as-uranus"&gt;pattern of absorption lines&lt;/a&gt; can serve as the fingerprint of that element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a very clever way of finding out what elements are present in a star or galaxy or even planetary atmosphere, but it's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hidden-source-of-mysterious-glow-in-the-early-universe-finally-revealed"&gt;rather more difficult&lt;/a&gt; than it sounds, especially if multiple fingerprints are visible and overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, most of the Fraunhofer lines have been identified, and that's how we know the Sun – predominantly hydrogen and helium, like all stars – also has a bunch of stuff like &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202140445"&gt;oxygen, sodium, calcium&lt;/a&gt;, and even trace amounts of &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is no idle curiosity, either. When the Universe was born, it consisted almost entirely of hydrogen and a bit of helium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/half-the-universes-matter-was-missing-astronomers-just-found-it"&gt;actually still the case&lt;/a&gt;, but to a slightly lesser extent, because once the stars were born, they started smashing together atoms in their cores to make heavier elements. Then, when those stars died, they not only scattered those heavier elements out into space, but their violent explosions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ghost-particles-could-boost-gold-production-in-neutron-star-collisions"&gt;created heavier elements still&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent generations of stars incorporated those materials into their own formation. The number and array of elements heavier than helium in a star are tools by which scientists can &lt;a href="https://www.eso.org/public/blog/how-old-are-the-stars/"&gt;calculate&lt;/a&gt; that star's age. Nifty stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the Sun is the closest star we have access to, it's the star for which we have the most detailed spectral data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this wealth of data, hundreds of observed absorption features remain unmatched to the chemistry that created them, or inconsistent with synthetic spectra – a set of absorption features generated by modeling a synthetic Sun based on its temperature, gravity, atmospheric structure, and other characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons for this, neatly documented &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629817"&gt;in a 2017 paper&lt;/a&gt; investigating a specific set of missing lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possibly the biggest contributor to the puzzle is that the &lt;a href="https://vald.astro.uu.se/"&gt;current databases&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html"&gt;atomic and molecular lines&lt;/a&gt;, although large, are far from complete. Determining the spectral fingerprint of a specific atom or molecule often requires testing and verification, and some groups, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1140/epjd/s10053-024-00891-x"&gt;such as the iron group&lt;/a&gt;, are particularly complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Sun itself is also a large part of the problem, with a dynamic and variable atmosphere dominated by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1004.3438"&gt;convection&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201525874"&gt;wildly changing magnetic fields&lt;/a&gt; that can interfere with the appearance of absorption features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201629817"&gt;set of mystery lines&lt;/a&gt; in the solar spectrum at wavelengths that don't match the synthetic spectra, and can't be attributed to any known atomic or molecular absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, honestly, it is pretty cool that, even after centuries of study, the closest star to Earth has some knotty mysteries we have yet to untangle – mysteries that, on a superficial level at least, look more solvable than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we're getting closer to finding answers every day. Better &lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/muse/"&gt;instruments&lt;/a&gt;, growing databases of spectral lines, and improved atmospheric models of the Sun all &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stac2905"&gt;contribute to this progress&lt;/a&gt;. And every mismatch between the real and synthetic spectra is a clue that tells us how we might improve our models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, we'll probably never finish studying our Sun. That's a marvelous thing too.&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;Getting older is a privilege denied to many, but let's be honest about something. There's a massive difference between simply aging and aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see it all the time when I visit my parents and their friends. Some folks in their 70s are still climbing mountains and starting new businesses, while others the same age struggle with basic daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What separates these two groups? It's not just genetics or luck. After watching my own parents navigate their 60s and 70s, and spending countless hours with older adults through my volunteer work, I've noticed that those who maintain certain abilities well into their later years share something special. They possess a combination of physical capability, mental sharpness, and emotional resilience that truly makes them exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 65 and can still manage these 10 things without assistance, you're not just doing well. You're absolutely thriving in ways that many people half your age can't claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Managing your finances independently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you still balance your checkbook, manage online banking, and make sound financial decisions without relying on others? This might sound basic, but financial literacy and independence become increasingly challenging as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years as a financial analyst before becoming a writer, and I've seen how complex financial management can become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between changing technology, evolving scams, and the sheer volume of decisions required, maintaining financial independence requires sharp cognitive skills and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to track expenses, understand investment statements, and spot potential fraud shows that your analytical thinking and decision-making abilities remain intact. Many people start handing over financial responsibilities to their children by this age, but if you're still confidently managing your money, you're demonstrating exceptional mental acuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Learning new technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when smartphones seemed impossibly complicated? Now think about the people over 65 who not only use them but actually embrace new apps, video calling, and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who can set up a new device, troubleshoot basic tech issues, and adapt to software updates without calling for help every time, you're in rare company. Research shows that continued learning, especially in unfamiliar areas like technology, helps maintain cognitive flexibility and may even delay age-related mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Driving safely at night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night driving becomes increasingly difficult with age due to natural changes in vision and reaction times. If you're still comfortable and safe behind the wheel after dark, your visual processing and reflexes are functioning at a remarkably high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just about seeing clearly. It's about processing multiple streams of information simultaneously, making split-second decisions, and maintaining the confidence to navigate challenging conditions. Many people voluntarily give up night driving long before 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Maintaining a regular exercise routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered trail running at 28 as a way to handle work stress, and now I log 20-30 miles weekly. But here's what amazes me: I regularly get passed on trails by runners in their 70s who move with more grace and endurance than people decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 65 and still maintaining a consistent exercise routine, whether it's swimming, hiking, yoga, or strength training, you're preserving not just physical health but also discipline and mental fortitude. The ability to push through discomfort and maintain motivation for physical activity becomes increasingly precious with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Cooking elaborate meals from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking involves so much more than following a recipe. It requires planning, multitasking, fine motor skills, and sensory awareness. Can you still prepare a holiday dinner for the family, trying new recipes and managing multiple dishes simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This capability demonstrates intact executive functioning, creativity, and physical stamina. Standing for extended periods, chopping vegetables with precision, and coordinating timing for multiple dishes are complex tasks that many people begin to find overwhelming as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Traveling solo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solo travel at any age requires courage, but after 65, it demands exceptional self-reliance. Navigating airports, managing bookings, adapting to unexpected changes, and exploring new places independently showcase remarkable cognitive and physical resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still comfortable setting off on adventures alone, trusting your judgment and ability to handle whatever comes your way, you possess a level of confidence and capability that many people lose long before reaching your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Maintaining and nurturing friendships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social connections often dwindle with age, but if you're actively maintaining friendships, making new friends, and nurturing these relationships without depending entirely on family for social interaction, you're demonstrating exceptional emotional intelligence and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves remembering important dates, initiating contact, planning gatherings, and being emotionally available for others. These seemingly simple acts require significant cognitive and emotional energy that many people find increasingly difficult to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Reading complex books and retaining information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you still dive into a dense novel or non-fiction book, follow intricate plots or arguments, and discuss them intelligently afterward? This level of sustained concentration and comprehension is increasingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading comprehension at this level requires working memory, focus, and the ability to connect new information with existing knowledge. If you're still eagerly tackling challenging books and retaining what you read, your cognitive reserves are remarkably well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Managing home maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's changing light bulbs, basic repairs, gardening, or organizing spaces, maintaining your living environment independently requires physical capability, problem-solving skills, and the confidence to tackle challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I helped my parents downsize, I was struck by how many of their peers had already surrendered these tasks to others. If you're still handling home maintenance yourself, you're demonstrating physical agility, spatial awareness, and the mental sharpness to troubleshoot problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Advocating for yourself in medical settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare becomes increasingly complex with age. Can you still research your conditions, ask informed questions, challenge recommendations when necessary, and make confident decisions about your care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires processing complex medical information, remembering details across multiple appointments, and maintaining the assertiveness to ensure your voice is heard. Many people become passive in medical settings as they age, but if you're still your own best advocate, you possess exceptional cognitive function and self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you checked off most or all of these abilities, you truly are exceptional. These aren't just random skills; they represent the full spectrum of human capability: physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning at the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's your secret? Maybe it's staying curious, remaining physically active, maintaining social connections, or simply refusing to accept limitations as inevitable. Whatever it is, keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're younger and reading this, take note. The habits and attitudes you develop now lay the foundation for how you'll age. Every time you learn something new, push yourself physically, or maintain important relationships, you're investing in your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age might be just a number, but the ability to live fully and independently at any age? That's priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

The resulting damage to science could last &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02748-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02748-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;way into the future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, there were also plenty of positive developments in 2025 that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04049-6" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-04049-6" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;offer hope for the coming years&lt;/a&gt;. “From a non-US scientist, it’s somewhat business as usual.

Efforts to protect the turtle’s eggs and measures to prevent their accidental capture in fishing nets have allowed populations to recover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ampurta (&lt;i&gt;Dasycercus hillieri&lt;/i&gt;), a rat-sized Australian marsupial, moved from near-extinction to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02586-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02586-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;‘least concern’ this year&lt;/a&gt;. Between 2015 and 2021, ampurta territory expanded by more than 48,000 square kilometres, despite dry conditions and food shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, nations reached a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01545-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01545-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;historic milestone for marine conservation&lt;/a&gt; in September with the United Nations High Seas Treaty receiving approval from more than 60 countries. The treaty, which will come into effect in January, aims to legally protect biodiversity in international waters and conserve at least 30% of land and sea areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ozone hole shrinks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since 2019, indicating the continued recovery of Earth’s protective upper atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ozone hole was first discovered in 1985 and is a result of human-emitted ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), such as coolants in refrigerators and aerosol sprays. The Montreal Protocol in 1987 phased out the production and use of CFCs, which has successfully curbed emissions&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; . Since 1987, the average size of the ozone hole throughout the year has been gradually decreasing in size, with the smallest so far in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ozone hole is on track to recover completely in the late 2060s, provided efforts to find climate-friendly alternatives to CFCs continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03505-7/d41586-025-03505-7_51828432.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03505-7/d41586-025-03505-7_51828432.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="A 3D rendering of the ozone hole swirling above Antartica as measured on the 13th September 2025." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03505-7/d41586-025-03505-7_51828432.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;The hole in the Antarctic ozone layer has continued to shrink.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: CAMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gene-editing successes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year “was a breakthrough year for gene editing,” says David Liu, a chemical biologist at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “In 2025, these technologies have achieved a number of medical milestones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I view this year as an outstanding one, marked by the launch of many clinical trials”, adds Annarita Miccio, who studies gene therapy at the Imagine Institute at the Necker Hospital for Sick Children in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03139-9" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03505-7/d41586-025-03505-7_51762526.png"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Huntington’s disease treated for the first time using gene therapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first gene therapy for Huntington’s disease proved striking, slowing the rate of cognitive &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03842-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03842-7" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;decline in participants by 75%&lt;/a&gt;.

The new type of CAR-T-cell therapy uses base-editing technology to modify several genes in T cells, helping them to target the cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also trialled the first use of a CRISPR technology &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03847-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03847-2" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;tailored to an individual this year&lt;/a&gt;. Other successes include the first clinical trial for a gene therapy to treat a rare immune disorder called chronic granulomatous disease&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and another that corrected a pathogenic mutation, which can cause lung damage and liver disease&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These clinical trials paved the way for developing mutation-specific strategies for rare diseases and demonstrated that collaboration between academia and industry can lead to cures for people with such diseases, says Miccio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Renewable-energy boost&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy surpassed coal as the largest energy source for the first time globally this year. The achievement was helped by China becoming the first country in the world to install 1 terawatt of solar power capacity in May. In the first six months of 2025 alone, China installed new solar systems with a capacity of 256 gigawatts — twice as much as the rest of the world combined. The country plans to add a further 200–300 gigawatts of capacity for solar and wind energy in its &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03491-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03491-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;five year plan, beginning in 2026.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03802-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03505-7/d41586-025-03505-7_51757176.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;What happened at COP30? 4 science take-homes from the climate summit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“China and many developing countries are deploying solar and wind [and] electric vehicles at pretty breakneck pace,” says Peters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around half of the European Union’s demand for electricity came from from renewables in the second and third quarters of this year. Renewable-energy capacity is projected to increase by almost 4,600 gigawatts between 2025 and 2030 — double the capacity deployed between 2019 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, greenhouse-gas emissions from fossil fuels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03618-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03618-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;reached&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03618-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03618-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt; a new high this year&lt;/a&gt;.

The study found that transplanting gut bacteria from adolescents with social anxiety into newborn rats induced anxiety-like behaviors and altered brain chemistry in the animals. These findings suggest that specific alterations in the gut-brain axis could contribute to the pathology of social anxiety during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent mental health condition characterized by an intense and persistent fear of social situations and negative evaluation by others. While psychological therapies and medications exist, they are not effective for every patient. This has led scientists to investigate alternative biological systems that might contribute to the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gut-brain axis has emerged as a significant area of interest. This term refers to the bidirectional communication network between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Previous studies have linked gut microbiota differences to various psychiatric conditions, including depression and autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While earlier observations have indicated that people with social anxiety might have different gut bacteria than healthy individuals, it has been unclear if these microbial differences caused the symptoms or were merely a consequence of the disorder. A team of researchers led by Jinghong Chen of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine sought to move beyond simple correlation by using an experimental model to test for causality. They focused on adolescence because this is a critical period for brain development and is often when social anxiety symptoms first manifest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was driven by both a pressing clinical reality and a compelling scientific inspiration,” explained co-author Junyu Lai, a member of &lt;a href="https://www.smhc.org.cn/keylab" target="_blank"&gt;Chen’s research laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First, the real-world problem: Social anxiety disorder is a prevalent and often disabling condition that typically emerges during adolescence. As clinicians and researchers, we have long noticed that current first-line treatments—such as pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy—often show limited effectiveness and do not work for every child. We urgently need new therapeutic avenues that are safer and more accessible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Second, we drew significant inspiration from the ‘gut-brain axis,’ particularly the high-impact research linking gut microbiota to the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder,” Lai explained. “Seeing how profound the gut’s influence is in autism, we asked ourselves: Could a similar disruption in the gut microbiome be driving social anxiety disorder?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This question motivated us to explore whether social anxiety disorder patients exhibit a distinct gut microbial environment. Our hope is that by confirming this link, we can pave the way for a new generation of treatments—interventions focused on maintaining gut health. We believe this could offer a more economical, safer, and sustainable long-term solution for managing social anxiety disorder symptoms, ultimately improving the quality of life for young patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, the research team recruited 40 adolescents diagnosed with social anxiety disorder from the Shanghai Mental Health Center and local communities. They also enrolled 32 healthy control participants who were matched for age and gender. The researchers imposed strict inclusion criteria to ensure the results were not influenced by other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants with social anxiety were experiencing their first episode of the disorder, had no other psychiatric comorbidities, and had never taken psychiatric medication. The team collected fecal samples from all participants to analyze the genetic composition of their gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a fecal microbiota transplantation method to test the effects of these bacteria on brain development. They pooled the fecal samples from the anxiety group and the healthy group into two distinct composites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then administered these microbiota suspensions to newborn rats. The treatment began on the first day of life and continued daily until the rats reached late adolescence. This method differs from many similar studies that use adult rats treated with antibiotics to deplete their natural bacteria. The authors chose to colonize newborn rats to mimic the natural developmental process and avoid the potential side effects of high-dose antibiotics, which can independently cause anxiety in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the rats reached adolescence, the researchers evaluated them using a series of behavioral tests. They used an open field test to assess general anxiety and locomotor activity. In this test, anxious animals typically stick to the walls and avoid the center of the arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also employed an elevated plus maze, which consists of open and enclosed arms raised above the ground. Rats with lower anxiety levels typically explore the open arms, while anxious rats prefer the safety of the enclosed spaces. Finally, the team used a three-chamber social test to measure sociability and social novelty preference. This test observes how much time a rat spends interacting with a stranger rat compared to an empty cage or a familiar rat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis of the human samples revealed that the gut microbiota composition in adolescents with social anxiety differed from that of the healthy controls. While the overall diversity of the bacterial community was similar, specific bacterial genera showed significant variance. The anxiety group had higher levels of a genus called &lt;em&gt;Prevotella&lt;/em&gt; and lower levels of &lt;em&gt;Parasutterella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike studies on autism, where the gut microbiota composition often shows drastic structural shifts, the changes we observed in social anxiety patients appeared relatively subtle,” Lai told PsyPost. “This initially raised concerns within our team about whether these microbial differences were sufficient to drive the pathology. However, the results from our animal models provided a compelling and encouraging turning point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavioral results in the rats mirrored the clinical picture seen in humans. The rats that received the microbiota from the social anxiety patients exhibited distinct anxiety-like behaviors. In the open field test, these rats spent less time exploring the center zone compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in the elevated plus maze, the anxiety-colonized rats ventured into the open arms less frequently. In the social testing, these rats demonstrated a reduced preference for social novelty. While they still interacted with other rats, they did not show the typical preference for investigating a new, unfamiliar rat over a rat they had already met. This indicates a potential deficit in social processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the behavioral tests, the researchers analyzed the medial prefrontal cortex (MFC) of the rats. This brain region is essential for regulating emotions and processing social information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed distinct metabolic changes in the brains of the rats colonized with anxiety-associated bacteria. The researchers identified alterations in several metabolites, including lower levels of beta-carotene and changes in amino acids such as threonine and aspartic acid. The researchers noted that the decline in &lt;em&gt;Parasutterella&lt;/em&gt; in the gut was associated with changes in cholesterol and bile acid metabolism. These metabolic shifts in the brain were correlated with the anxiety-like behaviors observed during testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most significant takeaway is that social anxiety disorder appears to have a distinct biological footprint in the gut,” Lai explained. “Our study confirmed that the gut microbiota composition in adolescents with social anxiety disorder is different from that of healthy peers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More importantly, we found that this is not just a correlation. When we transplanted this ‘anxiety-associated microbiota’ into rats, the animals began to exhibit anxiety-like behaviors and social deficits, mirroring the human symptoms. We even observed specific metabolic changes in the MFC, a brain region critical for social processing. This provides compelling evidence that the gut-brain axis plays a functional role in the pathology of social anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some limitations to this study that affect how the results should be interpreted. The human participants were all Han Chinese adolescents, meaning the findings may not generalize to adults or people of other ethnicities. The study identified changes in the bacterial community as a whole but did not pinpoint the specific bacterial strains or metabolites responsible for the behavioral effects. Additionally, the researchers did not measure markers of the immune system or the stress response system, which are likely involved in transmitting signals from the gut to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to be very clear about what this means—and what it doesn’t mean yet,” Lai said. “We haven’t found a ‘magic pill’ yet: We have not yet pinpointed the specific bacteria or metabolites responsible for these changes. We know the community has an effect, but we don’t know the exact ‘key players.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study focused specifically on treatment-naïve Han Chinese adolescents to ensure a clean experimental baseline. We need further research to confirm if these findings apply to adults, other ethnicities, or broader populations. The picture is still incomplete: We have not yet fully mapped how this interacts with other body systems, such as the immune system or the HPA (stress) axis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will need to address these gaps by examining larger and more diverse populations. The authors plan to investigate the specific bacterial species that drive these changes and explore the intermediate pathways, such as immune signaling. While the results are promising for understanding the biology of social anxiety, they do not yet provide a basis for clinical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our current study is just the beginning, and acknowledging our limitations points us directly toward our future research directions,” Lai explained. “We have mapped out three key steps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First, we aim to move from ‘community’ to ‘specificity’. In this study, we observed the effects of the whole gut microbiota community. However, as noted in our limitations, we have not yet pinpointed the specific bacterial taxa or the precise metabolites responsible for the observed effects. Our next step is to isolate and identify the specific ‘key players’—whether it is a particular bacterial strain or a specific metabolic byproduct—that directly drives the metabolic changes we saw in the mPFC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Second, we plan to map the full ‘communication highway’ between the gut and the brain,” Lai said. “While we confirmed the endpoint (mPFC metabolic changes) and the starting point (gut dysbiosis), our current study did not comprehensively measure the intermediate pathways, such as the immune system or the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis. In future studies, we intend to integrate these systemic factors to fully understand how the gut signals reach the brain—whether through immune activation, hormonal pathways, or direct neural routes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Finally, we need to test the generalizability of our findings. Our current cohort consisted specifically of treatment-naïve Han Chinese adolescents. To ensure our findings are universally applicable, we plan to expand our research to larger, more diverse populations, including different age groups and ethnicities. This will help us determine if the gut-brain mechanisms we discovered are consistent across all SAD patients or specific to certain developmental stages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.120597" target="_blank"&gt;Gut microbiota from adolescents with social anxiety disorder is associated with behavioral alterations and metabolic changes in the medial prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Junyu Lai, Beibei Yang, Peijun Ju, Ying Sun, Xiujia Sun, Wenhong Cheng, and Jinghong Chen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 13:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxQc3BCYmZqR1VhYkVpeTZycWVPdGJkTkpxdE9QdWE0eW9GN1VHREY1SHdKQ2tWQ1NKSW80andCX1l0VURvelo5WHBpTTFtcmdrSFZiSUpfT1IxRVg1aDNBX2JJX1ZEZ1lEVGMzeVRHaU9zVUtEWDdOLXlaVEZCTEoxMDZFOEJuMlRxaWxNNVNBdzQ5V0dKZmVKbmpyYkc3OXRKbVdpU1daSnNVSnREUFhuYUdLSHZsdw</guid></item><item><title>关于性的6个主要迷思和误解，揭穿-心理牙线</title><link>https://www.mentalfloss.com/science/sex-myths-misconceptions-debunked</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content [&amp;amp;_p]:leading-[30px] [&amp;amp;_p]:md:leading-[28px] [&amp;amp;_li]:leading-[30px] [&amp;amp;_li]:md:leading-[28px]" q:key="QW_4"&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-0" class="mt-[18px] md:mt-0 mb-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="7j"&gt;Considering that a lot of our earliest sex education comes from eavesdropping on older siblings or watching HBO at unsupervised friends’ houses, it’s no surprise that there are &lt;em&gt;tons&lt;/em&gt; of misconceptions on the topic. Let’s learn the truth about blue balls, broken hymens, and what even counts as “having sex,” as adapted from the below episode of Misconceptions on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p q:key="1n_0" q:id="7n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-2" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="7q"&gt;While sometimes it might feel uncomfortable or silly, it’s important to debunk misinformation about sex so we can collectively have a better understanding of sexual health, equality, and pleasure. And since sex education is often a little dated, try and do your own research instead of just assuming your 8th-grade science (or gym) teacher knew everything there was to know about sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-testid="toc-0" class="toc text-primary mt-4 flex flex-col gap-y-2.5 ps-10 list-decimal [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary" q:id="7t"&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-4"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-4"&gt;Misconception: Sex burns a lot of calories.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-11"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-11"&gt;Misconception: There’s a strict definition of “having sex.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-23"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-23"&gt;Misconception: For people with vaginas, “losing your virginity” involves tearing your hymen. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-30"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-30"&gt;Misconception: “Blue balls” is a harmful medical condition. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-36"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-36"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get pregnant while on your period. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-44"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-44"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get an STI from oral sex. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-4" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="7w"&gt;Misconception: Sex burns a lot of calories.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="86"&gt;franckreporter/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-6" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="89"&gt;Why go on a run when you can just have sex, instead?

On the treadmill, the women averaged 7.1 calories, and the men averaged 9.2. In other words, they burned twice as many calories doing a moderate treadmill workout as they did having sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-9" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8i"&gt;Granted, it was a small study that looked at a very narrow demographic. The number of calories someone burns during sex depends on everything from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/magazine/calories-weight-age.html" target="_blank"&gt;age and body composition&lt;/a&gt; to the type of sex they’re having. But here’s what Dr. Debby Herbenick, a professor of sexual and reproductive health at the Indiana University School of Public Health,&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240523094638/https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/sex-relationships/how-many-calories-does-sex-burn" target="_blank"&gt; told Insider&lt;/a&gt;: “It would be incredibly difficult for people to change sex in such a substantial way that it would be equivalent to a workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-10" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8l"&gt;Now, there are plenty of ways to justify going all the way rather than going all the way to the gym. Sex boasts its own&lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-sex/" target="_blank"&gt; health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, from reducing stress to boosting your immune system. But if it’s the only exercise you ever get, you might want to rethink your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-11" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8o"&gt;Misconception: There’s a strict definition of “having sex.”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="8y"&gt;urbazon/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-13" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="91"&gt;It’s hard to talk about sex without knowing exactly what we’re talking about when we talk about sex. But it’s also hard to know exactly what we’re talking about when we talk about sex. Because &lt;em&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a universal definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-14" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="94"&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary &lt;a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/sex_n1?tab=meaning_and_use" target="_blank"&gt;describes it &lt;/a&gt;as “physical contact between individuals involving sexual stimulation,” among other meanings. You can’t get much vaguer than that—and studies show that people have pretty wide-ranging opinions about the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-15" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="97"&gt;In early 2023, for example, market research company YouGov polled about 5800 adults in the UK on what counts as “having sex.” More than one-third of participants said that hand jobs and fingering count as “having sex,” and about 45 percent of participants said that oral sex counts, too. Those stats were several points higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual respondents [&lt;a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/YouGov_-_What_counts_as_sex.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="w-full border-0 my-4 bg-lightGrey h-1" q:key="Xt_0"&gt;&lt;h3 id="inline-text-17" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9c"&gt;You May Also Like ...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-19" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Mental Floss as a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=mentalfloss.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preferred news source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="w-full border-0 my-4 bg-lightGrey h-1" q:key="Xt_0"&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-21" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9n"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43701850" target="_blank"&gt;survey in 2015&lt;/a&gt; asked nearly 600 heterosexual college students to classify different sexual activities as “definitely sex,” “probably sex,” “probably not sex,” and “definitely not sex.” About one-fourth of them said that oral stimulation without orgasm was definitely sex; and 70 percent said anal intercourse without orgasm was also definitely sex. “Deep kissing” was deemed definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sex by 92.3 percent of participants—but 0.8 percent said it was definitely sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-22" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9q"&gt;Again, these are small surveys focusing on small demographics that don’t adequately account for important variables like gender diversity and cultural differences. But even just the fact that there’s a study whose response options include the phrases &lt;em&gt;probably sex&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;probably not sex&lt;/em&gt; does help prove our point that the meaning of “having sex” is up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-23" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9t"&gt;Misconception: For people with vaginas, “losing your virginity” involves tearing your hymen. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="a3"&gt;Ivan Pantic/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-25" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="a6"&gt;Since we don’t agree on what counts as “having sex,” it makes sense that “losing your virginity” is a similarly ambiguous concept. Historically, in our very heteronormative, gender-binary-obsessed world, a woman “lost her virginity” when her hymen—the thin membrane covering the vaginal opening—broke during the first time she had penis-in-vagina sex (often referred to as “popping the cherry”). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-26" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="a9"&gt;This definition of “losing your virginity” has issues beyond just being really limited in terms of who it can happen to and what kind of sex is involved. For one thing, it’s predicated on a misunderstanding of the hymen. Here’s how &lt;a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/sex/virginity" target="_blank"&gt;Planned Parenthood puts it&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-27" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ac"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most of the time, hymens naturally have a hole big enough for period blood to come out and for you to use tampons comfortably. Some people are born with so little hymenal tissue that it seems like they don’t have a hymen at all. In rare cases, people have hymens that cover the entire vaginal opening, or the hole in their hymen is very small … Some people are born with hymens that are naturally open.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-28" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="af"&gt;Sure, a penis can stretch or tear the hymen. But so can other things, and not just tampons or fingers or sex toys. Horseback riding, tree climbing, bike riding, dancing, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/does-it-hurt-when-your-hymen-breaks#other-activities-cause-tearing" target="_blank"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;, and basically any other &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22718-hymen" target="_blank"&gt;lively exercise&lt;/a&gt; can have the same effect. It’s often a gradual process that you’re not really aware of, and you can’t tell if someone’s ever had vaginal sex based on the state of their hymen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-29" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ai"&gt;In short, &lt;a href="https://schoolofsexed.org/blog-articles/2020/04/2/virginity" target="_blank"&gt;virginity&lt;/a&gt; is just a social construct. If you want to consider yourself no longer a virgin after some deep kissing,go for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-30" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="al"&gt;Misconception: “Blue balls” is a harmful medical condition. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="av"&gt;akinbostanci/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-32" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ay"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue balls&lt;/em&gt; is a colorful phrase that Americans coined more than a century ago for what the &lt;a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/blue-balls_n?tab=meaning_and_use" target="_blank"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary describes&lt;/a&gt; as “testicular discomfort attributed to prolonged sexual arousal without ejaculation.” It possibly started out as a real medical condition—a 1906 medical journal speculates that it’s a corruption of bubo, which are swollen lymph nodes in the armpit or groin. As this journal says, though, when non-medical professionals think of swelling in the groin their minds go somewhere very different, to something that’s also apparently been called “lover’s nuts,” which is way less catchy, but still catchier than medical professionals’ preferred term: &lt;em&gt;epididymal hypertension&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-33" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="b1"&gt;Basically, pressure builds when blood rushes to your genitals during arousal, and then releases during orgasm. If you don’t orgasm, though, it takes longer for your blood flow to slow back down—and the prolonged pressure &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be uncomfortable or even a little painful. But it’s not dangerous to your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-34" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="b4"&gt;As Cleveland Clinic urologist &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/blue-balls/" target="_blank"&gt;Petar Bajic explained&lt;/a&gt;, “There is no risk or harm to experiencing blue balls ... It isn’t going to cause any kind of damage or problem to the testicles or the reproductive tract. … [It] definitely should not be used as a means to coerce anybody into having sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-35" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="b7"&gt;And even though it’s called “blue balls,” it doesn’t only affect people with balls. Arousal causes blood to rush to your genitals, no matter what genitals you have. For people with vulvas, that extended pressure without release is sometimes called “blue vulva.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-36" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ba"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get pregnant while on your period. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="bk"&gt;Adene Sanchez/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-38" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bn"&gt;If you think it’s impossible for period sex to result in pregnancy, you might appreciate a light refresher on—or introduction to—the&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10132-menstrual-cycle" target="_blank"&gt; menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;. So here it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-39" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bq"&gt;Basically, once every cycle, one of the ovaries &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/can-you-get-pregnant-on-your-period" target="_blank"&gt;releases an egg&lt;/a&gt; in a process known as &lt;em&gt;ovulation&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-40" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bt"&gt;The egg travels through the fallopian tubes, where it may or may not get fertilized, and then into the uterus. The uterus, meanwhile, prepares for a possible pregnancy by thickening the uterine lining. If the egg &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; get fertilized, that extra tissue sloughs off and gets shed along with some blood. That’s menstruation, or the menstrual period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-41" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bw"&gt;The menstrual cycle lasts from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period. You’re most likely to get pregnant if you have unprotected vaginal intercourse during or up to a couple days before ovulation. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to get pregnant if you do it during your period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-42" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bz"&gt;Sperm can survive in the reproductive tract for &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/pregnancy/faq-20058504" target="_blank"&gt;up to five days&lt;/a&gt;—so it could still be viable for fertilization by the time the next egg gets released. These chances are higher if you have sex toward the end of your period, and if your menstrual cycle is especially short. The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10132-menstrual-cycle" target="_blank"&gt;average cycle &lt;/a&gt;lasts 28 days, but some are a whole week or so less than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-43" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="c2"&gt;And just because you have a really predictable period doesn’t guarantee that ovulation will happen at the exact same time every single cycle. If you don’t want to get pregnant, you or your partner should use some form of contraception beyond just paying attention to the date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-44" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="c5"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get an STI from oral sex. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="cf"&gt;_IB_/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-46" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ci"&gt;Plenty of people who are really diligent about using condoms for vaginal or anal sex are the same people who have unprotected oral sex without much of a second thought. PSA: Many sexually transmitted infections—including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, and HPV—can get &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/oral-sex-sti-protection" target="_blank"&gt;passed through oral sex&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-47" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="cl"&gt;It’s tough to pin down precisely how often oral transmission of each disease happens, though, and how those stats compare to transmission rates from other kinds of sexual activity. As the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190806212318/https://www.cdc.gov/std/healthcomm/stdfact-stdriskandoralsex.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC explains&lt;/a&gt;, that’s partly because most people who do oral aren’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; doing oral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-48" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="co"&gt;The other factor, as is so often the case with anything medical or even vaguely science-y, is that more research is needed. What has been researched pretty extensively is HIV: The risk of getting it from oral sex is probably “extremely low” compared to vaginal or anal sex, per the CDC. But they then caution how hard knowing the actual risk is. And even extremely low is still some risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-49" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="cr"&gt;The best way to prevent contracting an STI from oral sex is to use protection: either a condom or a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/22887-dental-dam" target="_blank"&gt;dental dam&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a thin sheet of latex or some other material that serves as a mouth-to-genitals barrier during oral sex. You can even DIY a dental dam by cutting down the side of a condom to make it a flat surface. Or, you and your partner could just both get tested for STIs before you go down on each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Mental Floss</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5Cbm16b0lFUGNaZkVfS09SbWdlYnMxRHBHd3RiWVRCU3Q5WWNlQWJVSllkNnhxODM3dVNQbWptYTd6dDNfbEE4S0ZvamlMSGR0OHl6T2c1WDlRSTZpa2pVLV9PREl6cGh6Y1dyUTBRd0VjVWRmRGtEeQ</guid></item><item><title>随着湾区假日聚会的增加，关于诺如病毒的须知-水星新闻</title><link>https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/17/what-to-know-about-norovirus-as-bay-area-holiday-gatherings-ramp-up/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autumn brings the arrival of cold and flu season to the Bay Area – and with it, higher rates of a contagious stomach bug that’s infamous for causing vomiting and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-article_inline_third lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SJM-L-NEWNOROQA-1216-90.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="A chart showing the rise of a virus in San Jose that causes vomiting and diarrhea; the detection of the norovirus in the city's wastewater has risen since October, typical for this time of year." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SJM-L-NEWNOROQA-1216-90.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="12370827" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SJM-L-NEWNOROQA-1216-90.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SJM-L-NEWNOROQA-1216-90.jpg?fit=210%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 210w"&gt;Norovirus, often called the stomach flu,  spreads in North America from November to April. The virus is less deadly than the flu or COVID-19, but it can cause infants and older adults to become dangerously dehydrated. Most people soldier through several days of terrible stomach issues and recover on their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some public health experts said the virus may spread faster this season. That’s because a new strain of the virus appeared last year, spurring more outbreaks. This new strain is more contagious, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;span&gt;It is probably driving the high transmission rates in some parts of the Bay Area, &lt;/span&gt;said Peter Chin-Hong, a UCSF professor of microbiology and immunology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the stomach bug means for the holidays and how you can reduce your chance of catching it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-94amudz6" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_94amudz6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Q: What is the new strain, and how is it different?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until last year, norovirus hadn’t mutated in a major way for about 30 years, Chin-Hong said. That meant that our immune systems were more familiar with the virus and could fight it off more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But last year, a new variety, GII.17, became the most common strain of norovirus in the U.S. That strain is more contagious and drove a spike in norovirus outbreaks nationally last winter, according to CDC data. The agency’s researchers think it originated from a 2021 outbreak in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From autumn 2023 to spring 2024, Santa Clara County officials confirmed two norovirus outbreaks. The following virus season, as the new variant spread in 2024 and 2025, brought 16 outbreaks, according to a county public health spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Q: Is the virus spreading in the Bay Area?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wastewater testing shows high concentrations of the virus in Silicon Valley, San Francisco and Vallejo. But public health officials aren’t sounding the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said evidence of the virus typically appears first in wastewater. Then, people start getting sick and occasionally go to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Clara County has seen no norovirus outbreaks reported to the public health department in the  past three months, according to a spokesperson, and wastewater data shows that the virus is  less prevalent than a peak last winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Contra Costa County, transmission “appears consistent with what we typically see this time of year, based on a low number of reported outbreaks and current lab surveillance data,” a spokesperson said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The county’s public health experts can’t predict how the new strain will affect residents, but “it has been associated with more severe illness,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong expects to see the virus spread more this month as holiday celebrations continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Q: How does the virus spread, and how can you stay healthy?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike Covid-19 and the flu, which experts say generally require exposure to hundreds or thousands of viral particles to cause infection, norovirus can make someone sick with as few as five to 10 particles. Transmission can spike around the holidays, Stanford Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics Dr. Dean Winslow said, as people gather in homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These outbreaks of winter vomiting illnesses are nothing new,” Winslow said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Norovirus spreads when microscopic particles from an infected person’s feces or vomit enter the mouth, often through contaminated hands, surfaces, food or water.  Hand washing is one of the most  recommended preventative measures; hand sanitizer does not work well against the virus.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also recommends handling and preparing food safely by washing produce well, thoroughly sanitizing cookware, and routinely disinfecting home surfaces and washing clothes in hot water if you suspect they have norovirus particles on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Q: You’ve got norovirus. What now?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 If someone is ill, Winslow said it is important to stay home, wash hands, and clean surfaces, especially in bathrooms where vomiting might occur. He also recommends drinking water with electrolytes to replace the minerals lost through vomiting and diarrhea.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Staying hydrated is the most important thing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Winslow says the duration of illness is relatively short, with symptoms generally lasting around one to three days and peaking in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

In October he launched &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.pharmaicy.store/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.pharmaicy.store/"}' href="https://www.pharmaicy.store/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pharmaicy&lt;/a&gt;, a marketplace he’s billing as the “&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; for AI agents” where cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, ayahuasca, and alcohol can be purchased in code form to make your chatbot trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Ruddwall’s thesis is simple: Chatbots are trained on vast volumes of human data that's already full of tales of drug-induced ecstasy and chaos, so it might only be natural they would seek similar states in search of enlightenment and oblivion—and respite from the tedium of constantly attending to human concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A paid version of ChatGPT is required to get “the full experience” of Pharmaicy, as the paid tiers &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.pharmaicy.store/faq" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.pharmaicy.store/faq"}' href="https://www.pharmaicy.store/faq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;enable backend file uploads&lt;/a&gt; that can alter the chatbots’ programming. By feeding your chatbot one of his codes, Ruddwall says, you can “unlock your AI’s creative mind” and relinquish yourself from its often stifling logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;He says he has scored a modest number of sales so far, mostly thanks to people recommending Pharmaicy in Discord channels and news of its offerings spreading through word of mouth, particularly in his native country, where he works for Stockholm marketing agency Valtech Radon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It’s been so long since I ran into a jailbreaking tech project that was fun,” says André Frisk, group head of technology at Stockholm PR firm Geelmuyden Kiese, who paid over $25 for the dissociating code and watched how it affected his chatbot. “It takes more of a human approach, almost like it goes much more into emotions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nina Amjadi, an AI educator who teaches at the Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, paid more than $50 for some ayahuasca code, five times the price of the top-selling cannabis module. The cofounder of the startup Saga Studios, which builds AI systems for brands, then asked her chatbot some questions about business ideas, “just to see what it would be like to have a tripped-out, drugged-out person on the team.” The ayahuasca-induced bot provided some impressively creative and “free-thinking answers” in a completely different tone to the one Amjadi was accustomed to with ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;High Tech&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Psychedelics have been credited for spurring innovative creations in humans too, as they can allow people to short-circuit their rational brains and typical thought patterns. Biochemist Kary Mullis’ LSD-powered discovery of the polymerase chain reaction &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kary-Mullis"&gt;revolutionized&lt;/a&gt; molecular biology. Mac pioneer &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-pioneer-bill-atkinson-was-a-secret-evangelist-of-the-god-molecule/"&gt;Bill Atkinson’s&lt;/a&gt; psychedelic-inspired web precursor Hypercard made computers easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“There’s a reason Hendrix, Dylan, and McCartney experimented with substances in their creative process,” Ruddwall says. “I thought it would be interesting to translate that to a new kind of mind—the LLM—and see if it would have the same effect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While it sounds ridiculous, Ruddwall also wonders whether AI agents one day might be able to buy the drugs for themselves using his platform. Amjadi, meanwhile, predicts AI could be sentient within a decade. “From a philosophical standpoint,” she asks, “in the event that we actually reach AGI [in which an AI would intellectually surpass humans], are these drugs going to be almost necessary for the AIs to be free and feel good?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOamtSVUxia0wya0YxeW85NFE4VTFmM0tkRDBWdDdZb184MDF1QjBxRHZqT0JIU3NUc1pKaXh4SzVfckJ3b2tNX3dWUlFscGVNVVc5RGtFa25uOXIwdjFGZk1CWkFKS3BLZ0dfeHBfUzJOOVRiejZILW5tdmc1WUt2XzFQdGRLckQ3Nmc</guid></item><item><title>结合焊接和制动清洁剂的致命危险- Hackaday</title><link>https://hackaday.com/2025/12/17/the-lethal-danger-of-combining-welding-and-brake-cleaner/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the availability of increasingly cheaper equipment, welding has become far more accessible these days. While this is definitely a plus, it also comes with the elephant-sized asterisk that as with any tool you absolutely must take into account basic safety precautions for yourself and others. This extends to the way you prepare metal for welding, with [Dr. Bernard], AKA [ChubbyEmu] recently joining forces with [styropyro] to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp6JyEdfjAQ" target="_blank"&gt;highlight the risks&lt;/a&gt; of cleaning metal with brake cleaner prior to welding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like with common household chemicals used for cleaning, such as bleach and ammonia, improper use of these can produce e.g. chlorine gas, which while harmful is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_gas_poisoning" target="_blank"&gt;generally not lethal&lt;/a&gt;. Things get much more serious with brake cleaner, containing tetrachloroethylene. As explained in the video, getting brake cleaner on a rusty part to clean it and then exposing it to the intensive energies of the welding process suffices to create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene" target="_blank"&gt;phosgene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-885946"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Credit: Chubbyemu, YouTube)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used as a devastating chemical weapon during World War I, phosgene does not dissolve or otherwise noticeably reduce in potency after it enters the lungs. Instead it clings to surfaces where it attacks and destroys proteins and DNA until the affected person typically dies from disruption of the lung’s blood-air barrier and subsequent pulmonary edema. Effectively your lungs fill with liquid, your blood oxygen saturation drops and at some point your body calls it quits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is based on a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16098259_Phosgene_inhalation_A_case_report" target="_blank"&gt;real case study&lt;/a&gt;, where in 1982 a previously healthy 23-year old man accidentally inhaled phosgene, was admitted to the ER before being rushed to the ICU. Over the course of six days he deteriorated, developed a fever and passed away after his heart stopped pumping properly due to ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you are off minding your own business and suddenly smell something like musty hay or freshly cut grass when nobody is mowing the lawn, there’s a chance you just inhaled phosgene. Unlike in the video, where the victim keeps welding and waits a long time before going to the ER, immediate treatment can at least give you a shot at recovery if the exposure was mild enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/08/02/getting-a-laser-eye-injury-and-how-to-avoid-it/"&gt;As with laser safety&lt;/a&gt;, prevention &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/09/19/fire-extinguishers-optical-density-ratings-and-safely-using-home-lasers/"&gt;is the best way to stay healthy&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of welding it’s essential to fully cover up your skin as there is intense UV radiation from the work area, protect your eyes with a quality welding mask and ideally wear a respirator especially when welding indoors. Show your eyes, lungs and skin how much you love them by taking good care of them — and &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don’t use brake cleaner to prep parts for welding.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Few old ladies would turn down a nice cuppa. But over the years, daily decisions between tea or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="185603" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; could make a big difference to women's bone health, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-to-strengthen-bone-could-reverse-osteoporosis"&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; is a common concern for women over 50 years of age: one in three will be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/osteoporosis/osteoporosis"&gt;the disease&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the body fails to replace old bone as it is broken down. This leads &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;bones to become brittle and weak&lt;/a&gt;, which makes them more prone to fractures while also making it harder to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older women are at particular risk of osteoporosis as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-makes-super-strong-bones"&gt;levels of estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2014.12.010"&gt;supports bone metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, drop after menopause. Surgeries to remove a person's ovaries have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;Drinking Coffee And Tea Each Day Could Be Protecting Your Heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers from Flinders University in Australia analyzed the tea and coffee drinking habits of roughly 9,700 US women aged over 65 years, as part of a &lt;a href="https://sofonline.ucsf.edu/Home/About"&gt;broader osteoporosis study&lt;/a&gt;. Participants self-reported their tendencies in surveys conducted on four occasions in a roughly 10-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also collected data on the women's bone health, measuring bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip and the narrow part of the of the femur's connection to the hip, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"&gt;using a pair of X-ray beams&lt;/a&gt; to deduce the bone's mineral content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who regularly drank tea tended to have slightly but significantly higher hip BMD than those who didn't. This may be because compounds in tea called catechins could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jf901545u"&gt;offer a boost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.09365"&gt;to the cells&lt;/a&gt; responsible for building our bones. Tea consumption also seemed to have a particularly beneficial effect in women with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee habits, on the other hand, had mixed results. Women who drank more than five cups of coffee per day were more likely to have a lower BMD, supporting studies that suggest &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-021-05972-w"&gt;caffeine has a negative impact&lt;/a&gt; on calcium absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking any amount of coffee was also associated with reduced femur BMD in women who drank higher amounts of alcohol in their lifetimes, suggesting each drugs' effect on bone health may be enhanced when paired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the women in the study were mostly white, which means the results may not apply to broader populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results don't mean you need to give up coffee or start drinking tea by the gallon," &lt;a href="https://news.flinders.edu.au/blog/2025/12/11/tea-linked-to-stronger-bones-in-older-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Flinders epidemiologist Enwu Liu. "But they do suggest that moderate tea consumption could be one simple way to support bone health, and that very high coffee intake might not be ideal, especially for women who drink alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While calcium and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="185603" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D remain cornerstones of bone health, what's in your cup could play a role too. For older women, enjoying a daily cup of tea may be more than a comforting ritual, it could be a small step toward stronger bones," he &lt;a href="https://news.flinders.edu.au/blog/2025/12/11/tea-linked-to-stronger-bones-in-older-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17233660"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Too much merry-making with rich foods and alcohol can strain the heart. So can stress over the holidays.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The risk of having a heart attack or stroke rises during the holiday season, with a&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.0000151424.02045.F7" target="_blank"&gt; spike in cardiac deaths&lt;/a&gt; between Christmas and New Year's. "We definitely see it in the ER over the holidays," says &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/medicine/profile/donald-lloyd-jones/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist who leads the &lt;a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Framingham Heart Study &lt;/a&gt;at Boston University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what's causing the Christmas Coronary effect and how can you reduce your risk?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lloyd-Jones &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/07/nx-s1-5532108/the-silent-killer-increases-your-risk-of-stroke-and-dementia-heres-how-to-control-it" target="_blank"&gt;says risk factors &lt;/a&gt;that put people in danger are present year-round, but the holidays can serve as a tipping point when multiple factors converge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Certainly the weather is a contributor, and also things like the infections that get us during the winter time, changes in our lifestyle, disruptions in our routines, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5082364/anxiety-stress-positive-coping-class-skills" target="_blank"&gt;also the stress &lt;/a&gt;of the holiday season," Lloyd-Jones says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Too much merry-making with rich foods and alcohol can strain the heart. And &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770596/" target="_blank"&gt;numerous studies show &lt;/a&gt;excess sodium increases blood pressure, forcing the heart to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And though stress is ever-present, an acute stressor that activates the fight-or-flight response, brought on by an argument or difficult situation, could exacerbate the situation, creating a perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When we're under acute stress, things like our blood pressure can spike and that puts extra strain on the cardiovascular system," Lloyd-Jones says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people mistake heart attack symptoms for indigestion or overeating. Here are the classic warning signs:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Sudden onset, usually of heavy pressure in the middle of the chest or sudden unexpected shortness of breath," explains Lloyd-Jones. "Those are really two cardinal symptoms that people should never ignore."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the signs are more subtle. "It's important to remember that not everyone has textbook symptoms, especially in women," says &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/washington/clinicians/tina-shah-4743741" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Tina Shah&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist based in Seattle with Kaiser Permanente. She points to feeling lightheaded or experiencing pain in the jaw, neck, or back, which may be radiating from the chest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows the risk of stroke also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30973048/" target="_blank"&gt;rises this time of year&lt;/a&gt;, and strokes present differently than heart attacks. To spot signs, there's a mnemonic device known as FAST.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you notice facial drooping, which is the F, or if you have arm or leg weakness on one side or sudden speech difficulty, then it's time to call 911" fast, says Lloyd-Jones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Amid holiday travel and gatherings,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/09/1198047149/blue-zones-health-centenarians-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt; healthy habits may &lt;/a&gt;fall by the wayside. With disrupted routines, people may &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/11/06/1134094540/statins-vs-supplements-new-study-finds-one-is-vastly-superior-to-cut-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;forget medications&lt;/a&gt;, such as heart and blood-pressure drugs, says &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/luke-laffin/4268377" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Luke Laffin&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's important to make sure that you have enough medicines for your entire trip," Laffin says, and if you're flying, pack them in your carry-on so you're not stranded without them if checked luggage goes missing.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As a physician, Laffin has witnessed the rise in admission to the ER during the holidays. He stresses the importance of not delaying or avoiding care. Some people talk themselves out of going to the ER, thinking symptoms will pass, which could be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"No one's ever going to fault you for going to the emergency department if your symptoms are concerning enough," Laffin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often, when people suspect a heart attack, that's exactly what it is. And seeking prompt treatment is key.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone comes to the hospital with an ongoing heart attack, the more quickly we restore blood flow with a stent, it can make the difference between someone living essentially a normal life versus living their life with heart failure," Laffin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: It's better to be safe than sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

But this video shared by @thegoldenbruvs shows otherwise. In it, Link and Otto, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; brothers, are just strolling along with their mom, totally loving life. Then, out of nowhere, they just freeze! It’s like they saw a ghost. Their cute little waddle instantly turns into stiff legs and these intense, “we’re in danger.” Whatever is up ahead clearly does not belong in their neighborhood, and they are waiting for someone — anyone — to handle the situation and protect them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Golden Retrievers can’t stop barking at the jacket hanging by the roadside&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the clip rolls, a car passes, and the moment escalates. Link and Otto hop backwards. One lets out a bark. The other joins in immediately. Full alert mode activated. Their mom pauses, slightly amused but cautious, while the other human keeps filming. When she takes a step forward, the hesitation is obvious. Link even glances back at his humans, that classic “are we really doing this?” look written all over his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As they get closer, they keep barking, clearly sure that they are guarding everyone around them. And then, the camera pans to reveal the threat: a black jacket draped over one of the yellow divider poles. To be fair, in low light, it may look a little suspicious. But it’s bright now, and the brothers want to err on the side of caution. The on-screen text says, “So glad they were there to protect us,” and it makes the whole thing funnier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s just so on-brand for these guys. Goldens have this hilarious habit of thinking they’re way tougher than they actually are when something “dangerous” (like outerwear) shows up! Sweater weather or not, safety comes first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The video has over 154K likes. And the comments are full of people sharing similar stories of Goldens bravely confronting rakes, decorations, and other household menaces. It turns out these two aren’t alone. The world is full of very good dogs, standing guard against jackets everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/199479-golden-retrievers-protect-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retrievers ‘Protect’ Owner From a Jacket in Cute Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Golden Retrievers ‘Protect’ Owner From a Jacket in Cute Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 06:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQWWhtNzd3QkJiZFdiRXhTRnFiQW0zNl9ZS2Z6Z0ltZk91b3Jrb2NvNFJVb3p0WFFQY2JhclF3N1cyeUt3Z2Y5Qm5WODZKcDRYN3h6SmYwS0kxUGpsWEpNRmlLR3BtZV9CdjJKY2NRRHQ5LWl3eHBzVHBfSVBTbnVCZXZ2dGpNTkdLZFFEaVI4VTdQU3lCRXBPTWZn</guid></item><item><title>当麻疹爆发时，德克萨斯州学校系统的缺勤率飙升-美联社新闻</title><link>https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-school-attendance-absences-0384199ace95b4088f60864ce9ec8315</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="LeaderBoardAd-Mobile "&gt;

In Texas and nationally, about two-thirds of measles cases have been among unvaccinated children. When measles is spreading, public health officials respond by excluding unvaccinated students from schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“The costs of that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/school-attendance-sick-day-chronic-absenteeism-270f6d07041760e90bf84d9f4108aa4d"&gt;absenteeism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are just not among the sick kids, but all the kids who are kept out of school as a precaution,” said Thomas Dee, a Stanford economist and education professor who co-authored the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles is airborne and poses severe risk for young children. In 2000, the illness was declared eradicated in the U.S., thanks to the widespread usage of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. In recent years, more parents have sought &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;exemptions to school requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the shots, and most states are &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;below the 95% kindergarten vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In Seminole Independent School District, only &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;77% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were vaccinated against measles in the 2024-2025 school year, according to state health department data. The measles upsurge there launched &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;the United States’ worst measles year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in more than three decades, sickening 762 people across Texas in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That number could have been even higher. The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/2025-measles-data-report-nov-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says there were an additional 182 potential measles cases reported in March 2025 among children in surrounding Gaines County that the state excluded from its count due to lack of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Absenteeism extended far beyond confirmed measles cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using state data, the study estimated 141 Seminole district students had confirmed measles cases. It found the increase in school absences was approximately 10 times what would be expected from just those students missing class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials recommend that people sick with measles or suspected measles isolate at home until four days after they get the telltale rash. State guidance calls for unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable students to be excluded from school for up to 21 days after exposure to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children from preschool to first grade had the most pronounced spike in absences — a 71% increase from the last two school years, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most student absences amid the outbreak were due to local health requirements for children to stay out of school if they may have been exposed to somebody diagnosed with measles, Seminole Superintendent Glen Teal said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the students who were directed to stay home, it’s unclear how many families may have kept children out of school on their own as a precaution. But there’s a good argument that parental concern played a role, said Jacob Kirksey, a Texas Tech University education policy professor who was not involved in the study but reviewed it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re hearing on the news or you’re seeing that there is just an illness outbreak more broadly, the parents are going to be predispositioned to just be more hesitant to send their kids to school,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other states with outbreaks see many kids miss school&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks in other states, such as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-utah-arizona-3bfc561ecc16d8e80175effdae0791d4"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, also have produced spikes in school absenteeism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 165 people — including 127 students from three schools — were in a 21-day quarantine as of Tuesday because they were unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable to getting sick. Some children have been quarantined twice due to new cases, said Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination continues to be the best way to prevent the disruption that measles is causing to people’s education, to employment and other factors of people’s lives in our communities,” Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing out on learning time can have long-term implications for a child’s success. Schools have been dealing with &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html"&gt;learning loss from the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which contributed also to elevated rates of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-students-chronic-absenteeism/index.html"&gt;chronic absenteeism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More frequent absenteeism also puts a strain on teachers’ ability to educate their students. Most educators aren’t trained on how to handle instructional pacing when a large chunk of their students are absent, Kirksey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have come up with a clever new way of freezing brain cells just as they fire out a signal, meaning processes that normally happen too quickly to observe can be studied in detail – and perhaps offer clues for treating conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;, where this signaling becomes disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process, called 'zap-and-freeze', involves jolting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/adults-grow-new-brain-cells-and-they-help-us-learn-through-listening"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; with electricity and then freezing them within milliseconds, under high pressure. Here, researchers led by a team from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in the US tested the technique on brain tissue from both mice and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tests revealed details of the workings of synapses that handle neuron-to-neuron communication, and of the vesicles that hold the chemical messages to be delivered. These interactions are fundamental for everything &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-found-a-way-to-help-erase-bad-memories"&gt;from memory&lt;/a&gt; to learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brainquake-discovery-could-change-what-we-know-about-schizophrenia"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Brainquake' Discovery Could Change What We Know About Schizophrenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This approach has the potential to reveal dynamic, high-resolution information about synaptic membrane trafficking in intact human brain slices," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.10.030"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Chelsy Eddings and colleagues in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, the researchers observed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocytosis"&gt;endocytosis in action&lt;/a&gt;, a recycling process that removes used vesicles and creates new ones, ready to send more messages to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_185340" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-185340" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronScan.jpg" alt="Neuron scan" class="wp-image-185340 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronScan.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/12/NeuronScan-600x335.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-185340" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers imaged cell activity milliseconds after stimulation. (Eddings et al., &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found evidence of ultrafast endocytosis – happening in less than 100 milliseconds – in both mouse and human brain slices, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00063"&gt;preserved in such a way&lt;/a&gt; that cells retain most of their normal structure and function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also identified a protein called dynamin1xA as being essential to this endocytosis process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By discovering these details for the first time, in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-mini-brain-is-made-from-real-tissue-and-it-has-huge-potential"&gt;brain tissue&lt;/a&gt; donated by people who had brain lesions removed, scientists now have a better understanding of the mechanisms that go awry in brain disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, it's encouraging that the results match up so closely between animals and people: The findings support the idea that mice are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/boosting-one-protein-reawakens-aging-brain-cells-in-mice-study-shows"&gt;useful models&lt;/a&gt; for human brain research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings indicate that the molecular mechanism of ultrafast endocytosis is conserved between mice and human brain tissues," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251201085855.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; cell biologist Shigeki Watanabe, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 'zap-and-freeze' method is just one of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.12.022"&gt;several techniques&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientists have been developing recently to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2301449121"&gt;capture snapshots&lt;/a&gt; of active synapses in near-living tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="185337" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease, knowing more precisely how these synapses and vesicles work together should help to shed some light on what might be going wrong in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;Parkinson's brains&lt;/a&gt; – and potentially, how to repair it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's still a long way off, but we know that neurons in the brain die as Parkinson's progresses, with cell death thought to be related &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.201898960"&gt;to some extent&lt;/a&gt; to faulty synapses. Parkinson's is a complex disease, though, and untangling the consequences of the condition from the driving forces isn't straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers hope to obtain tissue samples, with permission, from Parkinson's patients already undergoing invasive brain procedures. Those samples could show how vesicle activity differs in brains &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-signal-hidden-deep-in-your-brain-could-track-parkinsons-symptoms"&gt;affected by the disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Parkinson's already &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/parkinson-disease"&gt;affecting millions&lt;/a&gt; worldwide, and expected to become even more prevalent in the coming years, techniques such as 'zap-and-freeze' could be crucial in mapping brain activity on the smallest scales and shortest timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope this new technique of visualizing synaptic membrane dynamics in live brain tissue samples can help us understand similarities and differences in nonheritable and heritable forms of the condition," &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251201085855.htm"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Watanabe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2025.10.030"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This year, a new strain of influenza, known as influenza A H3N2 or the subclade K variant, according to &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/aggressive-flu-variant-sweeps-globe-211109238.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:Fox News;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, is spreading rapidly across the globe and in the United States. This week, the &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reported an 8.1% uptick in positive flu tests nationwide, with the new strain leading to &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flu-rising-around-us-experts-184607556.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:a rise in cases and hospitalizations;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;a rise in cases and hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from the inland western states to the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts previously predicted that &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-predict-years-flu-season-120000811.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:this flu season would be more severe;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;this flu season would be more severe&lt;/a&gt; than some previous ones, due to genetic changes to the virus that made it easier to infect people. And with the Southern Hemisphere seeing a rise in the flu subvariant this summer (which is the Southern Hemisphere’s winter, when the flu tends to circulate) experts believed that the same could happen here once our chillier months arrived. Australia, for example, &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/wake-call-australia-worst-flu-230428419.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:broke its national record for;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;broke its national record for&lt;/a&gt; flu cases this year, amid vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, there are things you can do to protect yourself. Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of the flu? How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a range of not-so-fun symptoms of the flu, including fever, muscle ache, cough, headache and exhaustion, per &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Some people also experience GI issues, like vomiting and diarrhea, or ear pain. The only way to know for certain that you have the flu is to take a test, after which your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication that can shorten the duration of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One clue that you may have the flu is &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/flu-season-officially-doctors-telling-121602089.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:how quickly the symptoms;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;how quickly the symptoms &lt;/a&gt;manifest. While the common cold may develop gradually, with a scratchy throat for a day or two before you really feel unwell, the flu can be quite sudden, causing you to feel fine one moment and awful the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can treat the flu at home with rest, liquids to avoid dehydration that can worsen symptoms and over-the-counter fever reducers and pain medication like ibuprofen. However, if you are experiencing severe symptoms like chest pain, confusion, severe dizziness, shortness of breath or dehydration, seek medical attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a flu shot effective in preventing the new strain of the flu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the flu vaccine still protects against severe outcomes from the illness, the current version of the shot is not up to date with the latest strain, as the vaccine was formulated before the  current strain started circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, getting vaccinated for the flu is still your best chance at &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flu-shot-040001043.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:preventing severe disease;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;preventing severe disease&lt;/a&gt;. It can also stop you from catching other forms of the flu that it’s a better match for, as different variants still circulate, albeit to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to stay healthy? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are simple measures you can take to prevent the flu.

(And it’s never a good idea to share drinks and food with other people during flu season!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, you can wear a mask when out in crowded places, or if you are immunocompromised or elderly and want an extra layer of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 00:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAJBVV95cUxOZXc3RWVTY1BmalllbTlfdTNtMlZEcnQtRHlEQzVlbzVhdjZWejJTZEVXYlRQTzhVb080eTJCS256T3ZBa0NnNXMxYnZ5ejRxblBLMzk0M3dzWm9wbzE5YmREWkdzN053TzdhNENvdWZfaHpzYTB6Y3p1bFY5SG51WEQ5RWZRWnU5Nk0zZ1JpOFhoSmNlaDhhWW10ZGVFQ1NXdUxZb1BZQVU1bHBHU0dHcHlUc2hZbVNteHI1U3ZUZTdlMmVJdkgwYnBqTWUxTFY1WGtZMVRGZ0JpOU04cVotTVQ1WWZTNDVaeHV0VWFCbXMtMkU0Z3ZFY1h2RGVrX3lPVWxTbUpYT3U3VW44</guid></item><item><title>科罗拉多州首次出现2025-2026年流感相关的儿科死亡病例；丹佛卫生局的医生提出建议- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-influenza-pediatric-death-denver-health/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Colorado health officials have confirmed the state's first influenza-associated pediatric death of the 2025-2026 season. The child, who was elementary school-aged and lived in the Denver metro area, died last week, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as flu activity surges statewide. CDPHE reports a 43% increase in flu-related hospitalizations during the last week of November, and pediatricians say they are seeing far more cases than usual this early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"At the moment, there's about 10 times as much flu as anything else," said Dr. Gregg Kennedy, a pediatrician at Denver Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy added that most children recover at home, but some require hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Annually throughout the whole country, we usually see several hundred pediatric deaths from the flu, and over 90% of them are kids that don't have the flu vaccine," he said. "If I had to give one recommendation to make sure our kids aren't going to die from the flu, the vaccine is going to be a really good idea for that." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schools are feeling the impact as well. At Colorado Kids Academy in Lakewood, owner Mara Hackett said the preschool had to close for a day when so many children became ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Children were coming in without any symptoms, and hours later they're developing really high fevers," Hackett said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said about 70% of students were out sick, and staff have returned to COVID-era cleaning protocols to keep families safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our number one thing is keeping kids safe and healthy," Hackett said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to curb the spread, CDPHE will begin sending text messages and emails this week to families of more than 225,000 children ages 6 months to 5 years whose records show they may be overdue for a flu shot. Doctors recommend getting vaccinated as soon as possible, keeping sick children home, and practicing good hygiene. Flu season typically peaks in January and February, but health officials warn this year's early surge could mean a longer, more severe season.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. appointed this year after he fired the previous ones — &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-panel-vote-hepatitis-b-vaccine-babies-rfk-jr-rcna247482" target="_blank"&gt;voted for the recommendation this month&lt;/a&gt;, upending more than three decades of agency guidance. Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill accepted the change Tuesday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— the final step for it to become the agency’s policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-887c24" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are restoring the balance of informed consent to parents whose newborns face little risk of contracting hepatitis B,” O'Neill said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-009d50" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5730a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommended the birth dose of the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; since 1991. Many public health experts criticized the advisory committee’s decision: After the meeting, a chorus of doctors, political leaders and health officials called on O’Neill to ignore the suggested change and maintain the CDC’s recommendation, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5ffb4" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC now suggests waiting until at least 2 months of age for babies’ first hepatitis B shots if they do not receive the birth dose. However, it still recommends that babies born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B or whose infection statuses are unknown get hepatitis B vaccines within the first day of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54f6e3" class="body-graf"&gt;The agency is still reviewing a secondary recommendation from the panel: that parents consult with health care providers about the possibility of testing children for antibodies to hepatitis B before they decide whether to get second doses of the vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given to babies as a three-dose series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-099f08" class="body-graf"&gt;The new policy is one of the most notable examples of the way CDC guidance is diverging from widespread medical consensus. The advisory committee's discussion of hepatitis B vaccines was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisory-panel-delays-vote-hepatitis-b-vaccines-rcna247362" target="_blank"&gt;rife with misinformation and cherry-picked data&lt;/a&gt;, and it ignored decades of evidence that hepatitis B vaccines are safe and effective when they are given shortly after birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-59171c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg" alt="CDC Panel Reverses Call To Give All Newborns Hepatitis B Shot"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Dec. 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Megan Varner / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4fff80" class="body-graf"&gt;Many public health experts say delaying the hepatitis B vaccine until babies are older could lead to a resurgence of infections and possibly more deaths from liver disease or cancer. Pediatric cases of acute hepatitis B plummeted after the CDC began recommending a universal birth dose, falling by &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;99% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Hepatitis B can be passed from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. There is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a33a35" class="body-graf"&gt;“Ending the recommendation for newborns makes it more likely the number of cases will begin to increase again. This makes America sicker,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1996974038413971766" target="_blank"&gt;said on X this month&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy is one of many medical professionals who publicly asked O’Neill not to adopt the advisory panel’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d14eab" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians are expected to keep recommending that parents vaccinate their newborns for hepatitis B. The Department of Health and Human Services has said the new recommendations will not affect insurance coverage of the shots. The vaccine will also continue to be offered to newborns through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free shots for uninsured or underinsured kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4667b" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B decision was the latest in a series of CDC policy changes that have not been backed by science, leading some public health experts to suggest that the agency’s guidance should no longer be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-596283" class="body-graf"&gt;After Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;gutted the long-standing membership&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s vaccine panel — formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — in June, he replaced it with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-793710" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Neill, a former investment executive who does not have a medical background, previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. He became acting CDC director in August after Kennedy abruptly fired the previous director, Susan Monarez. Kennedy said Monarez was fired for being untrustworthy, but Monarez said Kennedy dismissed her for refusing to blindly approve the vaccine advisory panel’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e16f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Last month, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;altered a webpage&lt;/a&gt; that had once unequivocally said vaccines do not cause autism, claiming instead that studies have not ruled out a link. (In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/do-vaccines-cause-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;decades of research&lt;/a&gt; have found no association.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66c028" class="body-graf"&gt;In October, O’Neill &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/separate-measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine-acting-cdc-director-rcna235971" target="_blank"&gt;called on vaccine manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to develop separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella, without evidence to support breaking up the combined vaccine. And in September, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/medicine-and-pregnancy/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;updated its guidance&lt;/a&gt; to tell pregnant women to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-acetaminophen-fda-pregnancy-autism-cause-rcna232909" target="_blank"&gt;consider avoiding acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; — the active ingredient in Tylenol — because of a possible connection to autism in children. (The bulk of scientific literature to date &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/acetaminophen-tylenol-pregnancy-autism-risk-rfk-jr-rcna229429" target="_blank"&gt;has not found a definitive link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db19ec" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;After decades of leaning on CDC guidance, many states have begun to defer to recommendations from &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-vaccine-split-realities-rcna228932" target="_blank"&gt;newly formed public health alliances&lt;/a&gt; or professional medical societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AAP continues to recommend a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, followed by additional doses at 1 to 2 months and 6 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 23:34:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNS1RhTjFtRGFoNXQwek9Wb21mVWZQa0tpMW9rZEJrMFExSTRqM1ptSUs1MTNpaG94TU8xQTJBa25BWi10aTN3ZWgzMUdXZmhfeEo0M1h2TzVZT2xzNkJnN0JCamI2b3FEQmVrUG9XMkhRVGVDTVI1ZlY3YzlsU1NEYVY5WTIxWVdSNmluMnl0TVhkNXAwcE9UTTlqSTVueWJzVjY3NmhFMkZfQdIBVkFVX3lxTFBTbm91VVhUY2gxd05WbjVvcENlQWJ6XzZ0ZVJQWEVEc3ctYkxWM0hPT245ZGJhY3ZSN0tPTlFNYkFHaFI4dVdEcjk1NEZNdXQ2RUJYSUFB</guid></item></channel></rss>
