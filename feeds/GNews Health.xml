However, she was told the back pain was due to gardening,&lt;/a&gt; despite having only done 20 minutes of this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next two months, her symptoms worsened and she stopped eating properly, lost weight, and developed a temperature, later losing all sensation in her legs and as well as bladder and bowel function. After being taken to the hospital and admitted for two weeks, she was given the devastating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;news that she had stage four non-Hodgkin lymphoma in her kidneys, and a tumour wrapped around her spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After one round of radiotherapy and further chemotherapy, she is now in remission.

I’d do a lot of hiking across the moors, I used to go cold water swimming all year round. One of the last things I did before I got ill was an abseil off a 120-foot viaduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t what I’m supposed to be doing at this time of life. I’ve not yet been able to get back to driving or anything like that. I’m completely reliant on my husband; it’s messed up my social life, just going out to meet friends or going swimming or popping into town to look around the shops. Emotionally, it’s just completely messed me up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms Davey said she wanted to spread awareness of her situation and help others who might be experiencing similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-left"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-awdjp1-0 PzkRY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/18/11/54/872d2dae-0e52-4636-aaff-8c656ef837e7.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-14147"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Karen Davey, 54, was told by her GP her cancer symptoms were menopause&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Spinal Injuries Association)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said, “I had no idea that hot flushes would lead to all this. The symptoms you’ve got aren’t always menopause symptoms, and we need to be more mindful of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just get annoyed that it was attributed to menopause and doing gardening when it needed looking into a bit more. I didn’t know anything about &lt;a href="/topic/spinal-cord-injury"&gt;spinal cord injury&lt;/a&gt; and when my toes started going tingly, it didn’t occur to me that that’s what it was. There’s not enough information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spinal Injuries Association supports people living with spinal cord injuries. Dharshana Sridhar, campaigns manager at Spinal Injuries Association, said, “Karen’s story is a powerful reminder that women’s health symptoms should never be dismissed or explained away without proper investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Too often, women with spinal cord injuries face delays in diagnosis and unnecessary barriers to equitable care, leaving them to cope with life-changing consequences that could have been prevented. Across the board, women’s concerns are frequently overlooked and when disability or other intersecting factors are involved, the barriers to timely diagnosis and treatment become even greater. Through our women’s health campaign, we’re calling for better awareness, earlier diagnosis, and accessible healthcare for every woman, no matter her disability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxOVTlJZ01ZTHJTaGJGQXRXZ1h0cmp5UTQxTzlOMjl0aE5iVnlMLWFZSUFwbTVjRW5TTlFhNmlhaWh0RlhHZFRSekx6QXpzam4xYmRoZUppaWxCcTRHRk9sLURZUFRqd1R2LTBNMmJKSVBhcHl1NXhRVjBjSEhzd1dWR1d6NjY3TVFUaUo0dzY3VExwVGZ0TFNPNEhySQ</guid></item><item><title>什么是“僵尸”兔子病，宠物可以感染它吗？ - MyNorthwest.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFBvMlBEeGMzeXN6UXpCZjI4YU8xNVMyRUt0bzdwYTRNamFBMElxZXNNOUhlOUVHSGFCei01UVYxRlV4UDhjRkRvSDQwWElWbDQzUW51eE16YjdWaW9kZ2hlXzBsVFJYVkNNemVV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story_body"&gt;

                        &lt;p&gt;A disease that turns rabbits into zombie-looking creatures is trending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horned, demon-looking rabbits were reported hopping around Fort Collins, Colorado, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rabbits-with-horns-virus-colorado-tentacles-papillomavirus-98b1ad95ba3a0f308bf884d79d1eea7c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press (AP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday. There have even been claims of the grotesque animals in Washington, according to &lt;a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/unusual-zombie-rabbits-spotted-washington-state/BR3GF7UTNFC3ZIZ6GBVHCRE65Q/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;KIRO 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus causes ‘zombie’ rabbit disease&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;Chase Gunnell, Communications Manager for the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), told &lt;em&gt;MyNorthwest &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Cottontail Rabbit Papillomavirus (CRPV) is nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;“The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;Shope&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt; papilloma virus (SPV), also known as cottontail rabbit papilloma virus (CRPV), has been present in the U.S. for around a century and is not new in Washington,” Gunnell wrote in an email.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunnell noted that while people have posted about the rabbits on social media in Washington — WDFW, &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;wildlife biologists, and veterinarians have not received any recent reports.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="cf0"&gt;“We cannot provide confirmation of a wildlife disease based on photos from social media alone,” he added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRPV gives rabbits rough, red lesions around the ears, eyelids, neck, and shoulder, according to the book “Ferrets, Rabbits, and Rodents,” &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cottontail-rabbit-papillomavirus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on ScienceDirect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growths don’t harm the rabbits unless they interfere with eating, Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told &lt;em&gt;The AP&lt;/em&gt;. Once the animals’ immune system fights off the virus, the growths subside.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                
&lt;h3&gt;‘Zombie’ rabbit disease cannot spread to other species&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for pets catching CRPV, Van Hoose said the virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit, but not to other species. Although the disease helped scientists research the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the &lt;span class="cf0"&gt;human papillomavirus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This makes gait retraining a very promising and effective option for early stage knee osteoarthritis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants in the study were aged 18 or over.

The intervention group were trained to change their foot progression angle (toe-in or toe-out) by 5 to 10 degrees to reduce the load on the knee. The sham group underwent the same training, but their natural angle of foot progression was unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the 6 training sessions, they were encouraged to practice their walking technique for at least 20 minutes per day until it became natural. During the 1-year follow up, they attended the laboratory 3 times, so researchers could check that they were maintaining the prescribed angle while walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the end of the study, the intervention group reported a larger reduction in pain than the control group, with the intervention group’s NRS pain score reducing, on average, by 2.5, and the control group’s by 1.3 from the beginning of the study.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More strikingly, MRI scans showed that the intervention group had less degeneration of their knee cartilage than the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An exciting finding of this study is the potential slowing of cartilage degradation with gait retraining. While this holds substantial potential, further study is necessary to understand whether or not the amount of demonstrated slowing will translate to improved clinical outcomes over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;– David Kruse, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Could this be an effective alternative to medication?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that gait retraining could become an effective intervention for managing knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Kruse advized that gait retraining is not always straightforward: “An individual’s gait, or walking pattern, is influenced by a unique chain of complex musculoskeletal structures. Understanding and examining normal gait patterns can be challenging. Consequently, making biomechanical changes to a person’s gait pattern can be very difficult.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding what changes are beneficial can be the first hurdle, followed by the challenge of establishing the alteration of gait as the individual’s new normal,” he advised. “Additionally, to address the complexities of the process, the analysis and re-training require specialized insight and expensive equipment. Therefore, modifying gait patterns is not a simple process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, Mazzoli told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, new technologies could help solve these problems:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Recently developed AI-based technology allows [us] to estimate knee loading and determine the best personalized foot angle for each patient. This could really allow gait retraining to become a readily accessible treatment. We really want to make use of this new technology, so that this gait modification can become widely available in the clinic for patients with knee [osteoarthritis].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/small-change-to-how-you-walk-may-help-relieve-osteoarthritis-pain/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:41:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFB0SXlwZHFJLTV2WTVxWTVLdHp1UFNjSXdZTl9jaGNYRHhzSEZzQTJTLWhZZ2VKVzg5dWdCS1M4UkNXSU00SmNnTlBCN0JhV1RZYm9hR3FrOWpsdURVU1JKMkFhaGRIM1F6OHdwTzRB</guid></item><item><title>具有这种身体特征的男性更有可能患上癌症，专家警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNWo0UThuSHljUGxKei1ob2hhdXpFN3pCMWo4cUlGajMwVnpBalRtU1ZDLUlVNk1weXJXd3VYT24taGdSc0tTV3k3dmRkWFRTanFFd3dNRk0wWjJzZ2JkLVdHajRnOWEwRmYyT1dnYjFucVM4UkpZandHSXhVdjItbW9aWUVSRWN6TU9za2NubEtidHFXX21DNmlXd3bSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFpuME1nMUJHNGI3SDNNbjB3S3U0Z1ZhbkN6V2hCVXpaVGJsQmhTN3pacFFqMll2cDIzTWFPSkt0VFZIYlFEM0czUGxtWGEya0hhcHpvdWRVYnVKb0xOSlQzbWcxbnFVQ21uNG9oVURBV2YwOFNtWV9faF9WelgxcGNzV05CMzB6cTNJVnNMV3RCVDFCOHMxNm95bW1MNFhlOW1R?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading doctor has warned that 'man boobs' can be a sign of potentially deadly testicular &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a3682a90-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, breast cancer or liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gynecomastia—when boys or men develop big breasts—can also cause sore or swollen nipples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/nhs/index.html" id="mol-a36ae9b0-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; says it is 'common' and does not always need treatment, sometimes it can be caused by underlying health issues which need addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These can include kidney disease, thyroid problems or cirrhosis—permanent scarring of the liver often due to liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a recent video posted on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-a36ce580-7c0c-11f0-9523-d3e1bcb093ce" class=""&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; which has amassed more than 228,000 views, Dr Surak Kukadia, an NHS GP known as Dr Sooj shared other potential sinister causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The little-known symptom, he said: 'Is such an important sign to be aware of because it could be a sign for so many different things, including things like liver disease, testicular cancer and even breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And yes, men can get breast cancer. It is so important you are aware of that because if you notice any kinds of lumps or bumps in your breasts, it's so important to get checked out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He continued: 'When you go and see your clinician, we can take a history, we can examine you, and we can even do some investigations like blood tests and hormone profiles.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After posting the video, he received lots of comments from social media users, who shared their personal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The NHS GP warned it can be an important sign of several potentially life-threatening illnesses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One user wrote: 'I was diagnosed in 2022 and had an orchiectomy to remove the cancerous testicle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Unfortunately, we were too late, and it had spread into my lymph nodes and caused me to undergo a Retroperitoneal Lymph Node Dissection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Please, please check yourself lads.

Many men forget to do the simple weekly checks to check for any lumps.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a concerning rise in cancers among young people which has left many experts baffled. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men, it is usually treatable with a high survival rate, killing 65 men in the UK each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of men diagnosed with penile cancer early, more than 90 per cent go on to survive at least five years after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the outlook for men with the most advanced cancer where it has spread to other parts of the body is bleak, so it is important to catch it early.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other signs of testicular cancer include a lump or swelling, an enlarged testicle, ache or pain in the testicle or the scrotum feeling heavy, firm or hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, breast cancer kills 85 men each year in the UK, with the vast majority of cases occurring in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms in men can include a lump or swelling in the chest or armpit, nipple discharge ,which may have blood in it, sores or ulcers on the chest and a change in the shape or look of the nipple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And there has been a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://britishlivertrust.org.uk/information-and-support/statistics/"&gt;sharp rise&lt;/a&gt; in liver disease related deaths, with it estimated to kill more than 11,000 Britons each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it was once largely thought to be an illness that affected the elderly and heavy drinkers, it is now rising rapidly among younger adults, with cases in children doubling over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Liver Trust estimates the condition now affects one in five people in the UK, worryingly with 80 per cent thought to remain undiagnosed because it often has no obvious symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But signs of liver disease include fatigue, feeling weak all the time, loss of appetite, subsequent weight loss, loss of sex drive, itchy skin, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice—yellow skin and whites of the eyes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 10:14:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNWo0UThuSHljUGxKei1ob2hhdXpFN3pCMWo4cUlGajMwVnpBalRtU1ZDLUlVNk1weXJXd3VYT24taGdSc0tTV3k3dmRkWFRTanFFd3dNRk0wWjJzZ2JkLVdHajRnOWEwRmYyT1dnYjFucVM4UkpZandHSXhVdjItbW9aWUVSRWN6TU9za2NubEtidHFXX21DNmlXd3bSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFpuME1nMUJHNGI3SDNNbjB3S3U0Z1ZhbkN6V2hCVXpaVGJsQmhTN3pacFFqMll2cDIzTWFPSkt0VFZIYlFEM0czUGxtWGEya0hhcHpvdWRVYnVKb0xOSlQzbWcxbnFVQ21uNG9oVURBV2YwOFNtWV9faF9WelgxcGNzV05CMzB6cTNJVnNMV3RCVDFCOHMxNm95bW1MNFhlOW1R</guid></item><item><title>从Ozempic嫉妒到幽灵般的朋友： GLP-1如何重塑关系-波士顿环球报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE15YWZfMjNXSmRQcktNM3pyaDlONHBPVGQ0WUFwMjdFT3huRFBPWWVIUWVNNjczcmFTMHlhc1pwcS1HaFU4d3dDeGVmbjI1Z1lxVWNwM0NMRm81alRvcDM4eGJMSUEzVlZFYTFfaVRIV1Y5VDhIal9TOTV2TzY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

In a Boston suburb, a wife who is struggling to lose weight for lack of a GLP-1 prescription finds herself being happy for — but also sort of resenting — her husband, who’s dropping pounds easily on a weight-loss drug. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I get up early to exercise while he’s in bed or watching the news,” she said. “It gets frustrating. I’m cutting my portions in half, and he wants to go out for ice cream.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Meanwhile, Amanda Torrey, 48, a nanny and a &lt;a href="https://theamandabookverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://theamandabookverse.com/"&gt;romance writer &lt;/a&gt;from Blackstone, is fighting an inner battle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She’d like to lose 25 to 50 pounds, but instead has been gaining weight. Recently, she saw one of her many friends who is taking a GLP-1. The friend was 100 pounds thinner than she’d been, and looked “adorable,” Torrey said. “And she was feeling great.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Torrey couldn’t get the transformation out of her mind. “Maybe I should just do it,” she told her partner. He’d like to lose weight, too, but they reminded each other about the side effects and how they don’t want to start a drug they’d be on for life, or put themselves at the “whim” of an insurance company.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So that was that. Or was it? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Everyone else looks so good,” she said wistfully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

I have told my husband that it’s time for her to move out, but he doesn’t agree. So now I am stuck taking care of her and her dog, especially now that she has a full-time job. I need help encouraging my daughter to move along with her own life.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vzpi000r3b7919dx6b6t@published"&gt;Congratulations on being in remission! I would like to suggest that you don’t need help with your daughter—you need help with your husband! I’m sure your husband is a lovely man, but you would have solved this problem already if he hadn’t objected. So the key to your sanity will be getting on the same page &lt;em&gt;as partners&lt;/em&gt; regarding what you want your home life to be like. After that, you can make a plan to confront your daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="139" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vzrg000s3b79mks119i6@published"&gt;When you told your husband that your daughter needed to move out, what reason did he give for disagreeing with you? Maybe he thinks her presence is somehow good for your health or well-being. He might be under the impression that she provides a kind of companionship you benefit from. Or, perhaps his reasons have more to do with him; being the only caretaker in a home can be a lot of pressure and feel a bit lonely. He may feel relieved knowing that your daughter is there to share the burden, and thus be reticent to give that up. Whatever the case is, he needs to articulate why he wants your daughter to stay. And if she does stick around, he should be the one to either whip her behaviors into shape or make up for her oversights.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmed9vztd000t3b79cq2an2rd@published"&gt;A serious illness is a surefire way to put one’s life into perspective—for both the patient and their partner. It causes some folks to draw their loved ones closer, while others yell, “YOLO” and book a Tanzania safari. Still others work to cultivate a peaceful and tranquil home. There is no wrong response. But in this case, as with most relationship discord, communication is key. You and your husband might not be able to reach a full consensus just yet, but I bet you can get there after a few thoughtful, vulnerable conversations. At the very least, I hope he agrees that dirty dishes and laundry are not a gift you should be forced to “receive” at this stage in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions of Americans have altered vision, ranging from blurriness to blindness. But not everyone wants to wear prescription glasses or contact lenses. Accordingly, hundreds of thousands of people undergo corrective eye surgery each year, including LASIK—a laser-assisted surgery that reshapes the cornea and corrects vision.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The procedure can result in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/negative+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;negative side effects&lt;/a&gt;, prompting researchers to take the laser out of LASIK by remodeling the cornea, rather than cutting it, in initial animal tissue tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Hill, a professor of chemistry at Occidental College, presented his team's results at the fall meeting of the American Chemical Society (&lt;a href="https://www.acs.org/events/fall.html" target="_blank"&gt;ACS Fall 2025&lt;/a&gt;) held Aug. 17–21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human corneas are dome-shaped, clear structures that sit at the front of the eye, bending light from surroundings and focusing it onto the retina, where it's sent to the brain and interpreted as an image. But if the cornea is misshapen, it doesn't focus light properly, resulting in a blurry image. With LASIK, specialized lasers reshape the cornea by removing precise sections of the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This common procedure is considered safe, but it has some limitations and risks, and cutting the cornea compromises the structural integrity of the eye. Hill explains that "LASIK is just a fancy way of doing traditional surgery. It's still carving tissue—it's just carving with a laser."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if the cornea could be reshaped without the need for any incisions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what Hill and collaborator Brian Wong are exploring through a process known as electromechanical reshaping (EMR). "The whole effect was discovered by accident," explains Wong, a professor and surgeon at the University of California, Irvine. "I was looking at living tissues as moldable materials and discovered this whole process of chemical modification."&lt;/p&gt;

         &lt;/p&gt;
          
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the body, the shapes of many collagen-containing tissues, including corneas, are held in place by attractions of oppositely charged components. These tissues contain a lot of water, so applying an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/electric+potential/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;electric potential&lt;/a&gt; to them lowers the tissue's pH, making it more acidic. By altering the pH, the rigid attractions within the tissue are loosened and make the shape malleable. When the original pH is restored, the tissue is locked into the new shape.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Previously, the researchers used EMR to reshape cartilage-rich rabbit ears, as well as alter scars and skin in pigs. But one collagen-rich tissue that they were eager to explore was the cornea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the team constructed specialized, platinum "&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/contact+lenses/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;contact lenses&lt;/a&gt;" that provided a template for the corrected shape of the cornea, then placed each over a rabbit eyeball in a saline solution meant to mimic natural tears. The platinum lens acted as an electrode to generate a precise pH change when the researchers applied a small electric potential to the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about a minute, the cornea's curvature conformed to the shape of the lens—about the same amount of time LASIK takes, but with fewer steps, less expensive equipment and no incisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They repeated this setup on 12 separate rabbit eyeballs, 10 of which were treated as if they had myopia, or nearsightedness. In all the "myopic" eyeballs, the treatment dialed in the targeted focusing power of the eye, which would correspond to improved vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cells in the eyeball survived the treatment, because the researchers carefully controlled the pH gradient. Additionally, in other experiments, the team demonstrated that their technique might be able to reverse some chemical-caused cloudiness to the cornea—a condition that is currently only treatable through a complete corneal transplant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this initial work is promising, the researchers emphasize that it is in its very early stages. Next up is what Wong describes as, "the long march through animal studies that are detailed and precise," including tests on a living rabbit rather than just its eyeball. They also plan to determine the types of vision correction possible with EMR, such as near- and far-sightedness and astigmatism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the next steps are planned, uncertainties in the team's scientific funding have put them on hold. "There's a long road between what we've done and the clinic. But, if we get there, this technique is widely applicable, vastly cheaper and potentially even reversible," concludes Hill.&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, these are &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://splashblocker.com/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;largely used in healthcare settings &lt;/a&gt;to protect nurses and doctors from patients' flushed pathogens, says Paddy. There are also air &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;sprays &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40311782/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt; have been demonstrated to be effective in sanitising the air and surfaces&lt;/a&gt; in bathrooms, therefore helping to counteract the dissemination of pathogens via toilet "sneezes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another option is to just flush and then leave the stall immediately. "I usually do the flush and run," says Gerba. He also recommends waiting 10 minutes before going into a public toilet after somebody else, though that might be tricky to achieve in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;If you bring your phone to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Then there are mobile phones. It's not recommended to use your phone while in the toilet stall, says Roberts – your phone is already exceptionally dirty, as you take it with you everywhere, rest it on every ledge, and touch it all the time. If you bring it to the toilet, you'll risk it touching pathogens that have been sprayed around the stall, and then you'll carry them around with you even after washing your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The simplest thing you can do is to always wash your hands immediately after you go to the bathroom, says Gerba, who notes that the average person in Tucson, Arizona, only spends 11 seconds washing their hands, while the Centers for Disease Control in the United States &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;suggests handwashing for 20 seconds&lt;/a&gt;. "Only about one in five actually wash their hands adequately," says Gerba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, to prevent catching a disease in the public restroom, wash your hands. Better still, add an extra step of applying hand sanitiser too, as the combination is &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/data-research/facts-stats/hand-sanitizer-facts.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;significantly more protective than handwashing alone&lt;/a&gt;. And try not to let the fear of pathogens lurking in toilets keep you up at night – your risk is (probably) lower than you think. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="*-disclaimer.-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only,-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-gp-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;* Disclaimer.

Eye specialists emphasize that conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and even certain cancers can be detected early through a comprehensive eye exam. These changes are usually invisible to the patient but can be identified by trained professionals using advanced imaging tools. Detecting these early signs allows timely intervention, protecting both vision and overall health, and sometimes even saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="28369076" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Eye-signs" source="Orion"&gt;Eye signs&lt;/keyword&gt; that unmask systemic diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes offer a unique, non-invasive window into the body’s overall health. A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine highlights that multiple systemic diseases, ranging from diabetes and hypertension to cholesterol disorders, autoimmune conditions, and cancers, often manifest subtle signs in the eyes before other symptoms appear. Retinal blood vessels, for instance, can reveal early vascular problems since they are directly observable, unlike most internal blood vessels. Eye care professionals trained to recognize narrowing, deposits, or abnormal pigmentation in the retina are often the first to identify these risks. Regular eye exams therefore provide critical early warning signals that support broader disease prevention and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;5 Basic yoga poses that bring down BP naturally&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Diabetes: detected years before other symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetes is often dubbed the silent disease because it can cause organ and tissue damage long before noticeable symptoms appear. According to the National Eye Institute of the US, diabetic retinopathy is one of the earliest detectable complications. High blood sugar damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina, causing swelling, leakage, or abnormal vessel growth. Studies, including a 2025 Medscape review, show these retinal changes can precede classic diabetic symptoms and even blood test diagnosis. Early detection through routine eye screenings is essential, particularly for people with risk factors like obesity or a family history of diabetes. Timely intervention can prevent vision loss and reduce the risk of serious complications associated with prolonged high blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol visible in the eyes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure and high cholesterol often develop silently, causing serious health risks without obvious symptoms. The eyes, however, can reveal early signs before complications arise. Hypertensive retinopathy, caused by prolonged high blood pressure, damages tiny retinal vessels, leading to narrowing, thickening, or bleeding. Similarly, high cholesterol may manifest as yellow deposits on the eyelids (xanthelasma) or cholesterol plaques inside retinal vessels, known as Hollenhorst plaques. The Frontiers in Medicine review and expert insights from clinics like Heart of Texas Eye Care emphasize that detecting these subtle eye changes early can prompt lifestyle or medical interventions that reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and vascular complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cancer and neurological diseases can be spotted too&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eyes may also provide early warning signs for certain cancers and neurological disorders. Eye cancers, such as retinoblastoma or ocular melanoma, may first appear as abnormal pigment changes or lesions in the retina. Additionally, systemic cancers sometimes metastasize to the eyes, and subtle retinal pigment abnormalities, such as patterns resembling a bear’s paw, have been linked to colon cancer. Neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis and brain tumors, can cause early symptoms like double vision, unequal pupil responses, or sudden reading difficulties. Research shows that visual field testing and detailed eye exams can identify these issues before patients notice significant symptoms, highlighting the critical role of the eye in early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Glaucoma and other silent threats detected early&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma, often called the silent thief of sight, progresses without obvious symptoms until irreversible vision loss occurs. The disease develops when intraocular pressure rises, damaging the optic nerve. A 2019 study noted that systemic factors like age, hypertension, and high cholesterol may increase glaucoma risk. Normotensive glaucoma, where eye pressure remains normal, may result from low blood pressure or conditions like sleep apnea. Early detection through eye exams, including optic nerve evaluation and pressure measurements, allows timely treatment, often preventing permanent vision loss. This reinforces why glaucoma screenings are a key part of routine eye care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why regular eye exams matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2024 review in Frontiers in Medicine confirms that comprehensive eye exams serve as a frontline tool for detecting hidden health risks. Routine eye care does more than preserve vision; it can uncover early signs of diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, cancer, and neurological disorders. Eye specialists are often the first to detect subtle changes that other tests might miss.

On August 14, 2025, the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC), along with a slew of trusted partners, dropped their 2025 guideline for preventing, detecting, evaluating, and managing high blood pressure in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/one-exercise-could-boost-memory-and-reduce-dementia-risk-says-doctor/amp_articleshow/123302302.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/diabetes-dietitian-recommends-four-foods-to-lower-blood-sugar-to-non-diabetic-level/articleshow/123293218.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read: Diabetes dietitian recommends four foods to lower blood sugar to non-diabetic level&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the US, nearly half of adults (46.7%) have high blood pressure, and it’s still the single most modifiable risk for death worldwide. This new guideline doesn’t just outline targets, it puts you at the center, blending lifestyle, science, and real-world tools. Whether you’re looking after your own health or supporting a loved one, it's about feeling empowered, not overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Common Blood Pressure Medications Linked to Low Risk of Total Knee Replacement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cloves-10-health-benefits-of-eating-them-daily/amp_etphotostory/123298472.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read: Cloves: 10 health benefits of eating them daily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention first, but be ready to act fast&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still the star of the show: lifestyle. Think heart-healthy diet, less salt, exercise, stress management, you know the drill. But the new guidance encourages early treatment, when needed, to help ward off not just heart attacks and strokes, but also kidney issues, type-2 diabetes, and even memory decline and dementia. Yes, that's right. Your brain, too, is in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;What do you think is the most important step in managing high blood pressure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A smarter risk calculator: PREVENT&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet PREVENT, the brand new risk calculator debuting in 2023, now officially part of the guideline lineup. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It estimates your 10- and 30-year risk of heart trouble by weighing age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and even zip code, as a nod to social determinants of health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sharper lab tests&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kidneys and hormones get a closer look: the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio test is now routine for all hypertensive patients, not optional anymore. . On top of that, the aldosterone-to-renin ratio test, used to detect a specific hormone-driven type of high blood pressure (primary aldosteronism), now applies to more people, especially if you also have sleep apnea or stage 2 hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain health gets a spotlight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, your blood pressure isn’t just a heart and kidney issue, it’s a brain issue, too. Even slight increases can chip away at memory and cognition. That’s why the guideline now targets a systolic (upper number) goal of under 130 mm Hg, especially to protect your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Medication gets personalized&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many adults, especially those juggling type-2 diabetes, obesity, or kidney disease, one pill might not do it. The updates encourage starting with drug classes like ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium-channel blockers, or thiazide diuretics. If stage 2 hypertension (140/90 mm Hg or up), a combo pill, two drugs in one, is often the way to go. And for some individuals struggling with obesity, adding newer options like GLP-1 medications (yes, the ones often in the headlines) may make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy gets a careful tune-up&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension during pregnancy is no joke, with risks like preeclampsia or even preterm delivery. The guideline steps up: recommending low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) for some, tighter blood pressure control during pregnancy (140/90 mm Hg threshold), and continued monitoring postpartum, because high blood pressure can hang around after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The lifestyle hot sheet: Real, doable, effective&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s your personal game plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salt: Keep it under 2,300 mg/day, ideally closer to 1,500 mg.

However, research shows that drinking beverages hotter than 65°C (149°F) may do more than burn your tongue; it could increase the risk of oesophageal cancer. According to the study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/7185/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and global studies, regularly consuming very hot drinks can damage the oesophageal lining. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeated exposure may cause inflammation and cellular changes that lead to cancer over time. Experts recommend allowing hot beverages to cool before sipping, as this simple habit could significantly reduce the risk of this serious and often overlooked health threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hot drinks may increase the risk of oesophageal cancer: Understanding the connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that hot water or very hot drinks can lead to cancer may sound surprising. But the World Health Organization (WHO) has been studying this link for years. It classified beverages consumed above 65°C (149°F) as "probably carcinogenic to humans." That means there is credible evidence that repeatedly drinking very hot liquids may increase cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consumed at such high temperatures, hot beverages, including plain hot water, can injure the lining of the oesophagus. Repeated damage can cause inflammation, affect cell structure, and potentially lead to oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, a type of throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Oesophageal cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oesophageal cancer is a serious condition that affects the muscular tube (oesophagus) connecting the mouth to the stomach. There are two main types:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma: more common in the upper and middle parts of the oesophagus, and closely linked to &lt;keyword id="28359543" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="hot-beverage-consumption" source="keywords"&gt;hot beverage consumption&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oesophageal adenocarcinoma: typically occurs in the lower part, and is often related to acid reflux or obesity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The squamous cell type is the one most strongly associated with scalding-hot drink intake. Early symptoms can be subtle, such as difficulty swallowing, a persistent sore throat, or unexplained weight loss. Because symptoms often appear late, oesophageal cancer is frequently diagnosed in advanced stages, making it more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s not the beverage, it’s the heat: Why beverage temperature matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand: the drink itself is not the issue; it’s the temperature. Whether it's herbal tea, coffee, soup, or plain water, consuming it at scalding temperatures poses the same risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In countries like Iran, China, and parts of South America, where it's common to consume very hot tea or water, studies have found higher rates of oesophageal cancer. This supports the conclusion that the temperature of the liquid, not its ingredients, is the critical factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expert insight: How hot is too hot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what counts as “too hot”? Research suggests that 65°C (149°F) is the upper limit of safe temperature. However, many people drink freshly poured tea or coffee at temperatures ranging from 70°C to 85°C, which is dangerously high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinks that are too hot to sip comfortably can burn the oesophagus, even if you don’t feel it immediately. This repeated injury to the oesophageal lining may increase the risk of long-term complications, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why temperature awareness is critical for prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oesophageal cancer ranks as the eighth most common cancer globally and has one of the lowest survival rates when detected late.

But the numbers tell a different story. Every year in the United States, more than 375,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and another 106,000 face gynecologic cancers such as ovarian, endometrial, or cervical cancer. While the majority of these cases are found after menopause, younger women are not immune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that only breast cancer and cervical cancer have routine screening tools. For most other gynecologic cancers, the first clue is a symptom, and those symptoms are often vague, easily mistaken for stress, diet changes, or common conditions. That’s why listening to your body and acting on unusual changes can be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some surprising warning signs that shouldn’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 01:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在大提顿小屋（ Grand Teton lodge ）内发现蝙蝠群后，数百人可能已经暴露于狂犬病中-雅虎加拿大新闻</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5IQ191ajB0RDBJS0l0elpJeHZpaVBYb0hpU21BVjJYbG10UHdSODliV0ZFbEFoUzROZkVBN0VnXzFkM3pLLWpHd1pZa2hMTzBIVGJReGxFUXZ4MjNEcE9GbUlfWjJNMjNJMURaLW5IdEtzTVZSdm9qYXFHZjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Hundreds of people may have been exposed to rabies after a suspected bat colony was discovered inside a lodge in Grand Teton National Park in recent months, national park and state health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bat colony was found over the past few months in cabins at the &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/grte/planyourvisit/jacksonlakelodgeplan.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jackson Lake Lodge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Jackson Lake Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, a popular eco-hotel and historic landmark located in Grand Teton National Park, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Park Service;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;National Park Service&lt;/a&gt;.

Further investigation revealed that the colony was nesting in an attic space above those eight guest rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The rooms were closed as a precaution while public health officials investigate and provide recommendations for mitigation, according to the National Park Service. The agency noted that there was no immediate threat to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Wyoming Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are leading the effort to coordinate with the affected guests' local public health officials, who will conduct rabies risk assessments," the agency added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;State health officials are reaching out to guests for rabies risk assessments and will determine whether they meet the criteria for preventive treatment, the National Park Service said.

Bats help with natural pest control by eating insects — such as mosquitoes — every night, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The most common species of bats found in Grand Teton National Park are little brown bats, followed by big brown, silver-haired, hoary, Yuma, long-legged, and long-eared bats, the agency said. Other bats, including California myotis and western small-footed bats, have also been found at the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The National Park Service noted that less than one percent of bats have rabies and has advised park visitors to follow guidelines to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/rabid-bats-sparked-public-health-095106987.html" data-ylk="slk:avoid exposure to rabies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;avoid exposure to rabies&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Observe wildlife from a safe distance.

In Wyoming, the National Park Service said rabies are most commonly found in bats and skunks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though rabies is fatal, the CDC says that it is a preventable disease, and has advised people to receive a pre-exposure vaccination for increased protection, vaccinate pets, and immediately seek medical care if exposed. The disease mostly impacts the central nervous system, and causes severe brain disease and death if medical care is not received before the onset of symptoms, according to the National Park Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It can take weeks to months for rabies symptoms to appear after the initial exposure, the agency said. The National Park Service added that bats are a "special concern" for rabies exposure due to the small size of their scratches and bites, which may not be noticeable to people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Even though rabies in animals is rare, animal exposure, especially involving bats, is treated very seriously due to the fatal outcome if the animal is rabid," according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/08/17/rabies-bat-colony-grand-teton-lodge-warning/85701872007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bat colony found in Grand Teton lodge, possibly exposing rabies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Bat colony found in Grand Teton lodge, possibly exposing rabies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 00:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE5IQ191ajB0RDBJS0l0elpJeHZpaVBYb0hpU21BVjJYbG10UHdSODliV0ZFbEFoUzROZkVBN0VnXzFkM3pLLWpHd1pZa2hMTzBIVGJReGxFUXZ4MjNEcE9GbUlfWjJNMjNJMURaLW5IdEtzTVZSdm9qYXFHZjQ</guid></item><item><title>首次同类细胞移植为糖尿病带来更紧密的治愈- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxQb04zOFZkNm91OTVWdFpxSUZiSEgtbkY0WDRaSEtGR3BXZ0VIRGVNSFZReFliYmh6dkJiaTYwMmFhM1pKRzJ6VFNEUlp4VnZBQ01pOFJYYjdpUjFsOFF1aFZNVHo1N09ZVjE5V284blA4UTB3eUtzYnZoemlUMnVfZWg4SURLcVU4b0pkWFB6X0l5UnNBZjdNQ09XV0w?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A patient with type 1  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; has begun producing his own insulin after receiving a transplant of pancreatic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in humans, these islet cells have been genetically edited so they wouldn't be rejected by the patient, removing the need for immunosuppressant drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 1 diabetes usually begins when the immune system mistakenly attacks the islet cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for producing insulin. The condition is usually managed with a careful diet and regular insulin injections, but an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-grown-functional-insulin-producing-cells-from-stem-cells"&gt;emerging treatment&lt;/a&gt; involves replacing the damaged islet cells with functional ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-treatment-may-cure-severe-type-1-diabetes-study-finds"&gt;New Treatment May Cure Severe Type 1 Diabetes, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new proof-of-concept study, a 42-year-old male patient, who had had type 1 diabetes since the age of 5, received a transplant of islet cells from a healthy donor. The cells were delivered through a series of injections into the muscle of his forearm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 weeks, the cells successfully produced insulin in response to glucose spikes, such as after meals. But the most important aspect is that the patient didn't require immunosuppressants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, the immune system will recognize the transplanted cells as foreign and destroy them, rendering the therapy ineffective. &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/guide-to-diabetes/managing-your-diabetes/treating-your-diabetes/islet-cell-transplants"&gt;To get around that&lt;/a&gt;, patients are given drugs that suppress their immune system. That solution works, but leaves the patients vulnerable to infections and other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, before the cells were implanted, three genetic edits were made using the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crispr-gene-editing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73025" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; tool. Two edits reduced the amount of particular antigens that adaptive T cells use to identify foreign objects. The third boosted production of a protein called CD47, which in turn blocks innate immune cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of the gene edits were successful, but in a way that provided an intriguing control group. Cells with no successful edits were killed off by T cells within a few weeks, while those that knocked out the antigen production were still wiped out by natural killer cells and macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only those with three successful edits survived, and thankfully there were enough of them in the graft to remain functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg" alt="Islet Cells" class="size-medium wp-image-171389" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-642x482.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-553x415.jpg 553w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1-600x450.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/Human_pancreatic_islet-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171389" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Pancreatic islet cells stained for glucagon  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="171085" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;antibody&lt;/a&gt; (red) and insulin antibody (blue) under the microscope.

Within four months, her body was able to produce enough insulin to stay within a safe blood glucose range for over 98 percent of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers on the new study say that their method could not only make for more effective, safer treatments for diabetes, but could be applied to other types of cells, reducing the need for immunosuppressants with other transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2503822"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A COVID infection, particularly in women, may lead to blood vessels aging around five years, according to research published in the &lt;i&gt;European Heart Journal&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Blood vessels gradually become stiffer with age, but the new study suggests that COVID could accelerate this process. Researchers say this is important since people with stiffer blood vessels face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, including stroke and heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was led by Professor Rosa Maria Bruno from Université Paris Cité, France. She said, "Since the pandemic, we have learned that many people who have had COVID are left with symptoms that can last for months or even years. However, we are still learning what's happening in the body to create these symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We know that COVID can directly affect blood vessels. We believe that this may result in what we call early vascular aging, meaning that your blood vessels are older than your &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronological+age/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronological age&lt;/a&gt; and you are more susceptible to heart disease. If that is happening, we need to identify who is at risk at an early stage to prevent heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study included 2,390 people from 16 different countries (Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Turkey, UK and US) who were recruited between September 2020 to February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were categorized according to whether they had never had COVID, had recent COVID but were not hospitalized, hospitalized for COVID on a general ward or hospitalized for COVID in an intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Researchers assessed each person's vascular age with a device that measures how quickly a wave of blood pressure travels between the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/carotid+artery/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;carotid artery&lt;/a&gt; (in the neck) and femoral arteries (in the legs), a measure called carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV). The higher this measurement, the stiffer the blood vessels and the higher the vascular age of a person. Measurements were taken six months after COVID infection and again after 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers also recorded demographic information such as patient's sex, age and other factors that can influence cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After taking these factors into consideration, researchers found that all three groups of patients who had been infected with COVID, including those with mild COVID, had stiffer arteries, compared to those who had not been infected. The effect was greater in women than in men and in people who experienced the persistent symptoms of long COVID, such as shortness of breath and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average increase in PWV in women who had mild COVID was 0.55 meters per second, 0.60 in women hospitalized with COVID, and 1.09 for women treated in intensive care. Researchers say an increase of around 0.5 meters per second is "clinically relevant" and equivalent to aging around five years, with a 3% increased risk of cardiovascular disease in a 60-year-old woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who had been vaccinated against COVID generally had arteries that were less stiff than people who were unvaccinated. Over the longer term, the vascular aging associated with COVID infection seemed to stabilize or improve slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Professor Bruno said, "There are several possible explanations for the vascular effects of COVID. The COVID-19 virus acts on specific receptors in the body, called the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, that are present on the lining of the blood vessels. The virus uses these receptors to enter and infect cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This may result in vascular dysfunction and accelerated vascular aging. Our body's inflammation and immune responses, which defend against infections, may also be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One of the reasons for the difference between women and men could be differences in the function of the immune system. Women mount a more rapid and robust immune response, which can protect them from infection. However, this same response can also increase damage to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood vessels&lt;/a&gt; after the initial infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Vascular aging is easy to measure and can be addressed with widely available treatments, such as lifestyle changes, blood pressure-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs. For people with accelerated vascular aging, it is important to do whatever possible to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Bruno and her colleagues will continue to follow the participants over the coming years to establish whether the accelerated vascular aging they have found leads to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an accompanying editorial Dr. Behnood Bikdeli from Harvard Medical School, Boston, U.S. and colleagues said, "Although the acute threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, a new challenge emerged in its aftermath: post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Defined by the World Health Organization as symptoms appearing three months post-infection and lasting at least two months, studies suggest that up to 40% of initial COVID-19 survivors develop this syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This large, multicenter, prospective cohort study enrolled 2,390 participants from 34 centers to investigate whether arterial stiffness, as measured by PWV, persisted in individuals with recent COVID-19 infection. […] sex-stratified analyses revealed striking differences: females across all COVID-19-positive groups had significantly elevated PWV, with the highest increase (+1.09 m/s) observed in those requiring ICU admission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The CARTESIAN study makes the case that COVID-19 has aged our arteries, especially for female adults. The question is whether we can find modifiable targets to prevent this in future surges of infection, and mitigate adverse outcomes in those afflicted with COVID-19-induced vascular aging."&lt;/p&gt;

However, treatment could also harm or lead to the death of her unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia and her husband ultimately made the difficult decision to terminate the pregnancy based on the many medical variables at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sophia was devastated by the &lt;a href="https://people.com/her-pregnancy-seemed-fine-then-everything-changed-exclusive-11767802" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:loss of her pregnancy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;loss of her pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;, she also acknowledged that it may have saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Yasin / SWNS&lt;/p&gt; Sophia Yasin&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because I was pregnant, I was prioritized [within the health care system].

Scientists found that microglia, immune cells in the brain, mistakenly remove nerve fibers connecting the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb—two regions essential for processing odors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This immune-driven pruning occurs when hyperactive neurons display altered membranes, marking them as defective even when they are not. By identifying this mechanism, the study highlights a pathway that could allow for earlier diagnosis and treatment before cognitive symptoms begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune Misfire:&lt;/strong&gt; Microglia break down nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus and olfactory bulb.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; These changes occur before cognitive decline, making smell loss a potential diagnostic tool.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Window:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may allow earlier use of amyloid-beta antibody treatments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;DZNE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A fading sense of smell can be one of the earliest signs of Alzheimer’s disease even before cognitive impairments manifest. Research by scientists at DZNE and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU) sheds new light on this phenomenon, pointing to a significant role for the brain’s immune response, which seems to fatally attack neuronal fibers crucial for the perception of odors. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, is based on observations in mice and humans, including analysis of brain tissue and so-called PET scanning. These findings may help to devise ways for early diagnosis and, consequently, early treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers come to the conclusion that these olfactory dysfunctions arise because immune cells of the brain called “microglia” remove connections between two brain regions, namely the olfactory bulb and the locus coeruleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The olfactory bulb, located in the forebrain, analyzes sensory information from the nose’s scent receptors. The locus coeruleus, a region of the brainstem, influences this processing by means of long nerve fibers originating from neurons in the locus coeruleus and extending all the way to the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The locus coeruleus regulates a variety physiological mechanisms. These include, for example, cerebral blood flow, sleep-wake cycles, and sensory processing. The latter applies, in particular, also to the sense of smell,” says Dr. Lars Paeger, a scientist at DZNE and LMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that in early Alzheimer’s disease, changes occur in the nerve fibers linking the locus coeruleus to the olfactory bulb. These alterations signal to the microglia that affected fibers are defective or superfluous. Consequently, the microglia break them down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alterations in the membrane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team of Dr. Lars Paeger and Prof. Dr. Jochen Herms, who is a co-author of the current publication, found evidence of changes in the composition of the membranes of the affected nerve fibers: Phosphatidylserine, a fatty acid that usually occurs inside a neuron’s membrane, had been moved to the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Presence of phosphatidylserine at the outer site of the cell membrane is known to be an “eat-me” signal for microglia. In the olfactory bulb, this is usually associated with a process called synaptic pruning, which serves to remove unnecessary or dysfunctional neuronal connections”, explains Paeger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our situation, we assume that the shift in membrane composition is triggered by hyperactivity of the affected neurons due to Alzheimer’s disease. That is, these neurons exhibit abnormal firing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A wide range of data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of Paeger and colleagues are based on a plethora of observations. These include studies on mice with features of Alzheimer’s disease, analysis of brain samples from deceased Alzheimer’s patients, and positron emission tomography (PET) scans of the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smell issues in Alzheimer’s disease and damage to the associated nerves have been discussed for some time. However, the causes were unclear until yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, our ﬁndings point to an immunological mechanism as cause for such dysfunctions – and, in particular, that such events already arise in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease,” says Joachim Herms, a research group leader at DZNE and LMU as well as a member of the Munich-based “SyNergy” Cluster of Excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives for early diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So-called amyloid-beta antibodies have recently become available for the treatment of Alzheimer’s. For this novel therapy to be effective, it needs to be applied at an early stage of the disease, and this is precisely where the current research could be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings could pave the way for the early identification of patients at risk of developing Alzheimer’s, enabling them to undergo comprehensive testing to confirm the diagnosis before cognitive problems arise. This would allow earlier intervention with amyloid-beta antibodies, increasing the probability of a positive response,” says Herms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this olfaction and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e08d8192839593ce8e8589949a859294a0849a8e85ce8485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Marcus Neitzert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dzne.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DZNE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Marcus Neitzert – DZNE&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-62500-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;” by Lars Paeger et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Locus Coeruleus noradrenergic axon loss drives olfactory dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) often begins with non-cognitive symptoms such as olfactory deficits, which can predict later cognitive decline, though the mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pathologically, the brainstem locus coeruleus (LC), the main source of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin (NA) modulating olfactory information processing is affected early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show early and distinct loss of noradrenergic input to the olfactory bulb (OB) coinciding with impaired olfaction in an AD mouse model, before appearance of amyloid plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mechanistically, OB microglia recognize and phagocytose LC axons. Reducing phagocytosis genetically preserves LC axons and olfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prodromal AD patients display elevated TSPO-PET signals in the OB, similarly to &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We further confirm early LC axon degeneration in post-mortem OBs in patients with early AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings reveal a mechanism linking early LC damage to hyposmia in AD, suggesting olfactory testing and neurocircuit imaging for early diagnosis and enable timely therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 20:15:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE0zeWhrMnF0VEJDX250U09NQWtmOUltMi1PU3lDb3JNaDBobmdzdEVQZnZnWUJwc29HLWk4M0ZjVG9zX1lTYVlCSWxzbU1JdjFIMHY0SExKX0JnVlBiVDdHaE82N0hVc3FJM3lHYjlJbEwxMGp1</guid></item><item><title>专家说，走路更快，活得更久- KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxOUkZCaENNR1ZDejNCLVk2X1JWMnIxMHVvY0toSXd2SDhYYTZzY2xjZ0RuQ2NDb3RnTXZ2WVVkQlpuMUlHdkktVXdvam14SWNia0hPUld4NVEtdXhRdEpkM2xBZlFocUV1enlKNENIajB1MUdmc21JaGxPSTlINC11Z1NMdlM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;ATLANTA — Too busy to go to the gym? Don't worry — you can stay healthy by incorporating at least 15 minutes of fast walking into your everyday routine, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it's recommended that people commit to 150 minutes of moderate activity per week to see sufficient health benefits, said Dr. Wei Zheng, the study's corresponding author. But if 150 minutes is too difficult to manage, fast walking a minimum of 15 minutes every day can have the same health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zheng and a team of researchers recruited mostly low-income and Black study participants from 2002 to 2009, according to the study published in the &lt;a href="https://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(25)00230-2/fulltext" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. The nearly 85,000 participants were given a comprehensive questionnaire about their exercise habits, average time spent working out, walking speed and health. Then the participants completed a questionnaire about 16 years later, and the analysis began in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know "fast &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51188871" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; is good compared to slow walking," but there isn't much research on how many minutes you should spend fast walking on average, said Zheng, director of the Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center and the Anne Potter Wilson Professor in Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Andrew Freeman, National Jewish Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, study participants who fast walked for at least 15 minutes every day saw a nearly 20% reduction in premature death compared with a 4% reduction among participants who walked slowly for a total of more than three hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've actually known for quite a long time that walking speed correlates with outcomes, meaning the faster you walk, the better you do. And it certainly makes sense, because you can imagine, somebody who's in really bad shape is probably not going to be able to walk very quickly," said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How walking can impact your health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has health benefits, such as managing weight and sugar intake, reducing the risk of cancer, easing joint pain and boosting immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts "know that when people are exercising regularly, blood vessels can relax and dilate a bit better. And then we also know that exercise is quite good for cholesterol, so it seems to lower cholesterol. And then overall, it reduces the risk of cancer and things that would otherwise hurt people," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking daily can also lower the risk of dementia or cognitive decline in people predisposed to developing Alzheimer's, according to recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in daily physical activity, such as walking, promotes better sleep and reduces inflammation, which improves brain structure, according to the Piedmont Medical Center in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to emphasize that these exercises, no matter slow or fast, all confirm some benefit," Zheng said. "But what we find is that fast walking as little as 15 minutes a day confirms substantiated benefits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast walking has been found to have specific benefits, such as decreasing the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(T)he thought is that exercise has a very big effect on blood pressure, as you may know, and blood pressure, it is one of the more exponential risk factors that we have, for roughly every 20 points blood pressure goes above 120 (what is considered normal or healthy), the risk of a cardiac event roughly doubles," Freeman said. "So, it's a super potent and exponential risk factor, and we know that regular exercise lowers that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get your heart pumping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, you can tell you're fast walking when you're able to talk but not sing, according to the United Kingdom's National Health Service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can increase your walking pace by a couple of steps and track it with a metronome, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/16/health/walking-cadence-mobility-speed-endurance-wellness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;July study.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I usually recommend that they get up before work, and they go for a brisk walk or a bike or a swim, or they do some high-intensity interval training, whatever it is that they're into," Freeman said. People can go to "a rec center, or they walk outside, if it is safe, or whatever it may be, and just weave it into their day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following good &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/perfecting-your-walking-technique#:~:text=Eyes%20up.,reduce%20your%20risk%20of%20injury." rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;walking form&lt;/a&gt;, such as standing tall with your shoulders back and swinging your arms, can help prevent backaches, make it easy to breathe and keep you balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walking is a full-body movement. It is not just about your lower body. It's not just one step in front of the one foot in front of the other," said Dana Santas, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, in a previous article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your arm swing is a huge part involved in the mechanics of walking. So, you want to have an arm swing that's coordinated with your foot movement, so it's opposing," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to take it up a notch? When doing any form of exercise, try to practice conscious or nasal breathing, which is when you inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. This helps regulate blood pressure and can prevent hypertension, according to Santas&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Air conditioning can feel heaven-sent on hot summer days. It keeps temperatures comfortable and controls humidity, making indoor environments tolerable even on the most brutally warm days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some people avoid using air conditioning (AC) no matter how hot it gets outside, out of fear that it will make them sick. While this may sound far-fetched to some, as a microbiologist I can say this fear isn’t altogether unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/what-to-know-about-a-surge-of-walking-pneumonia-cases-among-young-children"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What to know about a surge of walking pneumonia cases among young children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an air conditioning system malfunctions or isn’t properly maintained, it can become contaminated with infectious microbes. This can turn your AC unit into a potential source of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;numerous airborne infections&lt;/a&gt; – ranging from the common cold to pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sick buildings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sick-building-syndrome/"&gt;“Sick building syndrome”&lt;/a&gt; is the general name for symptoms that can develop after spending extended periods of time in air-conditioned environments. Symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, congested or runny nose, persistent cough or wheeze, skin irritation or rashes, trouble focusing on work and tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition tends to occur in people who work in office settings, but can happen to anyone who spends extended periods of time in air-conditioned buildings such as hospitals. The symptoms of sick building syndrome tend to get worse the longer you’re in a particular building, and are alleviated after you leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/how-germy-is-the-public-pool-an-infectious-disease-expert-weighs-in"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; How germy is the public pool? An infectious disease expert weighs in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10257240"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; from India compared 200 healthy adults who worked at least six-to-eight hours per day in an air-conditioned office with 200 healthy adults who didn’t work in AC. The AC group experienced more symptoms consistent with sick building syndrome over the two-year study period – particularly a higher prevalence of allergies. Importantly, clinical tests showed those who were exposed to AC had poorer lung function and were absent from work more often, compared with the non-AC group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other studies have confirmed that AC office workers have a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9518424/"&gt;higher prevalence of sick building syndrome&lt;/a&gt; than those who do not work in an air-conditioned environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s suspected that one cause of sick building syndrome is &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article/74/Supplement_1/0/7707269"&gt;malfunctioning air conditioners&lt;/a&gt;. When an AC unit isn’t working properly, it can release allergens, chemicals and airborne microorganisms into the air that it would normally have trapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/why-is-my-city-under-a-boil-water-advisory"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is my city under a boil water advisory?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malfunctioning air conditioners can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231099002745"&gt;release chemical vapours&lt;/a&gt; from AC cleaning products or &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/snap/refrigerant-safety"&gt;refrigerants&lt;/a&gt; into the building’s air. Chemicals such as benzene, formaldehyde and toluene are toxic and can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9171686/"&gt;irritate the respiratory system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poorly maintained air conditioning systems can also harbour bacterial pathogens which can cause serious infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legionella pneumophila&lt;/em&gt; is the bacteria that causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/index.html"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt; – a lung infection contracted from inhaling droplets of water containing these bacteria. They tend to grow in water-rich environments such as hot tubs or air conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Legionella infection is most often caught in communal places such as hotels, hospitals or offices, where the bacteria have contaminated the water supply. Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/legionnaires-disease/"&gt;Legionnaires’ disease&lt;/a&gt; are similar to pneumonia, causing coughing, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, fever and general flu-like symptoms. Symptoms usually begin to show between two and 14 days after being exposed to &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/caused-legionnaires-disease-outbreak-nyc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; What caused the Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in NYC?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/causes/index.html"&gt;Legionella infections&lt;/a&gt; can be life-threatening and often require hospitalisation. Recovery can take several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fungal and viral infections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of dust and moisture inside air conditioning systems can also create the right conditions for other infectious microbes to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, research on hospital AC systems has found that fungi such as &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Penicillium&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cladosporium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rhizopusspecies&lt;/em&gt; commonly accumulate within the water-rich areas of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8438419/"&gt;hospital ventilation systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/why-coughs-can-linger-long-after-you-recover-from-an-illness"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Why coughs can linger long after you recover from an illness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fungal infections can be serious in vulnerable patients such as those who are immunocompromised, have had an organ transplant or are on dialysis – as well as babies who were born premature. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/environmental-control/air.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aspergillus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; causes pneumonia, abscesses of the lungs, brain, liver, spleen, kidneys and skin, and can also infect burns and wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of &lt;a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/lungs-and-airways/pneumonia/"&gt;fungal infections&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/aspergillosis/"&gt;mostly respiratory&lt;/a&gt; and include persistent wheeze or cough, fever, shortness of breath, tiredness and unexplained loss of weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral infections can also be caught from air conditioning. One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S120197121730259X"&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt; revealed that children in a Chinese kindergarten class were infected with the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html"&gt;norovirus pathogen&lt;/a&gt; from their AC system. This caused 20 students to experience the stomach flu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While norovirus is usually transmitted through close contact with an infected person or after touching a contaminated surface, in this instance it was confirmed, unusually, that the virus was spread through the air – originating from the air conditioning unit in a class restroom. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6160878/#:%7E:text=Vaporized%20material%20from%20infected%20person's,3%2C%207%2C%2015%5D"&gt;Several other cases&lt;/a&gt; of norovirus being spread this way have been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/forget-sharks-7-things-water-swimmers-actually-fear"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Forget sharks: 7 things in the water swimmers should actually fear&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, air conditioners can also help &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ventilation/about/index.html"&gt;stop the spread of airborne viruses&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows AC units that are regularly maintained and sanitised can reduce circulating levels of common viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/indoor-air-homes-and-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;including COVID&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason AC may increase your risk of catching an infection is due to the way air conditioners control humidity levels. This makes inside air drier than outside air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending extended periods of time in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018320725"&gt;low-humidity environments&lt;/a&gt; can dry out the mucus membranes in your nose and throat. This can affect how well they prevent bacteria and fungi from getting in your body – and can leave you more vulnerable to developing a &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/5AB6706237E7ED5AF05FC19B9D4A88FC/S2633289223000017a.pdf/mouth-breathing-dry-air-and-low-water-permeation-promote-inflammation-and-activate-neural-pathways-by-osmotic-stresses-acting-on-airway-lining-mucus.pdf"&gt;deep-tissue infection&lt;/a&gt; of the sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air conditioners are designed to filter air contaminants, fungal spores, bacteria and viruses, preventing them from entering the air we breathe indoors. But this protective shield can be compromised if a system’s filter is old or dirty, or if the system isn’t cleaned. Ensuring good AC maintenance is essential in preventing &lt;a href="https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/ventilation-risk-health-care-associated-infections"&gt;air-conditioner-acquired infections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The pill was actually made up entirely of a synthetic opioid called nitazene that can be 40 times deadlier &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13911513/reason-fentanyl-deaths-decreasing-washington-state.html"&gt;than fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;. Lucci overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since then, McCallister has heard from other parents in her native Houston, Texas, who say their children’s deaths were also &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14582955/drug-nitazene-heroin-UK-US-fentanyl-epidemic.html"&gt;linked to nitazenes&lt;/a&gt;, a class of drugs that health officials worry could drive the next phase in the overdose epidemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In the past two weeks, I would say even the last week, with the interest in Lucci's story, other parents are reaching out to me because they've lost their children,’ she told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Houston has been hit particularly hard by the arrival of nitazene, which first began infiltrating the US drug supply in 2019. From May 2024 to 2025 alone, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-5a3afa80-788a-11f0-8e94-9fe044075bc6"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; DEA agents reported 15 nitazene overdose deaths in people aged 17 to 59, the highest death count since the first drug seizure in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lucci’s friend Hunter Clement, 21, was one of them. He took two pills sold to him in April, one a counterfeit Xanax and the other a counterfeit Percocet. He also overdosed and died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most standard post-mortem drug screens do not test for nitazenes, and the local authorities in Houston did not have the type of comprehensive panel that would detect nitazenes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, the two moms took the pills they found near their sons’ bodies to a specialized lab for testing. When the results came back as nitazenes, the women said they’d never heard of the drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci Reyes-McCallister, pictured with his mother Grey, unknowingly took a pill made up of a synthetic opioid rarely found in the drug supply before 2019. He died at age 22&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I'll never forget when the detective called,’ McCallister, who has a background in pharmaceuticals, said. ‘I had him repeat the name twice. I had him spell it two or three times. I was looking for an active ingredient in there, something I recognized the name of, and I didn't.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What they learned was that the pill that killed Lucci was pure nitazene. There was no fentanyl and zero trace of Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In hindsight, McCallister suspects this was not Lucci's first encounter with nitazene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, Lucci took a pill and suffered a non-fatal overdose that required five doses of Narcan, the antidote for opioid overdoses, to bring him back to life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister thinks nitazene had been pressed into that pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He bounced back because he was terrified, and he was doing better,’ McCallister said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I think the thing with people of that age is you want to have a social life, you hang out with people, and that usually involves alcohol, and I think that's when the inhibitions slip.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;McCallister is currently working with law enforcement to find out where her son had been buying the counterfeit pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lucci is pictured at his high school graduation. He aspired to be a tattoo artist and had been working in a prestigious apprenticeship when he died&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Lucci and his mother were very close. McCallister talked to him 'a gazillion times a day,' she told the Daily Mail, exchanging texts, calls, memes, and silly videos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Lucci’s family checked in with him ‘a gazillion times a day,’ his mom said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family exchanged calls, texts, memes, and funny videos. But on the day he overdosed, they began to worry when they hadn’t heard from him for hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was found dead in his apartment on January 26 with two pills nearby pressed to look like Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He had a fulfilling life. He had a family that loved him. He was doing great,’ his mother said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Clement, mourning her son’s death a few months later, learned of Lucci’s passing, she immediately connected the two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She reached out to McCallister and, from there, had two pills left near Hunter’s body tested more comprehensively for the toxins that a standard screen could not detect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clement found Hunter one April evening after a long day at work. Hunter had come home the night before, apparently drunk, sparking worry in his parents. Perhaps he had taken half a pill, she thought at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like Lucci, Hunter had been doing well. He had been introduced to the pills by a friend the previous year, likely not knowing they could contain fentanyl or nitazenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He had a few rough months, but he never overdosed or needed Narcan. And his personality hadn’t changed much. From December through his death in April, he was the same son they knew and loved, his mom told the Daily Mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter took what were sold to him as Xanax and Percocet and fatally overdosed in April at 21. Further testing found the pills were made up entirely of the same nitazene that killed Lucci&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter is shown third from left surrounded by his family. According to his mother, he was his niece's favorite uncle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But that night in April, his parents feared Hunter had made a sharp turn down the wrong path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘The next day, when I went to work, he was sleeping. My husband went and checked on him around noon. He was sitting up in his bed,’ Clement told the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And then, when I got home, I found him in his bed, and he must have taken one of each [counterfeit oxycodone and counterfeit Xanax].’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first version, or analog, of nitazenes was developed in the 1950s as a potent opioid painkiller, but was never used in medicine due to its dangerously high overdose risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But still deadlier analogs of the original, like N-pyrrolidino protonitazene, which killed Lucci and Hunter, have resurfaced since 2019, infiltrating the illicit drug supplies of Europe, the UK, and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Andrew Renna, Assistant Port Director for Cargo Operations at JFK Airport in New York City told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cbp.gov/frontline/buyer-beware-bad-actors-exploit-de-minimis-shipments"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection&lt;/a&gt; in May: ‘Earlier this month, we seized almost a pound of nitazene that was going to a private residence in South Carolina. It was shipped from the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Unfortunately, here at JFK, we’re seeing xylazine and nitazenes at least a few times a week in quantities ranging from just a few grams to upwards of a pound or more.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hunter's mother said he had a great sense of humor and took his role as an uncle very seriously. He had been doing well in the months leading up to his sudden overdose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US is still steeped in a years-long opioid overdose crisis that is believed to have killed more than 800,000 people since it began in 1999. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, the US overdose death rate decreased by four from 2022 to 2023, dropping from 32.6 to 31.3 fatalities per 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decline is promising, but the increasing danger of another deadly synthetic opiate has overshadowed public health officials' optimism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the threat of a new wave of the opioid epidemic taking form, parents like McCallister and Clement have channeled their grief into an awareness campaign by sharing their sons’ stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Sadly, it just takes one pill, or one line of something, or, heaven forbid, in the future, a hit off of a vape,’ McCallister said. ‘I mean, this is very dangerous territory we're wading into.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:56:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在曾经被遗弃的德克萨斯州小镇，甜蜜的复兴之花再次绽放--MySA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOcEl3VlQ0c1NrZ3dDUzF5RTlYakVNbmE3RWdKM0pnYUtWUlZHUkRldVpYWnM4cldnTFpRLUNvTXVlTVR2MnR3QTVOdmEtQ2R0ZWdfVWIwM3RhZ2luNEhFenNLOHZxdWVyWTVZQ3hrQW9XMnRadXRfQ2RwN2ViMGxsWUg4Q2czdUsyZnptVUNDMUQ2b0VOVHFFZg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exterior of the Waring Market, which offers gallery space for local artists.

Turns out they have a rare disease that causes growths all over — and likely the origin of Wyoming’s mythical jackalopes. (Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Up, Doc?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laurie Hess, an exotic pet veterinarian in Bedford Hills, New York, told Cowboy State Daily the disease is normally not life threatening to a rabbit. She said the emergence of these horn-like growths is similar to the way warts appear in humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s been around forever, it’s a virus, it’s nothing new and it’s being sensationalized because people are seeing what it can do to wild rabbits,” Hess said via phone. “These rabbits look freakish but usually these [growths] are benign things, sometimes they will kind of fall off and go away.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s just the way the body reacts and walls off this virus as it divides, and it forms this pile of protein that happens to be in the shape of a horn,” Hess added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In rare exceptions the growths can develop into malignant cancer but are otherwise harmless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The good news is, it’s not transmittable to people, it’s not transmittable to other pets other than rabbits,” Hess said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hess said the appearance of such growths is specific only to rabbits, even though different types of papilloma viruses exist in other species, including humans.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the strange twisting horns caused by Shope papilloma virus have drawn comparisons to the zombie Cordyceps fungus popularized by the HBO series “The Last of Us,” Hess said the disease is something entirely different.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Fungus is an environmental thing,” Hess said. “Even athlete’s foot is a fungus, it lives in the gym in the drain, and you step in it and you get it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shope papilloma virus“is not like a plague spread through the air, it’s not like that, it’s not like COVID where you breathe the same air as someone with COVID has,” she added. “It has to be a transmission and it’s usually through insects.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A late summer resurgence of mosquitos, therefore, creates prime conditions for the spread of the shocking malady. Hess added that owners of exotic pets, such as rabbits, should make sure to bring them to the vet at least once per year to monitor for similar strange diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Though Wyoming has yet to see any infected rabbits, the state Game and Fish Department confirmed to Cowboy State Daily in an email that it is monitoring the rabbits’ movement through northern Colorado. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;State officials do not have plans to intervene should the rabbits cross into the state, though, as Shope papilloma virus does not threaten any local wildlife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“While this infection does look alarming, it is not fatal unless it interferes with the animals' ability to eat and drink,” Public Information Officer Amanda Fry wrote via email “We do recommend that you do not handle these animals, and give them space if you come across one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ultimately it is not a serious threat to rabbit populations, nor their role in ecosystems.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;The legend of the jackalope might have started with pioneers in the 1800s seeing rabbits infected with viruses that can cause horn-like growths. (CSD File)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legend Of The Jackalope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though horned rabbit sightings can be explained by science, that doesn’t stop some Wyomingites from speculating they are connected to a greater mythos rooted deep in state history.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The city of Douglas, Wyoming, &lt;a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/06/11/jonesing-for-jackalopes-douglas-cant-get-enough-of-these-mythical-antler-rabbits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;credits the Herrick family&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the invention of the mythical jackalope, an animal with a jackrabbit's body and the antlers of an antelope. Luke Herrick, a third-generation taxidermist in Douglas, said the legend originated from his grandpa Doug, who one evening happened to toss a rabbit carcass next to a pair of antlers on the floor of his shed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“They decided to try mounting one up,” Herrick told Cowboy State Daily via phone. “My great grandmother, Doula Herrick, she was the one that named it. She said ‘let’s call it a jackalope.’”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mounted Jackalopes, Herrick added, have since become a signature offering of Douglas’s Herrick Big Horn Taxidermy. Herrick said a typical jackalope mount will cost about $55 to create, which he can then sell in his shop for $155.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We sell twice as much [jackalopes] as we do our little animals,” Herrick said. “I took it over from my dad and he was doing 3,000 jackalopes a year and he still couldn’t keep up.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While Herrick said he was unfamiliar with a connection between jackalopes and Shope papilloma virus, he said the legendary creatures feel as real to him as any other animal he mounts in his shop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It almost sounds funny but they’re real to us, to me,” Herrick said. “I grew up with it ever since I was born.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1uhbe1z3 _1uhbe1z2 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;div class="_1eyampx0"&gt;&lt;div class="splide"&gt;&lt;div class="splide__track"&gt;&lt;ul class="splide__list"&gt;&lt;li class="splide__slide n1n9p20"&gt;&lt;figure class="n1n9p21"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="p8ohjc5 p8ohjc0 n1n9p22 _10mr6051 vbxqml4 _10mr60539"&gt;Douglas, Wyoming, has adopted the Cowboy State's mythical critter — the jackalope — claiming it was created by a local taxidermist in 1939.

It doesn’t deliver jellybeans and eggs like its cousin the Easter Bunny, but instead sings cowboy songs, drinks whiskey and mates only during electrical storms. Rose said this mystique likely contributes to the jackalope’s staying power throughout the years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think people just love mythology,” she said. “It’s kind of a cool thing and you’ve got Greek mythology, you’ve got Loch Ness Monster, you’ve got all these things out there and it just grows.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have seen in the past couple of years people coming, just like they go look for The Mothman,” she added. “They’ll go on vacations based on these mythical creatures, so we have had people come here just to see the jackalope.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The legend has since become a major part of Douglas’s identity, even featuring the jackalope on part of its city emblem. Rose said the museum where she works produces an array of touristy merchandise from jackalope milk to tongue-in-cheek jackalope hunting licenses.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The license, issued by the City of Douglas, permits the bearer to hunt jackalope from 12-2 a.m. on “June 31.” Different iterations of the license will sometimes list penalties for noncompliance, such as the 2022 version which threatens a $13 fine or “13 months hard play in Douglas, Wyoming.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Herrick said the joke sometimes goes over the heads of eager hunters who set out in search of the rare game anyways.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I know one instance, a guy was out hunting, shotgun out, and he was walking through the sagebrush looking for a jackalope and a game warden pulled up and asked him what he was doing,” Herrick said. “The game warden told him the truth and that guy was pretty p—ed off.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it remains possible a hunter could mistake a rabbit with the Shope papilloma virus for a jackalope, hunters aren’t allowed to shoot it. Jackalope season, according to the city of Douglas, ended more than a month ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cottontail rabbit season, meanwhile, starts on Sept. 1 in Wyoming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="_1uhbe1z1 _1uhbe1z0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jackson Walker can be reached at: News@CowboyStateDaily.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Cowboy State Daily</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:54:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxPUHY1QUJiSkVQU19uUnM2LTVXdnM5bkp3T05iVWc4dUhlRXN5MTlGdVdNSmFIOW05eTVVVEktSWQ1MEtySTc2b01rdWU3c0g0eEp6THRQQXFLaWZtbDlCaGZFY1J1YU9yTGtJQTMxNk1kY1ktcnJTN01fSmFxWXB2WnRrc1VjS2pRLUdydUd6WENqYkVQTFBnZ1FlQzV6eW05WXBkMmR5NnU3T1ByM1pvb3FVZ0I</guid></item><item><title>纽约军团病集群增至100多例，包括4例死亡--WGAL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPZ0YtYWs3Q0N4LXZCR1JjZ1NIeDlkbEZuNTB6RGx5aldiREo1VWxhaXpKNjA4SG12Rk0zc18yTjFpRzBpaHF3eUFZLW9Ta3BGVUdoOUNKdGI5RTBhTGNMN25Sb2N6UnBwS2U4MS14N2tYT0plZU9CWnhaMUNfRmdjYWZGcw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content--body-inner"&gt;

						Health officials in New York City say a cluster of Legionnaires' disease in Central Harlem has grown to 101 cases, including four deaths.Health officials suspect the bacteria that cause the disease, Legionella, originated in cooling towers — devices that use water to cool large buildings and then disperse mist into the air. If the water inside becomes too warm, stagnant, or isn't properly disinfected, Legionella can grow and sicken people who inhale the mist.On Thursday, the New York City Department of Health confirmed positive tests of the bacteria in 12 cooling towers serving 10 buildings in the area, including NYC Health + Hospitals/Harlem.The health department says 11 of the 12 cooling towers have already been repaired, and the final tower was to be remediated by Friday.Health officials emphasized that plumbing systems are separate from cooling tower systems in affected buildings."This community outbreak is not related to a building's hot or cold water supply. Residents in these ZIP codes can continue to drink water, bathe, shower, cook, and use their air conditioner," it said.The current Legionnaires' cluster was first announced on July 25. Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Michelle Morse said inspectors are working with building owners to ensure compliance with testing and remediation."The good news is that new cases have begun to decline, which indicates that the sources of the bacteria have been contained," Morse said. "New Yorkers who live or work in the identified ZIP codes and have flu-like symptoms should contact a health care provider as soon as possible for timely diagnosis and treatment for the best chance at a good outcome."Legionnaires' disease causes flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, headaches, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. It is treatable with antibiotics, but if left untreated, it can lead to shock and multi-organ failure, according to the World Health Organization. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 10% of people who contract the disease die from complications, with older adults and people with weakened immune systems at higher risk.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of us eat enough protein. But there are exceptions, like illness or intense exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When your body doesn’t get the protein it needs, it sends you subtle hints. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include bad mood, frequent illness or trouble bouncing back from exercise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sometimes, getting the nutrients you need can feel like trying to balance a seesaw. Just when one side is steady, the other starts to tip out of balance. Protein is a perfect example. While most of us are meeting the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290496/this-is-how-much-protein-you-need-to-eat-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;minimum protein requirements&lt;/a&gt;, that doesn’t mean we’re always consuming enough &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt; to match our activity level, support our unique health needs or accommodate dietary restrictions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that your body will often send you hints that you’re not getting enough of this nutrient. However, they’re not always obvious, and some of them may be downright weird. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; So, we asked dietitians to share the under-the-radar signals that you need more protein. Here’s what to look out for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-youre-always-hungry"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. You’re Always Hungry &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever finish a snack or meal but still feel unsatisfied? Or, maybe you’re hungry again soon after you’ve eaten? “Not eating enough protein can leave you &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031222/reasons-why-you-wake-up-hungry/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;feeling hungry&lt;/a&gt;,” says &lt;a href="http://djblatner.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dawn Jackson Blatner, RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. “Protein boosts hormones that make you feel full, so skimping on protein can leave you constantly reaching for snacks.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.activeeatingadvice.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Leslie Bonci, M.P.H., RDN, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, agrees, explaining that higher-protein diets increase the secretion of the appetite-suppressing hormones. This can help you feel more satisfied after meals. And if your goal is weight or fat loss, she says, a “protein prescription” can help control hunger and appetite between meals and preserve muscle mass in the process. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-youre-always-getting-sick"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. You’re Always Getting Sick &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you get sick more often than normal, it may be another sign of inadequate protein intake,” says &lt;a href="http://kellyjonesnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Kelly Jones, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. After you eat protein, your body breaks it down into &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;protein building blocks&lt;/a&gt; called amino acids, she says. These amino acids are then used to create immune cells and antibodies, which are your body’s front-line defenders against illness. But if there are not enough amino acids on tap, your immune system may not be able to do its job effectively. This may raise your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7594934/how-to-actually-boost-your-immunity-and-not-get-sick/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;risk of catching colds&lt;/a&gt; or other infections. “It may also take you longer to bounce back when you do get sick,” she adds.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-your-muscles-ache"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Your Muscles Ache &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If your post-exercise &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sore-from-workout-what-to-do-to-feel-better-11721347" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle soreness&lt;/a&gt; is an issue, you may want to consider your protein intake. “Consistent muscle soreness or weakness, especially if you’re not heavily training, may hint at low protein, since it’s needed for muscle repair and recovery,” says &lt;a href="http://www.nutritionfp.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Tony Castillo, M.S., RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;. When your body doesn’t get sufficient protein from food, it may start to break down muscle tissue to get the protein it needs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This, in turn, may translate to sore muscles. Fortunately, research has found that consuming protein during or after exercise may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-drinks-for-sore-muscles-8364146" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;speed muscle repair&lt;/a&gt; and alleviate some of those muscle aches.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-youre-not-hitting-your-fitness-goals"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. You’re Not Hitting Your Fitness Goals  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;If you're putting in the work with a fitness routine that involves both cardiorespiratory and strength training, but not seeing improvements in muscle strength or body composition, inadequate protein intake may be the culprit,” says Jones. That’s because active people have higher calorie and protein needs. However, if those needs aren’t being met, your body may burn the protein you eat for energy instead of using it to build muscle, she explains. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-you-heal-slowly"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. You Heal Slowly &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether it’s after surgery, an injury or even a scrape, there are times when we all need to heal. During these periods, our protein needs increase. “If protein intake is inadequate, you won’t have #alltheheals,” says Bonci. Without enough protein, your body will lack the raw materials that it needs for tissue repair and remodeling. All of this can delay recovery and healing, which might be otherwise prevented by consuming enough protein, she explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-your-hair-skin-and-nails-dont-look-healthy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Your Hair, Skin and Nails Don’t Look Healthy  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Want the secret to lustrous hair, glowing skin and resilient nails? It might be more protein. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Not eating enough protein may cause your hair to thin and fall out faster,” says Blatner. “Protein is essential for building strong, healthy strands, and [many] protein foods also contain iron and zinc, which support hair health.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Similarly, if your nails are splitting, peeling or breaking more easily than usual, it could point to inadequate protein intake, says Castillo. “Protein is a key building block for keratin, the main structural component of nails.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, poor nutrition in general can have a marked impact on nail health. So, a well-balanced diet with adequate protein can only help.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jones notes that poor skin health can also be a sign you’re not getting enough protein. That’s because your skin is composed of structural proteins like collagen and elastin, which keep it smooth and firm. Without enough protein to supply the amino acids your body needs to make these structural proteins, your skin may start to sag, and fine lines and wrinkles may set in.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-youre-feeling-down-in-the-dumps"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. You’re Feeling Down in the Dumps &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve got a case of the grumpies, it might be your diet.  “Increasing your protein intake by even 10% may improve your mood and help get your emotions back on track,“ explains Blatner. While the reasons aren’t entirely understood, one study suggests that eating additional protein may help your body produce more of the mood-boosting hormone serotonin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s not the only way protein may help balance your mood. This nutrient also helps stabilize blood sugar levels, which may prevent the mood dips that often accompany blood sugar crashes.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While many of us get the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7821729/myths-about-protein-fact-or-fiction/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;minimum amount of protein&lt;/a&gt;, some of us need more of it. When this happens, some weird signs may appear. Sneaky signs that you’re not getting enough protein are feeling hungry all the time, muscle soreness, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292168/5-weird-signs-you-may-not-be-getting-enough-protein/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lackluster hair, skin and nails&lt;/a&gt;. You may also have difficulty hitting your fitness goals, bouncing back from injury or illness and even feel more depressed or moody. If you notice any of these signs, it’s a good idea to check in with your health care provider or a registered dietitian nutritionist. They can take a close look at your diet to see if insufficient protein is what’s causing your strange symptoms, and help you develop a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;healthy eating plan&lt;/a&gt; to get the protein you need to feel your best.&lt;br&gt;

That drink doesn’t just wake the body – it flips a switch in the mind. Researchers at Bielefeld University and the University of Warwick wanted to know why coffee feels so uplifting in the morning compared with the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team followed young adults in Germany for several weeks. Each person tracked their mood and reported whether they had consumed caffeine in the last 90 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-coffee-may-reduce-frailty-in-aging-adults/"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; and other caffeinated drinks boosted happiness and enthusiasm. The effect was strongest within two and a half hours of waking. Later in the day, the effect weakened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-morning-coffee-resets-our-mood"&gt;Morning coffee resets our mood&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-helps-bacteria-resist-antibiotics-in-your-gut/"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt; didn’t only improve positive feelings. It also reduced negative ones like sadness and being upset. But that change was smaller and less reliable. Unlike the morning lift in happiness, this effect didn’t depend on the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference may lie in how caffeine works. It blocks adenosine receptors in the brain. This lifts energy and increases dopamine activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is tied to alertness and mood. Together, these changes explain why the morning cup feels like such a mental reset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-do-people-react-differently"&gt;Do people react differently?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team expected to see differences based on mental health, anxiety, or caffeine habits. But they didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were somewhat surprised to find no differences between individuals with varying levels of caffeine consumption or differing degrees of depressive symptoms, anxiety, or sleep problems,” noted Justin Hachenberger from &lt;a href="https://www.uni-bielefeld.de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bielefeld University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The links between caffeine intake and positive or negative emotions were fairly consistent across all groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result suggests that caffeine’s emotional effects are widely shared. People who react badly to caffeine may avoid it, so they were not strongly represented in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-withdrawal-question"&gt;The withdrawal question&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also debated whether the morning boost is real or simply relief from overnight withdrawal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/coffee-may-help-you-live-longer-if-you-drink-it-this-way/"&gt;Caffeine&lt;/a&gt; works by blocking adenosine receptors, which can increase dopamine activity in key brain regions – an effect that studies have linked to improved mood and greater alertness,” explained Professor Anu Realo from the &lt;a href="https://warwick.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Warwick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even people with moderate caffeine consumption can experience mild withdrawal symptoms that disappear with the first cup of coffee or tea in the morning.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, coffee may feel good not only because of brain chemistry but also because it takes away the drag of going without caffeine during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-changes-depend-on-coffee-use"&gt;Mood changes depend on coffee use&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research showed that tiredness and social setting also change how caffeine feels. When people were more tired than usual, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/can-caffeine-slow-down-aging-yeast-may-hold-the-answer/"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; gave them a bigger mood boost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people were around others, the effect weakened. Social interactions may have already shaped mood, leaving caffeine less noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negative feelings like worry didn’t shift much. Researchers think these emotions are tied to long-term stress or life events. That makes them harder to change with one drink. Positive emotions, on the other hand, respond more quickly to stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-global-link-between-coffee-and-mood"&gt;Global link between coffee and mood &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around 80 percent of adults worldwide consume caffeinated beverages, and the use of such stimulating substances dates far back in human history,” said Professor Sakari Lemola from Bielefeld University, the study’s senior author. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even wild animals consume caffeine; bees and bumblebees prefer nectar from plants that contain caffeine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee is more than a drink. It is part of daily routines across cultures. Yet researchers warn against drinking too much. High doses can disturb sleep and increase dependence. Over time, stopping suddenly can trigger headaches, irritability, and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-boost-from-morning-coffee"&gt;Mood boost from morning coffee&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study shows caffeine works best early in the day. It makes people feel happier, more awake, and more enthusiastic. But the effect doesn’t grow stronger with each cup. It fades as the day goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people, moderation is the key. That first cup can brighten the morning, but too much can backfire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee may not solve deeper worries or stress, but it can lift the mood enough to start the day with energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-14317-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 16:42:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxOUnpQaG9MNFBpNHdHbXAzbjB0ZTJVZUUtSktNNDBhV3ZUclVCMDZJNG53S21MekNrNjJXYTZBTnN6cGx2cXZVTko3T2VNdW0zUUJKaWNYZGduS0RwYXFUVkpJWEM2b1BnWmU5VjNDSk9jU3BmTHR5N1p4Z3hweThxWmliZTRhclp2</guid></item><item><title>哈佛肠道专家的10种最佳早餐组合-印度时报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxNd2tsM0wyQjc3d0U0dlBNTktYX2ktTk9uc1Bkal90eE1jXzJ3dHBOTktQd2l3WlFpUU90Z2RWWmppUkxLOGw3eE9pWEZpT3dtUF8teG1JdnV1dWZjRHRTcTkxY2VRcjN0bVlrUF9YdFU1R1dkT0RzZlRESjZGYkFUc3V2X1RaNUxxaS1yVFFSaWplRm5FRnZ5VFR4NWg2bW1KSUdCdmF3VlMtMHdpOEpGRGNtcDRBRzBsY1NrTkl3SXJPZ194TVF0Q1RoTzBNbEFZc3M0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering what to have for breakfast that is equally healthy and tasty.?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxh30001b3b79obu6o8qk@published"&gt;I’m a 45-year-old gay man working through complex sexual trauma and am relatively new to sobriety. For the first time in years, I feel mentally ready to connect with others, and I’m seeking a casual friends-with-benefits situation—something low-pressure but meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxh76001c3b79hrnxv6nk@published"&gt;Here’s the issue: receiving oral sex is physically difficult for me. I’m well-endowed, and new partners often get excited to go down on me—but I tend to go soft during the act, no matter what I’ve tried (even Viagra). It’s not about shame or lack of attraction. It’s a trauma response. But of course, I can’t unpack all that with a hookup I just met, and many men take my reaction personally.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhb0001d3b79zahtfh88@published"&gt;It’s a similar story with giving oral. I’m a bottom and want to please my partners, but the act can trigger me. I want to be upfront, but not in a way that overshares or kills the mood. How can I communicate this early on in a way that’s honest but doesn’t derail the whole experience?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhld001g3b79tg296rft@published"&gt;It is reasonable, de rigueur even, to spell out what you are (and, in some cases, aren’t) into before a hookup. If you’re meeting guys via apps, this can be as simple as including info in your profile (“No oral, only anal,” for example), or letting them know during your coordinating chat. If you’re meeting guys in person, a brief conversation explaining your boundaries should also suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="197" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhpf001h3b79tmsc0tft@published"&gt;However, know that this may derail the experience for some potential partners. I think your main task is getting to be OK with that. If people can’t abide by your boundaries, they aren’t worth your time. People may filter themselves out if they’re looking for oral, and a lot of them will be. Guys, even the top-identified, may be drooling for your big dick, but bottoms who don’t want their dicks played with are fairly common. That’s not going to shatter a seasoned top’s understanding of the universe. I think you’ll find that what is more of a dealbreaker is you not wanting to suck, but I think you’ll still do fine even with that boundary stated up front. Anecdotally, I see tops in hook-up profiles advertising that they just want anal. They are out there. As with any interest/disinterest that deviates from the status quo, this is just about finding your people, and that process involves rejecting others as you shuffle through. Just be patient and know that if anyone turns you down as a result of your interests, it’s not personal. After all, they won’t yet know you well enough for it to be personal.&lt;/p&gt;

Prior to dating him, I lived a very sexually active life and was very involved in the hookup culture. While I don’t judge others for the choices they make when it comes to their sex life, I’ve come to realize my promiscuity was born from a desire to be accepted and from a desire for intimacy. It has taken a lot of work to work through the shame and the guilt I have felt from abusing my body and giving it away so liberally, but I’m slowly accepting my past as a part of my journey of growth and looking at my past self through kinder eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="141" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxhyx001k3b79lozavva8@published"&gt;With all that said, my partner and I have a very active sex life. Sex with him is by far the best I’ve ever experienced and it seems like each time he’s coming up with new ways to please me. On the other hand, while I have had quite a few hook ups in the past, they really haven’t required me to get very creative or to put in a lot of work. My partner only tops so I am the bottom in our relationship. Aside from riding, what other positions would work well for a bottom looking to please their partner? Also, while I love giving him oral, his penis does curve which triggers my gag reflex. I love this man so any suggestions on how to please him in the same way he pleases me would be most appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

You say that tops in the past haven’t &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; you to get creative. Is there anything different about this current relationship that would cause you to feel required to do so? If not, you’re probably fine—some tops just want to be able to do what they will with a hole, little-to-no work required on the bottom’s part other than being receptive. There’s a reason why topping has been traditionally considered the “active” role: It tends to require more physical work. Things don’t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; be this way, but what it could mean for you is riding low expectations all the way to mutual orgasms for you and your partner. I get the sense that you want to surprise your partner with new tricks, but in terms of the vibe and actual sensation, these may not be his thing. You would do better to have a conversation ahead of time about whether or not there’s anything he’d like you to do. The fact of the matter is that any and all positions could work well for a bottom looking to please their partner … depending on the top’s taste and the bottom’s willingness. You wrote a rave review of your sex life so this might be a don’t-fix-what-isn’t-broken situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="165" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxijo001o3b79mk32l43y@published"&gt;That said, you could try being the one to thrust in positions other than you on top—for example, if he’s in you from behind, you could move back and forth on his dick instead of him doing that work. See if he’s into it. And for oral, try coming at him another way. If you tend to approach from below (as in, him standing while you are kneeling or even if he’s lying down and you situate yourself between his legs), instead approach from above. Have him lay on his back and approach from the top (as if in a 69 position). That can help with accommodating, depending on his curve. You could also try laying on the bed with your head over the edge and have him thrust into you. Again, it will depend on his curve but that could help you take him (tell him to go easy, especially at first because an overeager top thrusting deep can also make things more difficult).&lt;/p&gt;

When you add that to busyness, dealing with childcare, and general exhaustion, we end up having infrequent sex that leaves one of us unhappy. I’m usually a hot and ready girl, but I’m just not in the mood given everything, and the pattern of me not being able to get turned on has really hurt my partner’s feelings and led to her feeling blamed and rejected. I just want to get back to feeling horny and having excellent sex! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

You have generously accommodated your partner’s limitations, but it seems that it’s at your expense. More tinkering may be in order. The troubleshooting that needs to be done is figuring out how you can mitigate your partner’s pain while facilitating your pleasure. This will require working together closely, and that I think might be the biggest hurdle here.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="178" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvts00223b79xyn2o4sr@published"&gt;It’s going to be hard to collaborate in such an intimate space when there are negative feelings pervading it. It’s likely that your issues here go way beyond positioning—the shame that has entered your bedroom could be just as big of an impediment, if not more so. Your partner’s reactions have not been ideal. It seems that she is honest in her expression, but she hasn’t been extending the kind of sensitivity that you need. She doesn’t have to &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; your squirting but she should accept it as part of your body’s functionality. Not doing so risks you feeling rejected. It seems that she has also taken personally your body’s reaction to the changes you’ve integrated. That’s a choice she doesn’t have to make. It may be disappointing, even upsetting, that your solutions for managing her pain didn’t fall perfectly into place for both of you, but this is a practical matter. At the very least, there’s an alternate interpretation for your response that doesn’t involve your body unconsciously snubbing her. Why is she opting for that one?&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="190" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevxvtt00233b791sus6uge@published"&gt;I don’t know what your dynamic is like, and I don’t know how your own behavior and reactions have contributed to it, but what I read was a letter from someone who has done a lot for their partner and it’s still not good enough. Whether you are being treated unfairly or are extremely sensitive to your partner’s feedback (or a little bit of both) is for you to determine. Clarity there will help further conversations on this matter. There may be ways to reconfigure your sex so that you are both satisfied. It won’t necessarily be at the same time—maybe one session is tailored to your pleasure, the next to her’s. Obviously, you may be limited by what her body has the capacity to endure, but she may also need to compromise a bit. Maybe there’s a position that is good for your pleasure/orgasms that isn’t strictly comfortable for her, but also isn’t so uncomfortable as to be unpleasant. If she won’t approach either your conversations about emotions or strategizing for sex with a sense of compromise and collaboration, that’s data. It indicates there’s more work to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmeevzw4r002o3b798cb2dg3g@published"&gt;I’m a bisexual married woman. Recently, it occurred to me that I might be kind of into my best friend. She’s attractive, and she actually has permission from her boyfriend to hook up with me. I was very flattered but I declined because my husband and I have never talked about that and I felt he’d consider it cheating, which is fair. But, I’ll be honest, I was kind of interested. I’d be open to it with her; only if my husband agreed. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and don’t know what the outcome would be. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/10/friend-permission-hook-up-sex-advice.html"&gt;What should I do?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
