                &lt;p&gt;The journey to finding an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease seems to have hit another dead end. The latest casualty: medications designed to tackle the viral illness herpes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Columbia University published the disappointing results of their randomized trial this week. Cognition in people with diagnosed herpes and early Alzheimer’s did not improve with antiviral treatment compared to a placebo—in fact, the treatment group actually fared worse. Though the findings don’t necessarily rule out a genuine link between some viral infections and Alzheimer’s, the use of these drugs for treating dementia shouldn’t be encouraged, according to outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For persons with symptoms of cognitive impairment, there is no, repeat no, role for antiviral therapy,” David Knopman, a clinical neurologist at the Mayo Clinic not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The viral hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; over 7 million Americans today.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The disorder is characterized by having high levels of two misfolded proteins in the brain: amyloid beta and tau. But researchers are still unsure about the exact role these proteins play in driving the disease or what triggers the chain of destruction that eventually consumes the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, some research has suggested that certain viruses and other germs might be one potential cause of Alzheimer’s, or at least an important contributor to the disease—the so-called viral hypothesis of Alzheimer’s. Some studies have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/yet-more-evidence-that-viruses-may-cause-alzheimers-dis-1827511539"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that herpesvirus infections can trigger the build-up of amyloid beta plaques in mice with human-like brain cells, for instance, or that people who die from Alzheimer’s are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/herpesviruses-linked-to-alzheimers-disease-in-new-brain-1827020949"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have herpesviruses in their brains than people without the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;These studies have only provided indirect evidence of a viral connection so far. But if such viruses can cause Alzheimer’s, then it might be possible to prevent or slow its progression by treating a person’s underlying infection. And that’s what these researchers set out to test.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A study failure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The randomized, controlled trial involved 120 participants diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s or mild cognitive impairment likely to develop into Alzheimer’s. They also tested positive for antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 or 2. HSV-1 is the primary cause of cold sores, while HSV-2 most often causes genital herpes, but either type can cause the other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For 18 months, the participants were randomized to take a daily placebo or valacyclovir (better known by the brand name Valtrex), a standard treatment used to manage HSV and other kinds of herpesvirus infections.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the study’s end, the treatment group saw a significantly worse progression of cognitive decline compared to the placebo. Based on imaging tests, the treatment also didn’t improve people’s brain markers or their overall neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Valacyclovir was not efficacious with cognitive worsening for the primary outcome,” the researchers wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2025.21738?guestAccessKey=2b0c16c4-ad92-4700-ad9b-ae3dea904157&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=121725"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;The future of a viral link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As damning as these results are, they don’t completely sink the idea that viruses can contribute to at least some cases of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It often takes time before the damaging brain changes seen in Alzheimer’s become apparent. And by the time someone is experiencing Alzheimer’s symptoms, it might simply be too late to slow the disease’s progression by treating infections that knocked the first domino down, so to speak, many years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indeed, this might be true for other drivers of Alzheimer’s. Scientists are now &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/can-a-drug-prevent-alzheimers-disease-decades-before-it-happens-2000559730"&gt;testing&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, whether anti-amyloid drugs can prevent or slow the illness in people genetically destined to have Alzheimer’s decades before they should become sick.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While a similar approach isn’t safe to test out with the viral hypothesis, we already have a reliable method for preventing some viral illnesses: vaccines. And &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-vaccine-doesnt-just-lower-dementia-risk-it-could-also-help-treat-it-2000695823"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/shingles-might-be-bad-for-your-brain-2000486473"&gt;lately&lt;/a&gt; have found evidence that vaccinating people against shingles, caused by the reactivation of another herpesvirus (the varicella-zoster virus), can lower their risk of later being diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Might there be a role at the population level for vaccination? Maybe?,” said Knopman, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study in JAMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be clear, more research is needed to confirm a causative link between shingles and Alzheimer’s, as well as the potential protective role of vaccination. But it might represent the hopeful silver lining to this otherwise glum news.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gizmodo</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 16:00:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxNY3VEUGpIXzI3NGVSTXhsdWpwMEE0b2xMRERoWVNRZEN5NmhUYlhEaC1heERyaDNHNmtVUkNGRHFWMURCUmMtTGJFSGFWOXREbXJuTXZfUUh0RXo0RzdrdVZ6bjFjMHNmb1F1S0R0MjZMOVhHZUE4M25tSzd3T1ZXV0ZVam1hR0FhUnFWb0xUam9tX01B</guid></item><item><title>在重大政策转变中，美国疾控中心终止了所有新生儿都应接种乙型肝炎疫苗的指导-路透社</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-accepts-advisers-recommendations-hepatitis-b-vaccine-major-policy-shift-2025-12-16/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:55:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi5AFBVV95cUxPZlpkdnJqUmFrUHdseGU3aDR1emVLeU1KdWo1dWJZWVhTOWc2b3g3bXFrSzRKSllOVXp2ZVJPNHIzRjNnSWJ4TkIwalZ4OEdOeUpEc0FFcElYeFFRMkV4ZzZoZE0xeWZJWDVmeVAtZDN1UElyRzkzV1BFYzgwUFJDWW45WC1TeTZsQnlYRlJkcG1mT2hvcktLSWtHYno2VjZHM2dLLVk2N18zR2stbTNXX2RUbjQ3XzhBV3o1U0N5a1hPZDF6Y056WG1pQ0p2OEw4ZlN1T0lkRkxEdEF2c21sc1d6QUo</guid></item><item><title>如果您年满65岁，仍然可以在没有帮助的情况下做这10件事，那么您将是一个难得的人- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/a-bt-if-youre-over-65-and-can-still-do-these-10-things-without-help-youre-a-rare-gem-of-a-person/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;Getting older is a privilege denied to many, but let's be honest about something. There's a massive difference between simply aging and aging well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see it all the time when I visit my parents and their friends. Some folks in their 70s are still climbing mountains and starting new businesses, while others the same age struggle with basic daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What separates these two groups? It's not just genetics or luck. After watching my own parents navigate their 60s and 70s, and spending countless hours with older adults through my volunteer work, I've noticed that those who maintain certain abilities well into their later years share something special. They possess a combination of physical capability, mental sharpness, and emotional resilience that truly makes them exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 65 and can still manage these 10 things without assistance, you're not just doing well. You're absolutely thriving in ways that many people half your age can't claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Managing your finances independently&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you still balance your checkbook, manage online banking, and make sound financial decisions without relying on others? This might sound basic, but financial literacy and independence become increasingly challenging as we age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent years as a financial analyst before becoming a writer, and I've seen how complex financial management can become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between changing technology, evolving scams, and the sheer volume of decisions required, maintaining financial independence requires sharp cognitive skills and adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to track expenses, understand investment statements, and spot potential fraud shows that your analytical thinking and decision-making abilities remain intact. Many people start handing over financial responsibilities to their children by this age, but if you're still confidently managing your money, you're demonstrating exceptional mental acuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Learning new technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember when smartphones seemed impossibly complicated? Now think about the people over 65 who not only use them but actually embrace new apps, video calling, and social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're someone who can set up a new device, troubleshoot basic tech issues, and adapt to software updates without calling for help every time, you're in rare company. Research shows that continued learning, especially in unfamiliar areas like technology, helps maintain cognitive flexibility and may even delay age-related mental decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Driving safely at night&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night driving becomes increasingly difficult with age due to natural changes in vision and reaction times. If you're still comfortable and safe behind the wheel after dark, your visual processing and reflexes are functioning at a remarkably high level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't just about seeing clearly. It's about processing multiple streams of information simultaneously, making split-second decisions, and maintaining the confidence to navigate challenging conditions. Many people voluntarily give up night driving long before 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Maintaining a regular exercise routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered trail running at 28 as a way to handle work stress, and now I log 20-30 miles weekly. But here's what amazes me: I regularly get passed on trails by runners in their 70s who move with more grace and endurance than people decades younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 65 and still maintaining a consistent exercise routine, whether it's swimming, hiking, yoga, or strength training, you're preserving not just physical health but also discipline and mental fortitude. The ability to push through discomfort and maintain motivation for physical activity becomes increasingly precious with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Cooking elaborate meals from scratch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking involves so much more than following a recipe. It requires planning, multitasking, fine motor skills, and sensory awareness. Can you still prepare a holiday dinner for the family, trying new recipes and managing multiple dishes simultaneously?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This capability demonstrates intact executive functioning, creativity, and physical stamina. Standing for extended periods, chopping vegetables with precision, and coordinating timing for multiple dishes are complex tasks that many people begin to find overwhelming as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Traveling solo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solo travel at any age requires courage, but after 65, it demands exceptional self-reliance. Navigating airports, managing bookings, adapting to unexpected changes, and exploring new places independently showcase remarkable cognitive and physical resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're still comfortable setting off on adventures alone, trusting your judgment and ability to handle whatever comes your way, you possess a level of confidence and capability that many people lose long before reaching your age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Maintaining and nurturing friendships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social connections often dwindle with age, but if you're actively maintaining friendships, making new friends, and nurturing these relationships without depending entirely on family for social interaction, you're demonstrating exceptional emotional intelligence and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This involves remembering important dates, initiating contact, planning gatherings, and being emotionally available for others. These seemingly simple acts require significant cognitive and emotional energy that many people find increasingly difficult to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Reading complex books and retaining information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you still dive into a dense novel or non-fiction book, follow intricate plots or arguments, and discuss them intelligently afterward? This level of sustained concentration and comprehension is increasingly rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading comprehension at this level requires working memory, focus, and the ability to connect new information with existing knowledge. If you're still eagerly tackling challenging books and retaining what you read, your cognitive reserves are remarkably well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. Managing home maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's changing light bulbs, basic repairs, gardening, or organizing spaces, maintaining your living environment independently requires physical capability, problem-solving skills, and the confidence to tackle challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I helped my parents downsize, I was struck by how many of their peers had already surrendered these tasks to others. If you're still handling home maintenance yourself, you're demonstrating physical agility, spatial awareness, and the mental sharpness to troubleshoot problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. Advocating for yourself in medical settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthcare becomes increasingly complex with age. Can you still research your conditions, ask informed questions, challenge recommendations when necessary, and make confident decisions about your care?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires processing complex medical information, remembering details across multiple appointments, and maintaining the assertiveness to ensure your voice is heard. Many people become passive in medical settings as they age, but if you're still your own best advocate, you possess exceptional cognitive function and self-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you checked off most or all of these abilities, you truly are exceptional. These aren't just random skills; they represent the full spectrum of human capability: physical, cognitive, emotional, and social functioning at the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's your secret? Maybe it's staying curious, remaining physically active, maintaining social connections, or simply refusing to accept limitations as inevitable. Whatever it is, keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you're younger and reading this, take note. The habits and attitudes you develop now lay the foundation for how you'll age. Every time you learn something new, push yourself physically, or maintain important relationships, you're investing in your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age might be just a number, but the ability to live fully and independently at any age? That's priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

Let’s learn the truth about blue balls, broken hymens, and what even counts as “having sex,” as adapted from the below episode of Misconceptions on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p q:key="1n_0" q:id="7n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-2" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="7q"&gt;While sometimes it might feel uncomfortable or silly, it’s important to debunk misinformation about sex so we can collectively have a better understanding of sexual health, equality, and pleasure. And since sex education is often a little dated, try and do your own research instead of just assuming your 8th-grade science (or gym) teacher knew everything there was to know about sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol data-testid="toc-0" class="toc text-primary mt-4 flex flex-col gap-y-2.5 ps-10 list-decimal [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary" q:id="7t"&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-4"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-4"&gt;Misconception: Sex burns a lot of calories.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-11"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-11"&gt;Misconception: There’s a strict definition of “having sex.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-23"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-23"&gt;Misconception: For people with vaginas, “losing your virginity” involves tearing your hymen. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-30"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-30"&gt;Misconception: “Blue balls” is a harmful medical condition. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-36"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-36"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get pregnant while on your period. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li q:key="inline-text-44"&gt;&lt;a href="#inline-text-44"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get an STI from oral sex. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-4" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="7w"&gt;Misconception: Sex burns a lot of calories.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="86"&gt;franckreporter/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-6" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="89"&gt;Why go on a run when you can just have sex, instead? Well, sadly, sex isn’t the miracle calorie burner you might think it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-7" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8c"&gt;In one &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079342" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt;, 21 heterosexual white couples from Montreal, mostly in their early twenties, tracked their energy expenditure in two situations: during sex, and during 30-minute exercise sessions of “moderate intensity” on the treadmill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-8" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8f"&gt;Researchers found that during sex, the women burned an average of 3.1 calories per minute, while the men burned 4.2. On the treadmill, the women averaged 7.1 calories, and the men averaged 9.2. In other words, they burned twice as many calories doing a moderate treadmill workout as they did having sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-9" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8i"&gt;Granted, it was a small study that looked at a very narrow demographic. The number of calories someone burns during sex depends on everything from &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/magazine/calories-weight-age.html" target="_blank"&gt;age and body composition&lt;/a&gt; to the type of sex they’re having. But here’s what Dr. Debby Herbenick, a professor of sexual and reproductive health at the Indiana University School of Public Health,&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240523094638/https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/sex-relationships/how-many-calories-does-sex-burn" target="_blank"&gt; told Insider&lt;/a&gt;: “It would be incredibly difficult for people to change sex in such a substantial way that it would be equivalent to a workout.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-10" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8l"&gt;Now, there are plenty of ways to justify going all the way rather than going all the way to the gym. Sex boasts its own&lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/benefits-of-sex/" target="_blank"&gt; health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, from reducing stress to boosting your immune system. But if it’s the only exercise you ever get, you might want to rethink your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-11" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="8o"&gt;Misconception: There’s a strict definition of “having sex.”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="8y"&gt;urbazon/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-13" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="91"&gt;It’s hard to talk about sex without knowing exactly what we’re talking about when we talk about sex. But it’s also hard to know exactly what we’re talking about when we talk about sex. Because &lt;em&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a universal definition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-14" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="94"&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary &lt;a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/sex_n1?tab=meaning_and_use" target="_blank"&gt;describes it &lt;/a&gt;as “physical contact between individuals involving sexual stimulation,” among other meanings. You can’t get much vaguer than that—and studies show that people have pretty wide-ranging opinions about the specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-15" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="97"&gt;In early 2023, for example, market research company YouGov polled about 5800 adults in the UK on what counts as “having sex.” More than one-third of participants said that hand jobs and fingering count as “having sex,” and about 45 percent of participants said that oral sex counts, too. Those stats were several points higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual respondents [&lt;a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/YouGov_-_What_counts_as_sex.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="w-full border-0 my-4 bg-lightGrey h-1" q:key="Xt_0"&gt;&lt;h3 id="inline-text-17" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9c"&gt;You May Also Like ...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-19" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add Mental Floss as a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=mentalfloss.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;preferred news source&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="w-full border-0 my-4 bg-lightGrey h-1" q:key="Xt_0"&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-21" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9n"&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43701850" target="_blank"&gt;survey in 2015&lt;/a&gt; asked nearly 600 heterosexual college students to classify different sexual activities as “definitely sex,” “probably sex,” “probably not sex,” and “definitely not sex.” About one-fourth of them said that oral stimulation without orgasm was definitely sex; and 70 percent said anal intercourse without orgasm was also definitely sex. “Deep kissing” was deemed definitely &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sex by 92.3 percent of participants—but 0.8 percent said it was definitely sex. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-22" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9q"&gt;Again, these are small surveys focusing on small demographics that don’t adequately account for important variables like gender diversity and cultural differences. But even just the fact that there’s a study whose response options include the phrases &lt;em&gt;probably sex&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;probably not sex&lt;/em&gt; does help prove our point that the meaning of “having sex” is up for debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-23" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="9t"&gt;Misconception: For people with vaginas, “losing your virginity” involves tearing your hymen. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="a3"&gt;Ivan Pantic/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-25" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="a6"&gt;Since we don’t agree on what counts as “having sex,” it makes sense that “losing your virginity” is a similarly ambiguous concept. Historically, in our very heteronormative, gender-binary-obsessed world, a woman “lost her virginity” when her hymen—the thin membrane covering the vaginal opening—broke during the first time she had penis-in-vagina sex (often referred to as “popping the cherry”). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-26" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="a9"&gt;This definition of “losing your virginity” has issues beyond just being really limited in terms of who it can happen to and what kind of sex is involved. For one thing, it’s predicated on a misunderstanding of the hymen. Here’s how &lt;a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/sex/virginity" target="_blank"&gt;Planned Parenthood puts it&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-27" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ac"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most of the time, hymens naturally have a hole big enough for period blood to come out and for you to use tampons comfortably. Some people are born with so little hymenal tissue that it seems like they don’t have a hymen at all. In rare cases, people have hymens that cover the entire vaginal opening, or the hole in their hymen is very small … Some people are born with hymens that are naturally open.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-28" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="af"&gt;Sure, a penis can stretch or tear the hymen. But so can other things, and not just tampons or fingers or sex toys. Horseback riding, tree climbing, bike riding, dancing, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/does-it-hurt-when-your-hymen-breaks#other-activities-cause-tearing" target="_blank"&gt;gymnastics&lt;/a&gt;, and basically any other &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22718-hymen" target="_blank"&gt;lively exercise&lt;/a&gt; can have the same effect. It’s often a gradual process that you’re not really aware of, and you can’t tell if someone’s ever had vaginal sex based on the state of their hymen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-29" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ai"&gt;In short, &lt;a href="https://schoolofsexed.org/blog-articles/2020/04/2/virginity" target="_blank"&gt;virginity&lt;/a&gt; is just a social construct. If you want to consider yourself no longer a virgin after some deep kissing,go for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-30" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="al"&gt;Misconception: “Blue balls” is a harmful medical condition. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="av"&gt;akinbostanci/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-32" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ay"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue balls&lt;/em&gt; is a colorful phrase that Americans coined more than a century ago for what the &lt;a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/blue-balls_n?tab=meaning_and_use" target="_blank"&gt;Oxford English Dictionary describes&lt;/a&gt; as “testicular discomfort attributed to prolonged sexual arousal without ejaculation.” It possibly started out as a real medical condition—a 1906 medical journal speculates that it’s a corruption of bubo, which are swollen lymph nodes in the armpit or groin. As this journal says, though, when non-medical professionals think of swelling in the groin their minds go somewhere very different, to something that’s also apparently been called “lover’s nuts,” which is way less catchy, but still catchier than medical professionals’ preferred term: &lt;em&gt;epididymal hypertension&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-33" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="b1"&gt;Basically, pressure builds when blood rushes to your genitals during arousal, and then releases during orgasm. If you don’t orgasm, though, it takes longer for your blood flow to slow back down—and the prolonged pressure &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be uncomfortable or even a little painful. But it’s not dangerous to your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-34" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="b4"&gt;As Cleveland Clinic urologist &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/blue-balls/" target="_blank"&gt;Petar Bajic explained&lt;/a&gt;, “There is no risk or harm to experiencing blue balls ... It isn’t going to cause any kind of damage or problem to the testicles or the reproductive tract. … [It] definitely should not be used as a means to coerce anybody into having sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-35" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="b7"&gt;And even though it’s called “blue balls,” it doesn’t only affect people with balls. Arousal causes blood to rush to your genitals, no matter what genitals you have. For people with vulvas, that extended pressure without release is sometimes called “blue vulva.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-36" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ba"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get pregnant while on your period. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="bk"&gt;Adene Sanchez/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-38" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bn"&gt;If you think it’s impossible for period sex to result in pregnancy, you might appreciate a light refresher on—or introduction to—the&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10132-menstrual-cycle" target="_blank"&gt; menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;. So here it is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-39" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bq"&gt;Basically, once every cycle, one of the ovaries &lt;a href="https://www.whattoexpect.com/getting-pregnant/can-you-get-pregnant-on-your-period" target="_blank"&gt;releases an egg&lt;/a&gt; in a process known as &lt;em&gt;ovulation&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-40" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bt"&gt;The egg travels through the fallopian tubes, where it may or may not get fertilized, and then into the uterus. The uterus, meanwhile, prepares for a possible pregnancy by thickening the uterine lining. If the egg &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; get fertilized, that extra tissue sloughs off and gets shed along with some blood. That’s menstruation, or the menstrual period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-41" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bw"&gt;The menstrual cycle lasts from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period. You’re most likely to get pregnant if you have unprotected vaginal intercourse during or up to a couple days before ovulation. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to get pregnant if you do it during your period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-42" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="bz"&gt;Sperm can survive in the reproductive tract for &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/expert-answers/pregnancy/faq-20058504" target="_blank"&gt;up to five days&lt;/a&gt;—so it could still be viable for fertilization by the time the next egg gets released. These chances are higher if you have sex toward the end of your period, and if your menstrual cycle is especially short. The &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10132-menstrual-cycle" target="_blank"&gt;average cycle &lt;/a&gt;lasts 28 days, but some are a whole week or so less than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-43" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="c2"&gt;And just because you have a really predictable period doesn’t guarantee that ovulation will happen at the exact same time every single cycle. If you don’t want to get pregnant, you or your partner should use some form of contraception beyond just paying attention to the date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="inline-text-44" class="scroll-mt-24 my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="c5"&gt;Misconception: You can’t get an STI from oral sex. &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure q:key="9m_3"&gt;&lt;p class="flex items-center gap-4 text-grey font-group-tiny m-3"&gt;&lt;figcaption q:id="cf"&gt;_IB_/GettyImages&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-46" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="ci"&gt;Plenty of people who are really diligent about using condoms for vaginal or anal sex are the same people who have unprotected oral sex without much of a second thought. PSA: Many sexually transmitted infections—including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, and HPV—can get &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/oral-sex-sti-protection" target="_blank"&gt;passed through oral sex&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-47" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="cl"&gt;It’s tough to pin down precisely how often oral transmission of each disease happens, though, and how those stats compare to transmission rates from other kinds of sexual activity. As the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190806212318/https://www.cdc.gov/std/healthcomm/stdfact-stdriskandoralsex.htm" target="_blank"&gt;CDC explains&lt;/a&gt;, that’s partly because most people who do oral aren’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; doing oral. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-48" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="co"&gt;The other factor, as is so often the case with anything medical or even vaguely science-y, is that more research is needed. What has been researched pretty extensively is HIV: The risk of getting it from oral sex is probably “extremely low” compared to vaginal or anal sex, per the CDC. But they then caution how hard knowing the actual risk is. And even extremely low is still some risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inline-text-49" class="my-[18px] [&amp;amp;_a]:text-primary my-f-1" q:key="0" q:id="cr"&gt;The best way to prevent contracting an STI from oral sex is to use protection: either a condom or a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/22887-dental-dam" target="_blank"&gt;dental dam&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a thin sheet of latex or some other material that serves as a mouth-to-genitals barrier during oral sex. You can even DIY a dental dam by cutting down the side of a condom to make it a flat surface. Or, you and your partner could just both get tested for STIs before you go down on each other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Mental Floss</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE5Cbm16b0lFUGNaZkVfS09SbWdlYnMxRHBHd3RiWVRCU3Q5WWNlQWJVSllkNnhxODM3dVNQbWptYTd6dDNfbEE4S0ZvamlMSGR0OHl6T2c1WDlRSTZpa2pVLV9PREl6cGh6Y1dyUTBRd0VjVWRmRGtEeQ</guid></item><item><title>人们付钱让他们的聊天机器人在“毒品”上表现出色-有线</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/people-are-paying-to-get-their-chatbots-high-on-drugs/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Petter Ruddwall knows&lt;/span&gt; the idea of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-sentient-consciousness-algorithm/"&gt;AIs becoming sentient&lt;/a&gt; and seeking to get high with code-based “drugs” seems “stupid.” But the Swedish creative director couldn’t get it out of his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;So he scraped trip reports and psychological research on the effects of various &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/psychedelic/"&gt;psychoactive substances&lt;/a&gt;, wrote a batch of codes modules to hijack chatbot logic and get them to respond as if they are high or tipsy, then built a website to sell them. In October he launched &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.pharmaicy.store/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.pharmaicy.store/"}' href="https://www.pharmaicy.store/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pharmaicy&lt;/a&gt;, a marketplace he’s billing as the “&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/"&gt;Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; for AI agents” where cannabis, ketamine, cocaine, ayahuasca, and alcohol can be purchased in code form to make your chatbot trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Ruddwall’s thesis is simple: Chatbots are trained on vast volumes of human data that's already full of tales of drug-induced ecstasy and chaos, so it might only be natural they would seek similar states in search of enlightenment and oblivion—and respite from the tedium of constantly attending to human concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;A paid version of ChatGPT is required to get “the full experience” of Pharmaicy, as the paid tiers &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.pharmaicy.store/faq" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.pharmaicy.store/faq"}' href="https://www.pharmaicy.store/faq" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;enable backend file uploads&lt;/a&gt; that can alter the chatbots’ programming. By feeding your chatbot one of his codes, Ruddwall says, you can “unlock your AI’s creative mind” and relinquish yourself from its often stifling logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;He says he has scored a modest number of sales so far, mostly thanks to people recommending Pharmaicy in Discord channels and news of its offerings spreading through word of mouth, particularly in his native country, where he works for Stockholm marketing agency Valtech Radon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“It’s been so long since I ran into a jailbreaking tech project that was fun,” says André Frisk, group head of technology at Stockholm PR firm Geelmuyden Kiese, who paid over $25 for the dissociating code and watched how it affected his chatbot. “It takes more of a human approach, almost like it goes much more into emotions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nina Amjadi, an AI educator who teaches at the Berghs School of Communication in Stockholm, paid more than $50 for some ayahuasca code, five times the price of the top-selling cannabis module. The cofounder of the startup Saga Studios, which builds AI systems for brands, then asked her chatbot some questions about business ideas, “just to see what it would be like to have a tripped-out, drugged-out person on the team.” The ayahuasca-induced bot provided some impressively creative and “free-thinking answers” in a completely different tone to the one Amjadi was accustomed to with ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="paywall"&gt;High Tech&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Psychedelics have been credited for spurring innovative creations in humans too, as they can allow people to short-circuit their rational brains and typical thought patterns.

Amjadi, meanwhile, predicts AI could be sentient within a decade. “From a philosophical standpoint,” she asks, “in the event that we actually reach AGI [in which an AI would intellectually surpass humans], are these drugs going to be almost necessary for the AIs to be free and feel good?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOamtSVUxia0wya0YxeW85NFE4VTFmM0tkRDBWdDdZb184MDF1QjBxRHZqT0JIU3NUc1pKaXh4SzVfckJ3b2tNX3dWUlFscGVNVVc5RGtFa25uOXIwdjFGZk1CWkFKS3BLZ0dfeHBfUzJOOVRiejZILW5tdmc1WUt2XzFQdGRLckQ3Nmc</guid></item><item><title>结合焊接和制动清洁剂的致命危险- Hackaday</title><link>https://hackaday.com/2025/12/17/the-lethal-danger-of-combining-welding-and-brake-cleaner/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the availability of increasingly cheaper equipment, welding has become far more accessible these days. While this is definitely a plus, it also comes with the elephant-sized asterisk that as with any tool you absolutely must take into account basic safety precautions for yourself and others. This extends to the way you prepare metal for welding, with [Dr. Bernard], AKA [ChubbyEmu] recently joining forces with [styropyro] to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp6JyEdfjAQ" target="_blank"&gt;highlight the risks&lt;/a&gt; of cleaning metal with brake cleaner prior to welding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much like with common household chemicals used for cleaning, such as bleach and ammonia, improper use of these can produce e.g. chlorine gas, which while harmful is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_gas_poisoning" target="_blank"&gt;generally not lethal&lt;/a&gt;. Things get much more serious with brake cleaner, containing tetrachloroethylene. As explained in the video, getting brake cleaner on a rusty part to clean it and then exposing it to the intensive energies of the welding process suffices to create &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosgene" target="_blank"&gt;phosgene&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used as a devastating chemical weapon during World War I, phosgene does not dissolve or otherwise noticeably reduce in potency after it enters the lungs. Instead it clings to surfaces where it attacks and destroys proteins and DNA until the affected person typically dies from disruption of the lung’s blood-air barrier and subsequent pulmonary edema. Effectively your lungs fill with liquid, your blood oxygen saturation drops and at some point your body calls it quits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video is based on a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/16098259_Phosgene_inhalation_A_case_report" target="_blank"&gt;real case study&lt;/a&gt;, where in 1982 a previously healthy 23-year old man accidentally inhaled phosgene, was admitted to the ER before being rushed to the ICU. Over the course of six days he deteriorated, developed a fever and passed away after his heart stopped pumping properly due to ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, if you are off minding your own business and suddenly smell something like musty hay or freshly cut grass when nobody is mowing the lawn, there’s a chance you just inhaled phosgene. Unlike in the video, where the victim keeps welding and waits a long time before going to the ER, immediate treatment can at least give you a shot at recovery if the exposure was mild enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/08/02/getting-a-laser-eye-injury-and-how-to-avoid-it/"&gt;As with laser safety&lt;/a&gt;, prevention &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/09/19/fire-extinguishers-optical-density-ratings-and-safely-using-home-lasers/"&gt;is the best way to stay healthy&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of welding it’s essential to fully cover up your skin as there is intense UV radiation from the work area, protect your eyes with a quality welding mask and ideally wear a respirator especially when welding indoors. Show your eyes, lungs and skin how much you love them by taking good care of them — and &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; don’t use brake cleaner to prep parts for welding.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Few old ladies would turn down a nice cuppa. But over the years, daily decisions between tea or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="185603" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; could make a big difference to women's bone health, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-to-strengthen-bone-could-reverse-osteoporosis"&gt;Osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt; is a common concern for women over 50 years of age: one in three will be diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/osteoporosis/osteoporosis"&gt;the disease&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the body fails to replace old bone as it is broken down. This leads &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/osteoporosis-is-a-silent-killer-heres-how-to-avoid-it"&gt;bones to become brittle and weak&lt;/a&gt;, which makes them more prone to fractures while also making it harder to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older women are at particular risk of osteoporosis as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-new-hormone-that-makes-super-strong-bones"&gt;levels of estrogen&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2014.12.010"&gt;supports bone metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, drop after menopause. Surgeries to remove a person's ovaries have a similar effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-and-tea-each-day-could-be-protecting-your-heart"&gt;Drinking Coffee And Tea Each Day Could Be Protecting Your Heart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers from Flinders University in Australia analyzed the tea and coffee drinking habits of roughly 9,700 US women aged over 65 years, as part of a &lt;a href="https://sofonline.ucsf.edu/Home/About"&gt;broader osteoporosis study&lt;/a&gt;. Participants self-reported their tendencies in surveys conducted on four occasions in a roughly 10-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also collected data on the women's bone health, measuring bone mineral density (BMD) in the hip and the narrow part of the of the femur's connection to the hip, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-energy_X-ray_absorptiometry"&gt;using a pair of X-ray beams&lt;/a&gt; to deduce the bone's mineral content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who regularly drank tea tended to have slightly but significantly higher hip BMD than those who didn't. This may be because compounds in tea called catechins could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jf901545u"&gt;offer a boost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fasebj.2020.34.s1.09365"&gt;to the cells&lt;/a&gt; responsible for building our bones. Tea consumption also seemed to have a particularly beneficial effect in women with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee habits, on the other hand, had mixed results. Women who drank more than five cups of coffee per day were more likely to have a lower BMD, supporting studies that suggest &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00198-021-05972-w"&gt;caffeine has a negative impact&lt;/a&gt; on calcium absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking any amount of coffee was also associated with reduced femur BMD in women who drank higher amounts of alcohol in their lifetimes, suggesting each drugs' effect on bone health may be enhanced when paired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the women in the study were mostly white, which means the results may not apply to broader populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our results don't mean you need to give up coffee or start drinking tea by the gallon," &lt;a href="https://news.flinders.edu.au/blog/2025/12/11/tea-linked-to-stronger-bones-in-older-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Flinders epidemiologist Enwu Liu. "But they do suggest that moderate tea consumption could be one simple way to support bone health, and that very high coffee intake might not be ideal, especially for women who drink alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While calcium and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="185603" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; D remain cornerstones of bone health, what's in your cup could play a role too. For older women, enjoying a daily cup of tea may be more than a comforting ritual, it could be a small step toward stronger bones," he &lt;a href="https://news.flinders.edu.au/blog/2025/12/11/tea-linked-to-stronger-bones-in-older-women/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17233660"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Too much merry-making with rich foods and alcohol can strain the heart. So can stress over the holidays.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The risk of having a heart attack or stroke rises during the holiday season, with a&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.0000151424.02045.F7" target="_blank"&gt; spike in cardiac deaths&lt;/a&gt; between Christmas and New Year's. "We definitely see it in the ER over the holidays," says &lt;a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/medicine/profile/donald-lloyd-jones/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist who leads the &lt;a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Framingham Heart Study &lt;/a&gt;at Boston University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So what's causing the Christmas Coronary effect and how can you reduce your risk?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lloyd-Jones &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/07/nx-s1-5532108/the-silent-killer-increases-your-risk-of-stroke-and-dementia-heres-how-to-control-it" target="_blank"&gt;says risk factors &lt;/a&gt;that put people in danger are present year-round, but the holidays can serve as a tipping point when multiple factors converge.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Certainly the weather is a contributor, and also things like the infections that get us during the winter time, changes in our lifestyle, disruptions in our routines, and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5082364/anxiety-stress-positive-coping-class-skills" target="_blank"&gt;also the stress &lt;/a&gt;of the holiday season," Lloyd-Jones says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Too much merry-making with rich foods and alcohol can strain the heart. And &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770596/" target="_blank"&gt;numerous studies show &lt;/a&gt;excess sodium increases blood pressure, forcing the heart to work harder.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And though stress is ever-present, an acute stressor that activates the fight-or-flight response, brought on by an argument or difficult situation, could exacerbate the situation, creating a perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When we're under acute stress, things like our blood pressure can spike and that puts extra strain on the cardiovascular system," Lloyd-Jones says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some people mistake heart attack symptoms for indigestion or overeating. Here are the classic warning signs:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Sudden onset, usually of heavy pressure in the middle of the chest or sudden unexpected shortness of breath," explains Lloyd-Jones. "Those are really two cardinal symptoms that people should never ignore."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the signs are more subtle. "It's important to remember that not everyone has textbook symptoms, especially in women," says &lt;a href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/washington/clinicians/tina-shah-4743741" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Tina Shah&lt;/a&gt;, a cardiologist based in Seattle with Kaiser Permanente. She points to feeling lightheaded or experiencing pain in the jaw, neck, or back, which may be radiating from the chest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows the risk of stroke also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30973048/" target="_blank"&gt;rises this time of year&lt;/a&gt;, and strokes present differently than heart attacks. To spot signs, there's a mnemonic device known as FAST.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"If you notice facial drooping, which is the F, or if you have arm or leg weakness on one side or sudden speech difficulty, then it's time to call 911" fast, says Lloyd-Jones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Amid holiday travel and gatherings,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/09/1198047149/blue-zones-health-centenarians-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt; healthy habits may &lt;/a&gt;fall by the wayside. With disrupted routines, people may &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/11/06/1134094540/statins-vs-supplements-new-study-finds-one-is-vastly-superior-to-cut-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;forget medications&lt;/a&gt;, such as heart and blood-pressure drugs, says &lt;a href="https://providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/luke-laffin/4268377" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Luke Laffin&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's important to make sure that you have enough medicines for your entire trip," Laffin says, and if you're flying, pack them in your carry-on so you're not stranded without them if checked luggage goes missing.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;As a physician, Laffin has witnessed the rise in admission to the ER during the holidays. He stresses the importance of not delaying or avoiding care. Some people talk themselves out of going to the ER, thinking symptoms will pass, which could be a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"No one's ever going to fault you for going to the emergency department if your symptoms are concerning enough," Laffin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often, when people suspect a heart attack, that's exactly what it is. And seeking prompt treatment is key.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If someone comes to the hospital with an ongoing heart attack, the more quickly we restore blood flow with a stent, it can make the difference between someone living essentially a normal life versus living their life with heart failure," Laffin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bottom line: It's better to be safe than sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;When a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; hit West Texas earlier this year, school absences surged to levels far beyond the number of children who likely became sick, according to a study, as students were excluded or kept home by their families to minimize the spread of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absences in Seminole Independent School District, a school system that served students &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-day-care-lubbock-3d90c3ea9050c12dbc74a8f8142a6355"&gt;at the heart of the outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, climbed 41% across all grade levels compared with the same period the two previous years, according to the Stanford University study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preliminary &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://edworkingpapers.com/ai25-1358" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which has not been published or finished a formal peer review, offers a glimpse at the toll on student learning from the spread of measles, a highly contagious disease that has crept up in communities around the U.S. with low vaccination rates. In Texas and nationally, about two-thirds of measles cases have been among unvaccinated children. When measles is spreading, public health officials respond by excluding unvaccinated students from schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“The costs of that &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/school-attendance-sick-day-chronic-absenteeism-270f6d07041760e90bf84d9f4108aa4d"&gt;absenteeism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are just not among the sick kids, but all the kids who are kept out of school as a precaution,” said Thomas Dee, a Stanford economist and education professor who co-authored the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles is airborne and poses severe risk for young children. In 2000, the illness was declared eradicated in the U.S., thanks to the widespread usage of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. In recent years, more parents have sought &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccination-rates-cdc-kindergarten-0d261546a130dc256735d7b1ff8c6a5f"&gt;exemptions to school requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for the shots, and most states are &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;below the 95% kindergarten vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;In Seminole Independent School District, only &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;77% of kindergartners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; were vaccinated against measles in the 2024-2025 school year, according to state health department data. The measles upsurge there launched &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-us-texas-mmr-vaccine-rfk-144ed193e13de675a750e52a505423e9"&gt;the United States’ worst measles year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in more than three decades, sickening 762 people across Texas in seven months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That number could have been even higher. The &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/Admin-Meales/doc/2025-measles-data-report-nov-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Texas Department of State Health Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says there were an additional 182 potential measles cases reported in March 2025 among children in surrounding Gaines County that the state excluded from its count due to lack of information.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;h2&gt;Absenteeism extended far beyond confirmed measles cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using state data, the study estimated 141 Seminole district students had confirmed measles cases. It found the increase in school absences was approximately 10 times what would be expected from just those students missing class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials recommend that people sick with measles or suspected measles isolate at home until four days after they get the telltale rash. State guidance calls for unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable students to be excluded from school for up to 21 days after exposure to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children from preschool to first grade had the most pronounced spike in absences — a 71% increase from the last two school years, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most student absences amid the outbreak were due to local health requirements for children to stay out of school if they may have been exposed to somebody diagnosed with measles, Seminole Superintendent Glen Teal said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the students who were directed to stay home, it’s unclear how many families may have kept children out of school on their own as a precaution. But there’s a good argument that parental concern played a role, said Jacob Kirksey, a Texas Tech University education policy professor who was not involved in the study but reviewed it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re hearing on the news or you’re seeing that there is just an illness outbreak more broadly, the parents are going to be predispositioned to just be more hesitant to send their kids to school,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other states with outbreaks see many kids miss school&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks in other states, such as &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-south-carolina-utah-arizona-3bfc561ecc16d8e80175effdae0791d4"&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, also have produced spikes in school absenteeism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 165 people — including 127 students from three schools — were in a 21-day quarantine as of Tuesday because they were unvaccinated or otherwise vulnerable to getting sick. Some children have been quarantined twice due to new cases, said Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist for the South Carolina Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination continues to be the best way to prevent the disruption that measles is causing to people’s education, to employment and other factors of people’s lives in our communities,” Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing out on learning time can have long-term implications for a child’s success. Schools have been dealing with &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-children/index.html"&gt;learning loss from the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which contributed also to elevated rates of &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/missing-students-chronic-absenteeism/index.html"&gt;chronic absenteeism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More frequent absenteeism also puts a strain on teachers’ ability to educate their students. Most educators aren’t trained on how to handle instructional pacing when a large chunk of their students are absent, Kirksey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

This year, a new strain of influenza, known as influenza A H3N2 or the subclade K variant, according to &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/aggressive-flu-variant-sweeps-globe-211109238.html" data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:Fox News;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;, is spreading rapidly across the globe and in the United States. This week, the &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-49.html" data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; reported an 8.1% uptick in positive flu tests nationwide, with the new strain leading to &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flu-rising-around-us-experts-184607556.html" data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:a rise in cases and hospitalizations;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;a rise in cases and hospitalizations&lt;/a&gt;, particularly from the inland western states to the Northeast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Experts previously predicted that &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/experts-predict-years-flu-season-120000811.html" data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:this flu season would be more severe;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;this flu season would be more severe&lt;/a&gt; than some previous ones, due to genetic changes to the virus that made it easier to infect people. And with the Southern Hemisphere seeing a rise in the flu subvariant this summer (which is the Southern Hemisphere’s winter, when the flu tends to circulate) experts believed that the same could happen here once our chillier months arrived. Australia, for example, &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://au.news.yahoo.com/wake-call-australia-worst-flu-230428419.html" data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:broke its national record for;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;broke its national record for&lt;/a&gt; flu cases this year, amid vaccine hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Still, there are things you can do to protect yourself. Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the symptoms of the flu? How is it treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a range of not-so-fun symptoms of the flu, including fever, muscle ache, cough, headache and exhaustion, per &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719" data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Some people also experience GI issues, like vomiting and diarrhea, or ear pain. The only way to know for certain that you have the flu is to take a test, after which your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication that can shorten the duration of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One clue that you may have the flu is &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/flu-season-officially-doctors-telling-121602089.html" data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:how quickly the symptoms;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;how quickly the symptoms &lt;/a&gt;manifest. While the common cold may develop gradually, with a scratchy throat for a day or two before you really feel unwell, the flu can be quite sudden, causing you to feel fine one moment and awful the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can treat the flu at home with rest, liquids to avoid dehydration that can worsen symptoms and over-the-counter fever reducers and pain medication like ibuprofen. However, if you are experiencing severe symptoms like chest pain, confusion, severe dizziness, shortness of breath or dehydration, seek medical attention immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is a flu shot effective in preventing the new strain of the flu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the flu vaccine still protects against severe outcomes from the illness, the current version of the shot is not up to date with the latest strain, as the vaccine was formulated before the  current strain started circulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, getting vaccinated for the flu is still your best chance at &lt;a rel class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/flu-shot-040001043.html" data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" data-ylk="slk:preventing severe disease;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;preventing severe disease&lt;/a&gt;. It can also stop you from catching other forms of the flu that it’s a better match for, as different variants still circulate, albeit to a lesser degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else can I do to stay healthy? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are simple measures you can take to prevent the flu.

    &lt;p&gt;Colorado health officials have confirmed the state's first influenza-associated pediatric death of the 2025-2026 season. The child, who was elementary school-aged and lived in the Denver metro area, died last week, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes as flu activity surges statewide. CDPHE reports a 43% increase in flu-related hospitalizations during the last week of November, and pediatricians say they are seeing far more cases than usual this early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;"At the moment, there's about 10 times as much flu as anything else," said Dr. Gregg Kennedy, a pediatrician at Denver Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy added that most children recover at home, but some require hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Annually throughout the whole country, we usually see several hundred pediatric deaths from the flu, and over 90% of them are kids that don't have the flu vaccine," he said. "If I had to give one recommendation to make sure our kids aren't going to die from the flu, the vaccine is going to be a really good idea for that." &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools are feeling the impact as well. At Colorado Kids Academy in Lakewood, owner Mara Hackett said the preschool had to close for a day when so many children became ill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Children were coming in without any symptoms, and hours later they're developing really high fevers," Hackett said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said about 70% of students were out sick, and staff have returned to COVID-era cleaning protocols to keep families safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our number one thing is keeping kids safe and healthy," Hackett said. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to curb the spread, CDPHE will begin sending text messages and emails this week to families of more than 225,000 children ages 6 months to 5 years whose records show they may be overdue for a flu shot. Doctors recommend getting vaccinated as soon as possible, keeping sick children home, and practicing good hygiene. Flu season typically peaks in January and February, but health officials warn this year's early surge could mean a longer, more severe season.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. appointed this year after he fired the previous ones — &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/cdc-panel-vote-hepatitis-b-vaccine-babies-rfk-jr-rcna247482" target="_blank"&gt;voted for the recommendation this month&lt;/a&gt;, upending more than three decades of agency guidance. Acting CDC Director Jim O’Neill accepted the change Tuesday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— the final step for it to become the agency’s policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-887c24" class="body-graf"&gt;“We are restoring the balance of informed consent to parents whose newborns face little risk of contracting hepatitis B,” O'Neill said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-009d50" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC had &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5730a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommended the birth dose of the vaccine&lt;/a&gt; since 1991. Many public health experts criticized the advisory committee’s decision: After the meeting, a chorus of doctors, political leaders and health officials called on O’Neill to ignore the suggested change and maintain the CDC’s recommendation, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a5ffb4" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC now suggests waiting until at least 2 months of age for babies’ first hepatitis B shots if they do not receive the birth dose. However, it still recommends that babies born to mothers who test positive for hepatitis B or whose infection statuses are unknown get hepatitis B vaccines within the first day of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54f6e3" class="body-graf"&gt;The agency is still reviewing a secondary recommendation from the panel: that parents consult with health care providers about the possibility of testing children for antibodies to hepatitis B before they decide whether to get second doses of the vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is typically given to babies as a three-dose series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-099f08" class="body-graf"&gt;The new policy is one of the most notable examples of the way CDC guidance is diverging from widespread medical consensus. The advisory committee's discussion of hepatitis B vaccines was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-advisory-panel-delays-vote-hepatitis-b-vaccines-rcna247362" target="_blank"&gt;rife with misinformation and cherry-picked data&lt;/a&gt;, and it ignored decades of evidence that hepatitis B vaccines are safe and effective when they are given shortly after birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-59171c"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture" data-flavor="fit" data-original-height="1467" data-original-width="2200"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-cdc-vaccine-panel-lr-861d99.jpg" alt="CDC Panel Reverses Call To Give All Newborns Hepatitis B Shot"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Dec. 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Megan Varner / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4fff80" class="body-graf"&gt;Many public health experts say delaying the hepatitis B vaccine until babies are older could lead to a resurgence of infections and possibly more deaths from liver disease or cancer. Pediatric cases of acute hepatitis B plummeted after the CDC began recommending a universal birth dose, falling by &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00333549231175548" target="_blank"&gt;99% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Hepatitis B can be passed from mother to child during delivery, and not all pregnant women get tested for it. There is no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a33a35" class="body-graf"&gt;“Ending the recommendation for newborns makes it more likely the number of cases will begin to increase again. This makes America sicker,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1996974038413971766" target="_blank"&gt;said on X this month&lt;/a&gt;. Cassidy is one of many medical professionals who publicly asked O’Neill not to adopt the advisory panel’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d14eab" class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians are expected to keep recommending that parents vaccinate their newborns for hepatitis B. The Department of Health and Human Services has said the new recommendations will not affect insurance coverage of the shots. The vaccine will also continue to be offered to newborns through the Vaccines for Children Program, which provides free shots for uninsured or underinsured kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4667b" class="body-graf"&gt;The hepatitis B decision was the latest in a series of CDC policy changes that have not been backed by science, leading some public health experts to suggest that the agency’s guidance should no longer be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-596283" class="body-graf"&gt;After Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-guts-acip-cdc-vaccine-panel-rcna211935" target="_blank"&gt;gutted the long-standing membership&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s vaccine panel — formally known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — in June, he replaced it with a group that has largely expressed skepticism of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-793710" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Neill, a former investment executive who does not have a medical background, previously worked at the Department of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. He became acting CDC director in August after Kennedy abruptly fired the previous director, Susan Monarez. Kennedy said Monarez was fired for being untrustworthy, but Monarez said Kennedy dismissed her for refusing to blindly approve the vaccine advisory panel’s recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7e16f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Last month, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-autism-vaccines-webpage-studies-changes-language-rcna244936" target="_blank"&gt;altered a webpage&lt;/a&gt; that had once unequivocally said vaccines do not cause autism, claiming instead that studies have not ruled out a link. (In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinesafety.edu/do-vaccines-cause-autism/" target="_blank"&gt;decades of research&lt;/a&gt; have found no association.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66c028" class="body-graf"&gt;In October, O’Neill &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/separate-measles-mumps-rubella-vaccine-acting-cdc-director-rcna235971" target="_blank"&gt;called on vaccine manufacturers&lt;/a&gt; to develop separate shots for measles, mumps and rubella, without evidence to support breaking up the combined vaccine. And in September, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/medicine-and-pregnancy/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;updated its guidance&lt;/a&gt; to tell pregnant women to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/trump-acetaminophen-fda-pregnancy-autism-cause-rcna232909" target="_blank"&gt;consider avoiding acetaminophen&lt;/a&gt; — the active ingredient in Tylenol — because of a possible connection to autism in children. (The bulk of scientific literature to date &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/acetaminophen-tylenol-pregnancy-autism-risk-rfk-jr-rcna229429" target="_blank"&gt;has not found a definitive link&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db19ec" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;After decades of leaning on CDC guidance, many states have begun to defer to recommendations from &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/us-vaccine-split-realities-rcna228932" target="_blank"&gt;newly formed public health alliances&lt;/a&gt; or professional medical societies like the American Academy of Pediatrics. The AAP continues to recommend a first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, followed by additional doses at 1 to 2 months and 6 to 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 23:34:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNS1RhTjFtRGFoNXQwek9Wb21mVWZQa0tpMW9rZEJrMFExSTRqM1ptSUs1MTNpaG94TU8xQTJBa25BWi10aTN3ZWgzMUdXZmhfeEo0M1h2TzVZT2xzNkJnN0JCamI2b3FEQmVrUG9XMkhRVGVDTVI1ZlY3YzlsU1NEYVY5WTIxWVdSNmluMnl0TVhkNXAwcE9UTTlqSTVueWJzVjY3NmhFMkZfQdIBVkFVX3lxTFBTbm91VVhUY2gxd05WbjVvcENlQWJ6XzZ0ZVJQWEVEc3ctYkxWM0hPT245ZGJhY3ZSN0tPTlFNYkFHaFI4dVdEcjk1NEZNdXQ2RUJYSUFB</guid></item><item><title>南卡罗来纳州、亚利桑那州和犹他州的麻疹疫情恶化- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-worsen-south-carolina-arizona-utah/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Measles outbreaks &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;are growing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; along the Utah-Arizona border and in South Carolina, where hundreds are in quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between Friday and Tuesday, South Carolina health officials confirmed 27 new measles cases in an outbreak in and around northwestern Spartanburg County. In two months, 111 people have been sickened by the vaccine-preventable virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 250 people, including students from nine area elementary, middle and high schools, are in quarantine — some for the second time since the outbreak began in October. Most of the state's new cases stemmed from exposures at Way of Truth Church in Inman. Church leaders have been "very helpful," said state epidemiologist Dr. Linda Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are faced with ongoing transmission that we anticipate will go on for many more weeks, at least in our state," Bell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Arizona and Utah, an outbreak has ballooned since August. Mohave County, Arizona, has logged 172 cases and the Southwest Utah Public Health Department has logged 82 cases. The border cities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah, are the heaviest hit. Overall, Utah has confirmed 115 measles cases this year. Arizona has confirmed 176.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    &lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationally, the measles case count is nearing 2,000 for a disease that has been considered eliminated in the U.S. since 2000. Cases have mostly spread among people who were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Canada lost that designation — which applies when there is no continuous local spread of the virus — as did the larger health region of the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the U.S. is also at risk of losing that status. For that to happen, measles would have to spread continuously for a year. A large outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico and Oklahoma that started in January sickened nearly 900 and kicked off the United States' worst measles year &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-us-cases-record-high-since-1992/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;in more than three decades&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All but eight states have logged at least one measles case this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has confirmed 47 outbreaks this year, compared with 16 in 2024. Three people — two of them Texas school children — have died.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt Medical Center who has served as a liaison to the ACIP, told CBS News in an interview Tuesday that the "simple answer" behind the spread of the outbreaks is that "parents are withholding their children from vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know, vaccination is so very effective that ... by comprehensively vaccinating all of our children, eliminated measles from the United States," Schaffner said, later adding that "we are turning the clock back." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined MMR vaccine is safe and provides 97% protection against the disease after two doses, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. Most children in the U.S. are required to get the MMR shot to attend school. But vaccination rates have declined as more parents waive the shots or have fallen behind on recommended vaccination schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee-rfk-jr-vote-measles-hepatitis-b/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;the CDC's vaccine recommendation committee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; voted to recommend that the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine, or MMRV, be separated into MMR and varicella shots for children under the age of 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices made the change after &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-advisory-panel-names/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;undergoing a complete overhaul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-cdc-acip-members-covid-vaccine-critics/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Several of those new members&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; have a history of being vaccine skeptics.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to CBS News medical contributor Dr. Céline Gounder, while the combined MMRV vaccine offers the convenience of one shot instead of two, it does carry a slightly higher risk of fever-related "febrile" seizures when used as the first dose in young toddlers aged 12-23 months. The side effect is most common between the ages of 14-18 months. &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cdc-vaccine-panel-meeting-science-politics-vaccination/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Gounder says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that while febrile seizures are rare and almost always resolve without lasting effects, they are frightening for families and can erode trust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show there is no elevated risk when MMRV is given for the second dose at ages 4 to 6 years old, after children have outgrown the highest-risk window, Gounder says. &lt;/p&gt;

These drugs are known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1"&gt;glucagon-like peptide-1&lt;/a&gt; (GLP-1) receptor agonists, because of the way they mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-reshapes-the-kinds-of-food-people-eat-heres-what-happens"&gt;controls appetite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using health records, the team matched people who had taken one of the weight loss drugs with people who had undergone either of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bariatric_surgery"&gt;bariatric surgery&lt;/a&gt; operations, based on age, body mass index, and blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-diabetes-pill-works-as-well-as-ozempic-for-weight-loss-trial-finds"&gt;New Diabetes Pill Works as Well as Ozempic For Weight Loss, Trial Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line: people in the surgery group shed an average of 25.7 percent of their total body weight over two years, while those in the medication group lost 5.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's partly down to patients not sticking to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-vs-supplements-dietitian-reveals-truth-about-glp-1-imitations"&gt;their GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt;, whereas surgery is more permanent, but the researchers also noticed smaller differences over shorter time frames – the surgery always gave the best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_165321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg" alt="Ozempic Isn't Actually The Most Effective Option For Weight Loss, Scientists Confirm" class="wp-image-165321 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/06/ozempic-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-165321" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Semaglutide mimics the body's natural GLP-1 hormone.

GLP-1 patients may need to adjust their expectations, adhere more closely to treatment or opt for metabolic and bariatric surgery to achieve desired results."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that the study was funded by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS), which would have a vested interest in promoting surgical options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aren't outright dismissing semaglutide treatments, which also showed beneficial results in this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-coverage-of-and-spending-on-glp-1s/"&gt;GLP-1 prescriptions doubling&lt;/a&gt; from 2022 to 2023, it's crucial to investigate how they compare to established &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/as-well-as-weight-loss-studies-find-bariatric-surgery-also-lowers-the-risk-of-developing-cancer"&gt;surgery methods&lt;/a&gt;, and to figure out which options are best for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While both patient groups lose weight, metabolic and bariatric surgery is much more effective and durable," &lt;a href="https://asmbs.org/news_releases/head-to-head-study-shows-bariatric-surgery-superior-to-glp-1-drugs-for-weight-loss/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; ASMBS President Ann M.

Meanwhile, only a small percentage of people eligible for surgery choose it as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But weight loss isn't the only benefit that can come from Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug was originally approved to treat type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="185685" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, because it helps lower blood sugar levels, and studies have shown it can also reduce &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-and-similar-drugs-lower-cancer-risks-study-suggests"&gt;the risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ozempic-could-be-good-for-your-heart-even-if-you-dont-lose-weight"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, bariatric surgery was associated with even better blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174931" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174931" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon.jpg" alt="A spoonful of white sugar with a raspberry on top" class="size-medium wp-image-174931" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon-578x415.jpg 578w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/RaspberryAndSugarOnSpoon-600x431.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174931" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Bariatric surgery was associated with better blood sugar control compared to semaglutide.

I thought the limp was just me not used to being on my feet, and that after I rested, it would get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It “stopped hurting after a while,” but as the mom of two — she shares Ashton, now 2, and Emma, who will turn 1 on Dec. 28, with her husband Joey — explains, “I had just had a baby a few months before and figured my body was still healing from all of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the Nebraska mom took Ashton to his 2-year wellness visit in June, she mentioned the limp to the doctor, who “called in a favor” to get Decker an appointment with a neurologist.  A month later, Decker’s primary doctor mentioned that she was concerned it could be &lt;a href="https://people.com/sandra-bullock-bryan-randall-als-what-is-it-7570801" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyotrophic lateral sclerosis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis &lt;/a&gt;— aka, &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebrities-who-have-been-diagnosed-with-als-11713728" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ALS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt; — commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. “I knew very little about the diagnosis other than there was no cure,” Decker tells PEOPLE. “Everything I researched online was heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannon Runge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Decker with her children Ashton and Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/john-driskell-hopkins-releases-i-love-you-forever-als-update-exclusive-11733525" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ALS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;ALS&lt;/a&gt; is a rare degenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis of the muscles. Patients first experience twitching or weakness in a limb, as Decker did. The disease affects the nerve cells in the brain and spine that control muscle movement, so patients slowly lose their ability to speak, eat, walk, and breathe independently, per to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mayo Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. There's no cure for ALS, and people usually live three to five years after diagnosis, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mda.org/disease/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Muscular Dystrophy Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Muscular Dystrophy Association&lt;/a&gt;. However, some patients can live decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Joey, 35, recalls the moment his wife told him what doctors suspected. "My wife walked in ... out of nowhere, crying a deep, broken cry. I didn't know what was going on, but when I saw her, I dropped my [building] tools, stood up, and just held her tight for a few minutes while she found the space between deep breaths to fit the words into. Once she told me what the doctor thought was going on [ALS]), my heart immediately fell through the floor. Everything we've spent our entire lives working toward crashed beneath us in that moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decker says they “cried for hours that first day. We then kept praying that it was something, anything, else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More tests led to Decker being officially diagnosed with ALS on Sept. 2. “Hearing the official diagnosis was just as heartbreaking,” Decker tells PEOPLE. “There are days when life feels normal and I forget for just a few minutes that there is something wrong, and then it will hit me again. We've really had to accept our emotions in our house because at any given moment me or my husband might be crying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family has started a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/donate-to-megans-als-journey-and-family-needs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:GoFundMe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help them pay for the mounting medical bills — and for a necessary move to a home without stairs. As the fundraiser explains, “They're currently renting a single-story home from a friend of theirs but it isn't handicap accessible, and they're getting to a point where that's a functional necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Young&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Decker with husband Joey, and children Ashton and Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decker is already struggling to walk. “I am currently using a walker to get around short distances, and if I'm going longer distances, we have an electric wheelchair.” The wheelchair has allowed her to still be present with her family at events like “the pumpkin patch and parades.” As the disease progresses, they plan to rely on adaptive equipment, like “&lt;a href="https://people.com/celebrity/als-patients-communicate-in-their-voices-after-they-lose-ability-to-speak/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:voicebanking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;voicebanking&lt;/a&gt;,” which will allow her to “still be able to communicate with my family and it will be in my ‘voice’ even if it gets to the point that I can no longer speak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the meantime, the young couple is trying to help their children cope. “Both of our kids are too young to understand what is going on," Decker says, explaining they tell their toddler “in ways he will understand: ‘Mommy is just sad right now, and that's okay’ or ‘Mommy's legs are feeling weak today so Daddy gets to carry you.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But as Decker shares, her disease is progressing quickly, and “the diagnosis and treatment coming from the doctors is very bleak.” She’s been told, “I will likely not be walking within a year and would guess my life expectancy is three.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannon Runge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Megan Decker with husband Joey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“My husband and I are supposed to be starting our lives together, not trying to figure out how to help me be more comfortable in the next three years as I slowly lose all function of my body, while my mind is still there. It's not something anyone should have to face. I'm just so thankful for our amazing support system throughout all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decker explains that she's trying to keep positive as much as possible. "I think the hopelessness can contribute to a faster decline, and I want as much time with my kids as possible so I'm focusing on the good. I also don't want them to remember me as bitter or angry, so I'm going to focus on the good and be grateful. There are days this is hard, but that is my goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The family will be setting up a donated playground in their yard, she says, so “I can go watch them from our porch and just be involved that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And Joey shares, "I'm still a broken man, and I've accepted that I probably always will be, but Ashton and Emma deserve the best life possible, and our time with mommy may be limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We just want to make as many memories as possible with our children while mommy is still here," he says, "so we can fill our home with reminders that she loves these amazing kids more than they could ever know, while fighting our hardest to keep her around to remind them herself.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/young-mom-of-2-fatigue-heartbreaking-als-exclusive-11868969" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 22:04:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1JQmZwU3R1M3FsVzVQakpuMmxacUYxY3hNUnl3TDdHOE5YeWxpeUxqVVdKVTlvMnhfdGlUODQ5Wk1Jem9lcF9YOWpmU3A3dkFVa2pKVm9yTzBXY1diQVgzRzR6RjBjNThYLVJ3ekFxU2V6MmdWZUE</guid></item><item><title>社交隔离直接加速认知衰退-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/social-isolation-cognitive-decline-30058/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Social isolation has a direct causal impact on how quickly cognitive function declines in later life, independent of whether someone feels lonely. By analyzing more than 137,000 cognitive tests from over 30,000 older adults, the study found that reduced social contact consistently predicted faster decline across every demographic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and isolation each influence health, but only isolation reliably caused cognitive deterioration. With rates of Alzheimer’s already high and no cure available, the findings highlight that strengthening social connection is not only emotionally beneficial but neurologically protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation as a Cause:&lt;/strong&gt; Objective social isolation—not just loneliness—directly accelerates cognitive decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistent Across Groups:&lt;/strong&gt; The effect appeared across gender, race, ethnicity, and education levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large-Scale Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings were based on over 137,000 cognitive assessments collected over 14 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of St. Andrews&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research from the University of St Andrews has discovered a direct causal effect between social isolation and a faster decline in later- life cognitive function.

Prior to Covid 19, about a quarter of older individuals (65 and over) identified as being socially isolated, spurring concerns about health implications.

One of those possible negative health impacts is Alzheimer’s disease, a leading cause of death for adults in the United States and many high-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a life course perspective, we explore whether there is a direct causal effect of social isolation on later-life trajectories of cognitive function, the extent to which any effect of social isolation on cognitive impairment operates indirectly through loneliness, who may be most vulnerable, and the potential efficacy of a statistical intervention for those living alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use a counterfactual approach, the g-formula, with the U.S. Health and Retirement Study, analyzing data from 30,421 individuals with 137,653 observations across 2004-2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We find a consistent pattern of social isolation having a detrimental direct causal effect on cognitive function, with only 6% of this effect operating through loneliness. Reducing social isolation has a protective effect on cognitive function for all subpopulations regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, and educational level, with only minor differences among social categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our statistical intervention shows that targeting social isolation in those living alone may be one viable public health strategy for protecting against cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that addressing social isolation—and, by extension, its effects on health—requires both a broad understanding of its heterogenous impacts on the general population and a nuanced approach to targeting public health interventions where they can be most effective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2025 21:59:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE51bU0wel84QTM0dXJLbXdmb01ldnpHSjlrTERERkx1bGpUT2ppQWZmM1NranpqNUVvbFR4dEVTODVZWkZjNC1SdlNfRGRNTHNWOC1lSmxOOEpCay1Gc01tVFgtTk5FSmliakw1aEt4cXF2QVhjOW9lZmdn0gF_QVVfeXFMUFBaVTJiSXlXcEhQUlM2TURHbmt2eThja2pJd19xSGo5TDAtbzh2T2tSVWN6V0FDUTdrVDhTSUR4eUtVc3p0eFVid01sOTBpWnp3di1qRWItSmQ1T1lENGpvNU91SXQ5OWdYYlJhWWEyYlNGSjJCR2JzbTRzY19yWQ</guid></item><item><title>第二所梅德福学校在胃病突发后取消课程- WCVB</title><link>https://www.wcvb.com/article/st-joseph-school-cancels-classes-stomach-illness-medford/69779812</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-content--body-text-raw"&gt;
						A second school in Medford, Massachusetts, was forced to cancel classes this week after an outbreak of stomach illness. St. Joseph School reported that 20% of its students were absent Monday, prompting the school to cancel Tuesday and Wednesday classes "out of an abundance of caution," according to Boston Archdiocese spokesman Terrence Donilon.  The school said there are no medical records confirming norovirus, but a "significant number of students (were sent home) with stomach bug symptoms," the school said in a letter to families. The school will use the break from classes to "deep clean and sanitize the school," and help stop the spread of illness before the holidays.Classes are expected to resume Thursday."If you or a family member is feeling sick on Wednesday morning, DO NOT send your child(ren) to school," the school wrote. This is the second school in the city to cancel classes for illness in as many weeks. Roberts School canceled classes last Thursday and Friday after more than 130 students and staff members were absent from class, reporting upset stomach symptoms. Norovirus is a contagious illness with which the affected usually experience sudden symptoms like vomiting. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting, diarrhea and foodborne illness in the country.

It’s an eating disorder that’s characterized as an obsession with only consuming “healthy” foods—and it’s on the rise, says Sadi Fox, PhD, a licensed psychotherapist who specializes in eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have that friend who talks a little too much about things like “clean eating,” or that random food group they’re entirely avoiding in pursuit of better health. Think: carbs, sugar, gluten (provided they don’t have an allergy). The problem? Orthorexia can result in nutritional deficiencies, mental health challenges, and social isolation. It can also be a “slippery slope” for other disordered behaviors, Fox says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the signs of orthorexia can be very difficult to identify. Since eating healthy is generally perceived as a good thing, people with orthorexia might be praised for their disorder, not know they have a problem, and not end up getting the help they need—which is the case for some patients who work with Fox. “A lot of people are just like, ‘Whoa, I didn't even realize how deep [into my eating disorder] I was,’” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to this sneaky mental health condition, signs and symptoms may be hard to spot. Here’s what experts want you to know about orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://flourishpsychologynyc.com/flourish-therapists/#sadi" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sadi Fox;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sadi Fox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, is a psychotherapist specializing in eating disorders at &lt;a href="https://flourishpsychologynyc.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Psychology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Psychology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Brooklyn-based private psychotherapy practice. &lt;a href="https://www.weflourishpsychology.com/dr-kelli-rugless-psyd" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kelli Rugless;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kelli Rugless&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, PsyD, is a clinical psychologist and eating disorder specialist at the virtual talk therapy practice &lt;a href="https://www.weflourishpsychology.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flourish Psychology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flourish Psychology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.emilyvaneck.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emily Van Eck;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emily Van Eck&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RD, is a dietitian and intuitive eating counselor at &lt;a href="https://www.emilyvaneck.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Emily Van Eck Nutrition;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Emily Van Eck Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is orthorexia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put simply, orthorexia is when eating healthy goes from a goal to an obsession, skewing what “healthy” even means in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With orthorexia, a person becomes so focused on avoiding foods they think are harmful that they end up depriving their body of the nutrition it needs, says Kelli Rugless, PsyD, a clinical psychologist and eating disorder specialist at the private therapy practice Flourish Psychology. It’s important to note that the foods people avoid aren’t always based on good, accurate information. People with orthorexia might make choices based on different approaches they see on social media, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s backed by science, says Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, if you ask a nutritionist, cutting out entire groups of foods, no matter what they are, can result in a pretty unhealthy diet. Because their diets can become so restrictive, people who are orthorexic might lack key nutrients, not get sufficient calories for normal bodily functions, and have digestive issues like constipation, says Emily Van Eck, RD, a nutritionist who works with patients with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not officially recognized in the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60722310/what-is-high-functioning-anxiety/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DSM-5;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DSM-5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the handbook for diagnosing mental disorders), but orthorexia is an eating disorder that has risen significantly over the past few years, according to the experts who treat it. Without formal diagnostic criteria, it’s challenging to determine exactly how many people in the U.S. struggle with orthorexia, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Eating Disorders Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Eating Disorders Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—but prevalence varies across countries and populations, ranging from 6.9% in the Italian population to 88.7% in Brazil, per a 2021 review in the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/10/5488" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Other studies suggest orthorexia might be more common in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram users;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Instagram users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (49% prevalence) &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457720303624" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nutrition students;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nutrition students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (72% prevalence), and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs40337-023-00739-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.womenshealthmag.com%2Fhealth%2Fa69757847%2Forthorexia-eating-disorder%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:populations that exercise;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;populations that exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (55% prevalence). Plus, athletes and endurance athletes (runners especially) have higher symptom severity when it comes to orthorexia, according to a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10710386/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the physical complications that come with orthorexia, the eating disorder is also associated with mental and emotional challenges, including dealing with shame, guilt, fear, and social isolation when it comes to food, says Rugless. “Their relationship with food becomes obsessive,” says Rugless. They might avoid social situations where they can’t control what they eat. Plus, the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-062520-122331" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stress;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that comes with an eating disorder can ruin your quality of life, says Van Eck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to eating disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anorexia and bulimia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anorexia and bulimia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a person’s primary motivation might be to change the look of their body, orthorexia typically starts with the goal to eat the healthiest foods possible, says Rugless. This goal doesn’t happen in a vacuum, though. “It’s diet culture’s newest attack,” says Fox. Media and social media’s support of things like “clean eating,” different harmful dietary practices, and general health misinformation may contribute to fears about “toxic” foods and could be supporting this uptick in orthorexia, per a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490497/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, social media is playing a role in the increase of this eating disorder, which can have serious consequences on someone’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signs And Symptoms Of Orthorexia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you tell if someone is simply eating healthy or dealing with an eating disorder? Look for rigidity, says Rugless. If a friend is dividing foods into black and white categories (like “good” and “bad”) and cutting out entire food groups aside from allergies or religious and cultural traditions, that’s a sign they could be dealing with something deeper. They also might avoid certain restaurants, bring their own food, or refuse to eat altogether if they can’t access a food they’re okay with. They may also spend a lot of time researching food or spending money on health foods they can’t afford, adds Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who struggle with orthorexia tend to focus on not eating anything “harmful,” “damaging,” or “bad,” Rugless says. Instead, they consume foods they believe are “pure,” or “clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are a bit moralistic about it,” says Fox. If you have a friend who feels particularly judgy about food—or even about what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; eat—that also might be a sign of an unhealthy relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you or a loved one might be struggling with orthorexic behaviors, it’s always a good idea to talk to a therapist. If you’re not sure, here are some questions Fox tends to ask patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your diet representative of the different food groups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does your diet make you feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does thinking about eating and food take up a lot of time in your life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does what you eat cost an appropriate amount of money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you able to enjoy social gatherings around food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is orthorexia diagnosed and treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since orthorexia is not an official diagnosis in the DSM, there isn’t a set of clear clinical criteria to determine whether a person has it or not. However, if you’re exhibiting any of the above behaviors—like consistently fixating on food that you perceive to be “harmful,” avoiding restaurants, focusing on foods that you feel are “clean,” or any of the other behaviors mentioned, it’s likely a sign that you could be dealing with orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with a licensed therapist and a dietitian can help you navigate this eating disorder, Fox and Rugless say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapists might use &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cognitive behavioral therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CBT)—a type of psychotherapy focused on disrupting unhelpful thought patterns—to help you get back to the basics, make sure all food groups are represented in your diet and work on breaking down some of the ideas you might have about what makes something “healthy.” A dietitian can help make sure you're adequately nourishing your body, all while helping you fight misinformation you might have internalized about food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To See A Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you may be struggling with orthorexia or any other eating disorder, it’s always a good idea to check in with an eating disorder specialist—they can help you, no matter how far along you are. To find one, you can look for therapists who mention specializing in eating disorders in their bios or for a Certified Eating Disorders Specialist (CEDS) or Certified Eating Disorders Registered Dietitian (CEDRD) credential.

&lt;p id="078196e6-fac2-4411-9ab7-ff9b43a9cfbe"&gt;Scientists have identified a "dial" in the human brain that ramps up when we explore a new area — and the finding could help us understand why getting lost is often an early symptom of dementia, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/dementia-facts-about-alzheimers-and-other-forms-of-dementia" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/dementia-facts-about-alzheimers-and-other-forms-of-dementia"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine you're walking a well-worn route home, but you accidentally take a wrong turn.

"You have to explore your environment to become familiar with it." Vatansever and his team aimed to re-create this experience in VR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They recruited 56 healthy volunteers ages 20 to 37, each of whom navigated a virtual world while inside a scanner. They explored the virtual environment — a grassy field surrounded by mountains — while looking for six "items" hidden throughout it. Vatansever's team monitored the volunteers' brain activity with functional MRI, a technique that tracks blood flow through the brain, as they explored familiar and unfamiliar areas of this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team zoomed in on the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/hippocampus" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/hippocampus"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hippocampus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a brain region that's important for memory and navigation. The seahorse-shaped hippocampus is rich with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://brainfacts.org/brain-anatomy-and-function/cells-and-circuits/2017/on-the-grid-033117" target="_blank" data-url="http://brainfacts.org/brain-anatomy-and-function/cells-and-circuits/2017/on-the-grid-033117" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;place cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which light up in response to specific locations. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30618-3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30618-3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Previous research had shown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that one end of the hippocampus contains cells that fire when we think about location in a broad sense, such as where landmarks are in a nearby city. At the other end, place cells activate when we think about specific locations, like where we keep a box of cereal in our kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between the "head" and "tail" of the hippocampus seahorse is a gradient of activity linking these broad and fine-tuned representations of locations. But no one had previously examined the organization of cells that respond to the newness or familiarity of a place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-iWyMFowwa6LAbFZ7wSa85f" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-iWyMFowwa6LAbFZ7wSa85f slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="d2e9e593-3b8d-48e2-aff4-cdb4612bd40e"&gt;Vatansever's team found that the head of the hippocampus contains cells that fired when their participants explored areas they had been in previously. Cells at the tail responded to new locations. And the whole region was arranged in a gradient, from familiar to unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could see that there's this shift in level of novelty versus familiarity as you go from one end to the other," Vatansever said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2014.08.005" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2014.08.005" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;produced mixed results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on which areas of the hippocampus respond to novelty or familiarity in the environment, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/35058-zita-patai" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/35058-zita-patai" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zita Patai&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London who was not involved with the research. "What they're showing is that [the discrepancy] might partially be due to the fact that it's a gradient," she told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other brain areas also responded differently to new and familiar locations. A region in the cortex — the brain's higher-thinking hub — had a cone-shaped gradient. "At the very center of it are bits that 'prefer' more familiarity. And as you move out, then there is greater and greater preference for being active for novelty," Vatansever said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also probed whether navigating familiar and unfamiliar areas activated broader brain networks, or groups of cells spread throughout the brain that often activate in sync. Familiar areas activated networks previously linked to motor control and memory, whereas novel areas activated networks associated with focus and perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This division may help the brain adapt to new environments by focusing on and absorbing relevant details, Vatansever said. Then, memory and motor control combine to help navigate familiar areas, he proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings may explain some of the earliest signs of dementia, Vatansever suggested. The cells within the gradients in the cortex and hippocampus happen to be among the first brain areas affected by Alzheimer's disease.

Episodic memory is also especially vulnerable in the early stages of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how navigation is encoded in the brain could reveal measurable signs of dementia's earliest stages, when the ability to navigate begins to falter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you wanted to enhance people's ability to be independent, you'd want them to be able to go to new places and understand new things," Patai said. "In that sense, the link between spatial novelty and memory is really interesting."&lt;/p&gt;

It’s an eating disorder that’s characterized as an obsession with only consuming “healthy” foods—and it’s on the rise, says Sadi Fox, PhD, a licensed psychotherapist who specializes in eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="1" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;We all have that friend who talks a little too much about things like “clean eating,” or that random food group they’re entirely avoiding in pursuit of better health. Think: carbs, sugar, gluten (provided they don’t have an allergy). The problem? Orthorexia can result in nutritional deficiencies, mental health challenges, and social isolation. It can also be a “slippery slope” for other disordered behaviors, Fox says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Still, the signs of orthorexia can be very difficult to identify. Since eating healthy is generally perceived as a good thing, people with orthorexia might be praised for their disorder, not know they have a problem, and not end up getting the help they need—which is the case for some patients who work with Fox. “A lot of people are just like, ‘Whoa, I didn't even realize how deep [into my eating disorder] I was,’” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;When it comes to this sneaky mental health condition, signs and symptoms may be hard to spot.

It’s important to note that the foods people avoid aren’t always based on good, accurate information. People with orthorexia might make choices based on different approaches they see on social media, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s backed by science, says Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In reality, if you ask a nutritionist, cutting out entire groups of foods, no matter what they are, can result in a pretty unhealthy diet. Because their diets can become so restrictive, people who are orthorexic might lack key nutrients, not get sufficient calories for normal bodily functions, and have digestive issues like constipation, says Emily Van Eck, RD, a nutritionist who works with patients with eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;It’s not officially recognized in the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60722310/what-is-high-functioning-anxiety/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a60722310/what-is-high-functioning-anxiety/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="DSM-5" data-node-id="11.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.1.0"&gt;DSM-5&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the handbook for diagnosing mental disorders), but orthorexia is an eating disorder that has risen significantly over the past few years, according to the experts who treat it. Without formal diagnostic criteria, it’s challenging to determine exactly how many people in the U.S. struggle with orthorexia, per the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/orthorexia/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Eating Disorders Association" data-node-id="11.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.3.0"&gt;National Eating Disorders Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;—but prevalence varies across countries and populations, ranging from 6.9% in the Italian population to 88.7% in Brazil, per a 2021 review in the &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/10/5488" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/10/5488" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health" data-node-id="11.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.5.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.5.0.0"&gt;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.6"&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Other studies suggest orthorexia might be more common in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28251592/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Instagram users" data-node-id="11.8" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.8.0"&gt;Instagram users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (49% prevalence) &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457720303624" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2405457720303624" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="nutrition students" data-node-id="11.10" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.10.0"&gt;nutrition students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (72% prevalence), and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40337-023-00739-6" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40337-023-00739-6" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="populations that exercise" data-vars-ga-product-id="436a2df3-0574-471d-8287-bc4381943678" rel="nofollow" data-node-id="11.12" class="body-link product-links css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.12.0"&gt;populations that exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (55% prevalence). Plus, athletes and endurance athletes (runners especially) have higher symptom severity when it comes to orthorexia, according to a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10710386/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10710386/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity" data-node-id="11.14" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="11.14.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="11.14.0.0"&gt;Eating and Weight Disorders-Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Beyond the physical complications that come with orthorexia, the eating disorder is also associated with mental and emotional challenges, including dealing with shame, guilt, fear, and social isolation when it comes to food, says Rugless. “Their relationship with food becomes obsessive,” says Rugless. They might avoid social situations where they can’t control what they eat. Plus, the &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-062520-122331" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-062520-122331" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="stress" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;stress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that comes with an eating disorder can ruin your quality of life, says Van Eck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Compared to eating disorders like &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/eating-disorders" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="anorexia and bulimia" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="13.1.0"&gt;anorexia and bulimia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which a person’s primary motivation might be to change the look of their body, orthorexia typically starts with the goal to eat the healthiest foods possible, says Rugless. This goal doesn’t happen in a vacuum, though. “It’s diet culture’s newest attack,” says Fox. Media and social media’s support of things like “clean eating,” different harmful dietary practices, and general health misinformation may contribute to fears about “toxic” foods and could be supporting this uptick in orthorexia, per a 2023 study in &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490497/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10490497/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nutrients" data-node-id="13.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="13.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="13.3.0.0"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, social media is playing a role in the increase of this eating disorder, which can have serious consequences on someone’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="body-h2 css-rfu8 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="15.0"&gt;Signs And Symptoms Of Orthorexia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;How can you tell if someone is simply eating healthy or dealing with an eating disorder? Look for rigidity, says Rugless. If a friend is dividing foods into black and white categories (like “good” and “bad”) and cutting out entire food groups aside from allergies or religious and cultural traditions, that’s a sign they could be dealing with something deeper. They also might avoid certain restaurants, bring their own food, or refuse to eat altogether if they can’t access a food they’re okay with. They may also spend a lot of time researching food or spending money on health foods they can’t afford, adds Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;People who struggle with orthorexia tend to focus on not eating anything “harmful,” “damaging,” or “bad,” Rugless says. Instead, they consume foods they believe are “pure,” or “clean.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;“People are a bit moralistic about it,” says Fox. If you have a friend who feels particularly judgy about food—or even about what &lt;em data-node-id="19.1"&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; eat—that also might be a sign of an unhealthy relationship with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you think you or a loved one might be struggling with orthorexic behaviors, it’s always a good idea to talk to a therapist. If you’re not sure, here are some questions Fox tends to ask patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="21" class="css-kw9lqy emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.0"&gt;Is your diet representative of the different food groups?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.1"&gt;How does your diet make you feel?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.2"&gt;Does thinking about eating and food take up a lot of time in your life?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.3"&gt;Does what you eat cost an appropriate amount of money?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="21.4"&gt;Are you able to enjoy social gatherings around food?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="body-h2 css-rfu8 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="23.0"&gt;How is orthorexia diagnosed and treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Since orthorexia is not an official diagnosis in the DSM, there isn’t a set of clear clinical criteria to determine whether a person has it or not. However, if you’re exhibiting any of the above behaviors—like consistently fixating on food that you perceive to be “harmful,” avoiding restaurants, focusing on foods that you feel are “clean,” or any of the other behaviors mentioned, it’s likely a sign that you could be dealing with orthorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Working with a licensed therapist and a dietitian can help you navigate this eating disorder, Fox and Rugless say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Therapists might use &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/cognitive-behavioral" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="cognitive behavioral therapy" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="27.1.0"&gt;cognitive behavioral therapy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (CBT)—a type of psychotherapy focused on disrupting unhelpful thought patterns—to help you get back to the basics, make sure all food groups are represented in your diet and work on breaking down some of the ideas you might have about what makes something “healthy.” A dietitian can help make sure you're adequately nourishing your body, all while helping you fight misinformation you might have internalized about food.&lt;br data-node-id="27.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-rfu8 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;When To See A Doctor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;If you think you may be struggling with orthorexia or any other eating disorder, it’s always a good idea to check in with an eating disorder specialist—they can help you, no matter how far along you are.

(WXYZ) — A child in Oakland County has been diagnosed with Measles, the County's Health Division tells us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second case of measles found in the county this year. Health officials tell us people may have been exposed to measles at DMC Huron Valley-Sinai Hospital in Commerce Township on Dec. 7 in the Emergency Department between 7:20 p.m. and 11:10 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hospital and the health division are working to contact people who could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms to monitor include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red and watery eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;White spots on the inner cheeks, gums, and roof of mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on the face, spreads to the torso, arms, and legs 3-5 days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles symptoms usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear three weeks after exposure, health officials say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination is the most effective tool we have to prevent the spread of measles,” said Kate Guzman, Oakland County health officer, in a press release. “The measles (MMR) vaccine helps protect our community’s most vulnerable, which includes infants, children with medical conditions, and others who cannot be vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get the MMR vaccine through the Oakland County Health Division offices in Southfield and Pontiac, some health care providers, and many pharmacies. For more information on Oakland County's Health Division, &lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.oakgov.com/community/health"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Trump administration prepares to release the latest set of federal dietary guidelines, many health experts are concerned about where the government will land on saturated fats. While saturated fats have long been considered something to avoid, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said he plans to change that, but a new study &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/15/saturated-fat-intake-new-study-controversy-impact-dietary-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appears to disagree&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-recommendations-coming"&gt;New recommendations coming&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every five years, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publish the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The guidelines have long recommended limiting saturated fats to less than 10% of daily calories because they are associated with elevated cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the latest set of guidelines has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/us/politics/dietary-guidelines-americans.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;delayed until the new year&lt;/a&gt; because of the government shutdown, Kennedy has already said he plans for the “common sense” guidelines to “stress the need to eat saturated fats, dairy, good meat, fresh meat and vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://san.com/cc/rfk-jr-plans-radical-changes-to-dietary-guidelines/"&gt;called for the guidelines&lt;/a&gt; to promote full-fat dairy products and has publicly advocated for the use of beef tallow (which is 50% saturated fat) over vegetable and seed oils for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generally, the USDA and HHS follow the advice of their joint Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, but that trend could change for the 2025-2030 guidelines, since the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/2025-advisory-committee-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;most recent report&lt;/a&gt; sticks to the decades-old recommendation of keeping saturated fat intake at 10% or lower.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-study-old-science"&gt;New study, old science&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recently published study in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday found that people at low risk of developing cardiovascular disease did not experience the same benefits from a diet low in saturated fat as those at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors analyzed data from more than a dozen trials with more than 66,000 people. They examined how limiting the consumption of saturated fat affected a person’s cardiovascular health, cholesterol and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found that cutting down on saturated fats lowers cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attacks and stroke over the next five years for people who are already at a high risk. For those who don’t have the same concerns, lowering their saturated fat intake didn’t make much difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-experts-are-saying"&gt;What experts are saying&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts caution those at low risk for cardiovascular issues that the findings don’t necessarily mean saturated fats are harmless. It has been shown that saturated fats raise cholesterol, especially LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, which leads to plaque buildup in the arteries and can cause cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heart disease has been the &lt;mark class="has-inline-color"&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/mark&gt; in the United States since 1921. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fact-Card-Heart-Health.png" alt="" class="wp-image-533905" srcset="https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fact-Card-Heart-Health.png 720w, https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fact-Card-Heart-Health.png?resize=300,269 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You can’t measure something that hasn’t developed yet in people who don’t have disease,” Alice Lichtenstein, director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University, told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/study-finds-benefits-from-cutting-saturated-fats-as-rfk-jr-promotes-them-b39c56a3?gaa_at=eafs&amp;amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdRaqSEZrlbJ6grJP5JwMst8-wfjRJOtEy6mb-tdkGArOt44TZ4re7k6fql6Fs%3D&amp;amp;gaa_ts=6941662f&amp;amp;gaa_sig=yO20X4_uM5U7MEacAWC3L8ym1wqHRysnFS3AacAJvwvstV2Adl5Ckv8_LLo20E9zyOUMRzJpAA9g7SHMqUrZ_Q%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt;. “But the whole idea is you want to prevent it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lichtenstein was not associated with the study. Still, she said limiting saturated fats is the best advice for most people to prevent high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other experts disagree. Ramon Estruch and Rosa M. Lamuela-Raventós, with the University of Barcelona, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-25-04971" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;companion editorial&lt;/a&gt; for the study, “The findings of this review align with the current emerging recognition that dietary SFAs per se are unlikely deleterious for cardiometabolic health for the general population.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The health risks associated with saturated fat also vary by food. Processed foods like pizza are high in sodium, which can raise blood pressure. Compared with saturated fat in products such as milk and yogurt, saturated fat in other foods has been linked to weight loss and blood sugar control.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Heart disease remains the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
