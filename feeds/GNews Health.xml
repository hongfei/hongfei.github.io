			&lt;p&gt;We know that sitting for long periods of time &lt;a href="1-4-billion-adults-have-high-of-disease-from-not-enough-exercise-say-who" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;isn't good for us&lt;/a&gt;, but just how much exercise is needed to counteract the negative health effects of not escaping our desk all day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests about 30 to 40 minutes of building up a sweat should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committing to a good half our or so of "moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity" at some point each day ought to balance out 10 hours of sitting still, the research says – although any amount of exercise or even &lt;a href="even-2-hours-a-day-of-standing-instead-of-sitting-is-good-for-you-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;just standing up&lt;/a&gt; helps to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="165293" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; study published in 2020 analyzing nine previous studies, involving a total of 44,370 people in four different countries who were wearing some form of fitness tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a short summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found the risk of death among those with a more sedentary lifestyle went up as time spent engaging in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In active individuals doing about 30-40 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity, the association between high sedentary time and risk of death is not significantly different from those with low amounts of sedentary time," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Much Sitting Can Still Be Harmful Even if You Exercise, Study Warns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, putting in some reasonably intensive activities – cycling, brisk walking, gardening – can lower your risk of an earlier death right back down to what it would be if you weren't doing all that sitting around, to the extent that this link can be seen in the amassed data of many thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151064" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151064" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable.jpg" alt="Man Sitting At Table" class="wp-image-151064 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable-392x415.jpg 392w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable-600x636.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151064" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Too much time sitting down isn't good for you, but you might be able to offset the harm.

The &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (BHSM) also put out a &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;special edition&lt;/a&gt; to carry both the study and the revised guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As these guidelines emphasize, all physical activity counts and any amount of it is better than none," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/exercise-can-offset-the-risks-linked-to-sitting-around-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; physical activity and population health researcher Emmanuel Stamatakis from the University of Sydney in Australia&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People can still protect their health and offset the harmful effects of physical inactivity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research based on fitness trackers is broadly in line with the 2020 WHO guidelines, which recommend 150-300 mins of moderate intensity or 75-150 mins of vigorous intensity physical activity every week to counter sedentary behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132985" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors.jpg" alt="Older women in a pink top and black leggings lunging with small weights" class="size-full wp-image-132985" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/OlderPersonLungingIndoors-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132985" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Any amount of exercise is better than none.

As more data gets published, we should learn more about how to stay healthy even if we have to spend extended periods of time at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the new guidelines reflect the best available science, there are still some gaps in our knowledge," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/exercise-can-offset-the-risks-linked-to-sitting-around-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still not clear, for example, where exactly the bar for 'too much sitting' is.

However, not many are aware that their ways of entertainment can also be weird habits. A reel on social media has been proving this instance in the most hilarious way possible. The following video shows a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; showcasing many styles of burping that can leave anyone busting a gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever burping in different ways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;User @daisythegoldiee took to Instagram to share an adorable video of their Golden Retriever dog showing ways to burp. The popular page created by the owner is dedicated to the unmissable moments of the two Golden siblings, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/176650-dog-car-wash-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daisy and Maple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daisy and Maple&lt;/a&gt;. In the above-mentioned viral reel, Maple is seen flaunting her never-seen-before talent of burping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the pooch’s hooman decides to rate her burping skills to appreciate her talent. The first one is a “small but mighty baby Burp” of Maple, which receives a 9 out of 10. Later, the Golden shows her “I smell my own burp” burp, which goes on to receive an 11 out of 10. The next one is “I ate a lot of yoghurt and now I’am really full” burp. This cute burp with a little yoghurt stain on the canine’s nose gets full marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Maple’s “Head Scratchies Burp” scores a 9 out of 10 while “the dainty lady burp” is an 8. Furthermore, the “Huh?. It wasn’t me.” burp receives a 9 as well. The last but not the least is none other than the “multi-tasking burp.” This turns out to be the best burp as the hooman rates it as a 12 out of 10. Maple’s owner, finding joy in the pet’s burps, proves how a dog’s weird habits can also be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, this funny reel has garnered over 20K likes, more than 245K views, and over 3K shares. Users also shared their reactions in the comment section, with one writing, “i like the multi tasking burp.” One more commented, “All of her burps are 100/10.” A third user stated, “I’d like to request more of this series please and thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180752-golden-retriever-burp-instagram-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:22:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1pZERIaGZZblhpbkVfbDhTWVBwRGphNV9pWjRheS0wTnNaRlNkWXRSQWVUdERCMndCaEVmc213RjRKV3ZoeXF4UndLek1nak1OUzRYYUFla19qTlAwSVZxM1c4VkM5OTVEdnFWdC1ZR2lXWl9IM1E</guid></item><item><title>热度上升时保护身心的3种方法-《华盛顿邮报》 | 3 ways to protect your mind and body when the heat rises - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikgFBVV95cUxNQ211TFVvRTN2MmYyaXRraWxpMWRWVnR3cC13UnJUb2pDbjY5OXozbENMX09WelZwVGlwNFBkRUUwN0xVelBlVVBLNjdSWHMzR1hxSEZiTDRjOTNfNmdJNllYNWJCLXlNTHNST21ZdXdTRkdISlJZUS1jYS1xamNwcnlRSW02cVVrcm1Sc1cxWHBFQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ELVAA3INPVFANKH2562X7FYWWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As our Climate team has previously reported, “&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/05/27/summer-forecast-humidity-drought-charts-maps/" target="_blank"&gt;warmer-than-average conditions are likely in much of the country&lt;/a&gt;” from June to August, with many states predicted to experience &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/06/23/heat-wave-humidity-east-coast-forecast/" target="_blank"&gt;record-breaking temperatures&lt;/a&gt;. And while much of the focus on extreme heat is the immediate risk to human health, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/20/chronic-heat-exposure-illness/" target="_blank"&gt;chronic heat can cause a range of chronic health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Days and years of exposure to persistent heat can tax the heart and kidneys, disrupt sleep and challenge our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CPQMBNYJUJFNZERRDR2DJZCCPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To protect yourself, give yourself time to acclimatize to the heat and stay hydrated. “The first 10 to 15 days of anyone doing any new activity in a warm environment are really important to progressively and gradually do that. Because you allow your body time to adapt,” said &lt;a href="https://kins.uconn.edu/person/rebecca-stearns/" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Stearns&lt;/a&gt;, the chief operating officer of the &lt;a href="https://ksi.uconn.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Korey Stringer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit housed&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at the University of Connecticut dedicated to studying and preventing heatstroke in athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ND4PWW4X5A7FBZKXWS3SRWZYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Don’t exercise outdoors alone, and learn to recognize the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fextreme-heat%2Fsigns-symptoms%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;signs of heatstroke&lt;/a&gt; in yourself and others. Getting out of the heat, even for a few hours, is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/413470" target="_blank"&gt;protective during heat waves&lt;/a&gt;. Air conditioning and electric fans can help, but may not always be available, such as during a power outage. Dousing the skin in water may be an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2752456" target="_blank"&gt;effective alternative&lt;/a&gt; or going to designated &lt;a href="https://nchh.org/information-and-evidence/learn-about-healthy-housing/emergencies/extreme-heat/cooling-centers-by-state/" target="_blank"&gt;cooling centers&lt;/a&gt; in your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6EDUAMCEPBCJHDJPL5GFJUF6SA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you feel unwell, weak, confused or agitated, those are all “red flags,” Stearns said.

Often referred to as the cell’s “scaffolding,” it plays many vital roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where in the body it is, it generally provides structural support, stops different tissues from sticking together, enhances cell-to-cell communication, and assists in wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it matter for heart health? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of the recent paper, which appears in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02234-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, “it is widely acknowledged that the mechanics, organization, and composition of the ECM vary with age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explain that these ECM changes may play a part in the stiffening of the cardiac muscle that occurs as we grow older. Age-related changes trigger so-called cardiac fibroblasts, which can lead to fibrosis: A buildup of connective tissue, as seen in scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fibrosis is an important function and helps repair heart tissue after damage, when it is uncontrolled, it leads to a stiffer, less flexible ECM. In the case of the heart, this can make it &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;less efficient at pumping blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the ECM is relatively novel. “Most aging research focuses on how cells change over time,” &lt;a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/new-biomaterial-shows-ageing-in-heart-could-be-reversed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/jennifer-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jennifer Young&lt;/a&gt;, senior author of the study and assistant professor at the Mechanobiology Institute of the National University of Singapore. “Our study looks instead at the ECM and how changes in this environment affect heart aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help uncover the role of the ECM in heart health, the team designed a new, hi-tech model called DECellularized In Situ Polyacrylamide Hydrogel-ECM hybrid (DECIPHER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model was created using heart tissue from a rat and a lab-created gel that shares physical properties with ECM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the authors explain, it was unclear whether changes in cell signaling or changes in tissue stiffness were most responsible for age-related declines in heart function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DECIPHER platform solves this problem,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/student/avery-rui-sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Avery Rui Sun&lt;/a&gt;, first author of the study, in a &lt;a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/new-biomaterial-shows-ageing-in-heart-could-be-reversed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. He explains how it allows “researchers to independently control the stiffness and the biochemical signals presented to the cells — something no previous system using native tissue has been able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, they could adjust the model and see what happens when cell signalling occurs as it does in a young heart, but with an older, stiffer ECM. Conversely, they could mimic the biochemical signals of an aged heart with a young, flexible ECM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that “young” cell signaling outweighed the negative effects of the stiffer ECM. In reverse, young cells placed on “aged” ECM showed signs of dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies that “the biochemical environment around aged heart cells matters more than stiffness,” explains Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; reached out to &lt;a href="https://vitalsolution.com/interventional-cardiology-a-commitment-to-lifelong-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nishant Kalra, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist, chief medical officer at VitalSolution — an Ingenovis Health company — who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surface molecules (ligands) found in young heart tissue can prevent the activation of fibrosis-promoting cells, even when the tissue is as stiff as aged heart tissue, which points to new ways to target the extracellular environment to slow heart aging,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human studies next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work provides a platform for identifying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse age-related cardiac dysfunction.

Sleep deprivation can negatively impact heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight management: &lt;/strong&gt;Obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress reduction: &lt;/strong&gt;Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These behaviors,” he continued, “are consistently associated with reduced biological and cardiovascular aging, as shown in large epidemiological studies and supported by the American Heart Association.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also reached out to &lt;a href="https://uk.treated.com/medical-team/dr-daniel-atkinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Daniel Atkinson, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician from the United Kingdom, working for a private healthcare company called Treated.

She wishes she could shout “fiber, fiber, fiber” from the rooftops.

One thing I see a lot is older adults not drinking enough water. They don’t feel thirsty as often, so it just slips their mind. These are basics that are easy to overlook but really affect how people feel day to day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Flashpop via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Flashpop via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“I often emphasize that having some healthy fat stores is actually protective as we age," said Dr. Elaine Healy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, there’s the issue of protein. As you age, you’re already facing a decrease in muscle mass, and that’s a concern, even if you’ve never been the body-building type. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yorktownhealth.com/provider/shawn-george-d-o" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Shawn George" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yorktownhealth.com/provider/shawn-george-d-o" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Shawn George&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an internal medicine physician, “Loss of muscle can lead to weakness, falls and a decline in mobility. To combat this, protein needs actually increase with age, as it helps maintain muscle mass and strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I recommend older patients focus on consuming higher amounts of protein throughout the day, sources like lean meats, eggs, beans and Greek yogurt, spread across meals, rather than relying on just one protein-heavy meal. For someone in their 60s or beyond, aiming for at least 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is a good target. It’s about making sure the body has the building blocks it needs to stay strong and functional for as long as possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every bite counts, these experts said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.centerwellprimarycare.com/en/doctors/tamea-deshawn-evans-md.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Tamea Evans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.centerwellprimarycare.com/en/doctors/tamea-deshawn-evans-md.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Tamea Evans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an internal medicine physician and diabetologist, suggested that seniors should focus on high-impact foods, which she described as those that pack a nutritional punch even in smaller, more senior-friendly sized portions. She used natural peanut butter as an example: “It’s a great source of healthy fats, some sugar, calories, protein, vitamins and minerals, all in one spoonful. The key is choosing foods that are rich in things such as fiber and good fats, so every bite counts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of focusing on weight, focus on strength instead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to nutrition, there’s also the issue of weight. Happily, there might be some good news here from Rao. “Being in shape is actually better for longevity than being skinny,” she said. “As you age, you want to focus on maintaining strength and mobility, rather than just weight. Ensuring that you maintain lean muscle mass is crucial as you age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;““The body may not bounce back like it used to, but it’s still incredibly responsive to care — especially when you give it better fuel.””&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wouldn’t obsess over the scale, but staying strong matters more than ever,” Burgess said. “It’s less about a goal weight and more about keeping your heart, muscles and joints in tip-top shape.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few more pounds might even be a good idea, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uhgc.org/team/elaine-healy-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Elaine Healy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uhgc.org/team/elaine-healy-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Elaine Healy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, vice president of medical affairs and medical director at United Hebrew Geriatric Center. “I often emphasize that having some healthy fat stores is actually protective as we age. Particularly for older women, who may have been naturally slender their whole lives, it’s important not to fear a few extra pounds. It’s not about promoting obesity, but rather ensuring there are enough reserves to withstand health challenges.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’ve never eaten well, should you start now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://enableu.com.au/about/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Janet Phile" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://enableu.com.au/about/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Janet Phile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered nurse who specializes in complex care for those with aging-related challenges, said that you can start eating better, and feeling better, at any age. “It boosts your energy and immune system, and it may help you live longer,” she said. “It’s never too late to treat your body better. I’ve had patients in their 70s and 80s who improved inflammatory markers, cognitive clarity and mobility when they committed to eating more nourishing foods.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ormond agrees, saying, “Your body is still capable of healing and adapting — even in your 70s, 80s or beyond. I’ve seen people feel more alert, sleep better and move with less pain, just from making small nutrition changes. You don’t need a lifetime of perfect eating for it to be worth it. Start now, and you’ll feel the difference.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheema said that the effort will be totally worth it if you start feeling better. “If you start eating more heart-healthy foods, like leafy greens or fish, your brain and blood flow benefit, too. That can keep your memory sharp and help you stay independent longer. So don’t worry if your earlier habits weren’t great before — what you do now still counts. It’s worth the effort at any age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating well leads to feeling good, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Raj Dasgupta" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a quadruple board-certified physician specializing in internal medicine, pulmonology, critical care and sleep medicine, and chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews. “You can feel better, move more easily and even manage chronic conditions more effectively just by improving your eating habits,” he said. “The body may not bounce back like it used to, but it’s still incredibly responsive to care — especially when you give it better fuel.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNC1QdEJJYVpOSTkyS1F2RzBvcG9TdmN1QllNcXo1WHJBeER6MXVtYnVSMXZHNXVwdk82emZ4dUUtR090QzFUc1pZZUV1SUZRRk9va1RhQWtDY3J4cW94RE9WOWg5QUFVWFBvRkNzNE9UY1c4dWFCOUlfVFJkWVdJbXZEU2NwejZBU3A0WDQxci02TDhqQkF5Um8xOFjSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFZRbjRmNC1sMzVtNDMxbjdFTEpnNU9mSGk4cVRmZy12QTFTcGpHRGVBT29xRENHUnZlOXl0VE1VdWtfazhaRE1STEpZZUdoUXdLSE5tenFLTW13d1p5c1p1LU9YTVR1ZFpDZDcwMm9OaTB0S1VEWVY1VEFyemVGY0RsRk93SW12TVBKYjNlVnp5eWwtMUhZNElBbThreFRGQnZ3</guid></item><item><title>专家说，这7种微妙的行为可能是伪装的“肥胖症” - HuffPost | Experts Say These 7 Subtle Behaviors Might Be 'Bigorexia' In Disguise - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOdW9XREFqX3poaGNLRDRXY05FOVUwNGcxR3lzWE81UWRmSzRVWVh5eUNONVNIOVY3WkktSUtJR3Q4Mk1ENmlqanlmMlZsWUFVb1kxbjJaazVyQ2JBd1RzTVdZQlNDd3BjSnY5cXRzTVlYbnZRM01EbjFqV0NJd0ZxbnZod2syMWFyTXlyVWYzTDltbTjSAZgBQVVfeXFMUG1wUmRITGNEOFI2cHBwbHJVSXBVUXpyTEtiZnpWNmoxS08xTHB1WFZ3bk54RHJ0TVBRYzRtdGpNSHB2VGFyd21hOUNZMzE5TVJKTVQtWG5laDd0U2l0aFpsU1hLcUZpbno4NVotZUdvdER4NWVKeGtjMlJIRUxta2ZSVGRoX05GNXNjNzFNZFEtM2xMY0ZIV24?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to body image disorders, the idea of a teenage or young woman probably comes to mind.

Exercising compulsively. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is, of course, a good thing when done properly and in moderation — it benefits &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart/physical-activity/benefits" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cardiovascular health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart/physical-activity/benefits" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, mental health, &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="bone health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and more. But in folks with bigorexia, exercise can become an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trunzo, if your child is constantly exercising or doing it too frequently, you should take notice. This may look like hours and hours spent at the gym each day or long periods of time in your basement home gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people struggling with bigorexia tend to turn to certain kinds of exercise, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bigorexia predominantly focuses on musculature and muscle size and muscle gain. So you don’t really see these kids doing long track workouts and running marathons,” explained Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on stamina or even weight loss, people with bigorexia are trying to develop superhero-like physique, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also might look like guilt when they aren’t at the gym, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Again, physical activity is supposed to be good for our health, but for people with muscle dysmorphia, it becomes a chore, it becomes a preoccupation, and they feel bad and guilty if they’re not at the gym all the time,” Nagata explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the actual exercise, it’s how the exercise makes them feel, Nagata added. If your child is complaining that they feel bad that they didn’t go to the gym today or are overly upset when they miss a workout regimen, take note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Withdrawing from activities they normally like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Muscle dysmorphia is a mental health condition, so it often leads to disruptions in quality of life, daily functioning,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These young men often become so obsessed with their fitness routine or their eating regimen that it also impacts their social life, their school work or their actual work if they’re in the workforce, Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s generally some sort of impairment in functioning [and] lower quality of life,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may see your loved one withdrawing from things they normally enjoy, whether that’s movie night with their friends or a trip with their cousins. And this is because of issues with their body appearance and what they “need” to do to follow their strict rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Becoming upset if it’s suggested that they break their diet plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with bigorexia often has a preoccupation with dieting and calorie intake, according to Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often they’ll religiously count their calories or their macros in a restrictive way, and even if they’re trying to bulk up, they’ll refuse to eat certain foods if they don’t help build muscle (think of ingredients with high sugar levels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, they likely have strong food rules that don’t allow for much leeway. And if there is a deviation from their set food plan or ideal caloric intake, they’ll likely get mad or upset, Trunzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the restrictive food days, someone with bigorexia may also allow themselves to have a “cheat day” when they can eat whatever they want, but that is problematic, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s really a lot of overlap with that and binge eating, but it’s just been kind of reclaimed or rebranded in a positive light, but some of the behaviors themselves can still have health risks,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Not eating enough food to fuel their workouts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food is designed to fuel us, and the more you exercise, the more you need to consume. But for someone with bigorexia, their high levels of exercise likely don’t match their pretty normal intake of food, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [food] intake is very, very low, and that leads to the starvation state in bigorexia, some of these individuals may have a ‘normal’ food intake ... but the energy output is often massive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they may be eating a diet that is sufficient for someone who exercises regularly, but not excessively, it’s not enough food for someone who is constantly at the gym. This can have devastating consequences on the body, such as entering into a starvation of malnutrition state, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Darrin Klimek via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Darrin Klimek via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A young man with bigorexia may spend hours and hours weightlifting to bulk up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Taking lots of supplements and protein powders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for young people with bigorexia to engage in excessive supplement use, which includes taking over-the-counter products from stores like GNC and your local pharmacy, in addition to protein powders, said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these products are legal, as with other &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="supplements in this country" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;supplements in this country&lt;/a&gt;, “most of them are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, you can buy them online, you can often buy them at grocery stores or just over the counter, but because of current laws and lack of regulation, actually anything in the supplement category is not really rigorously tested for safety or effectiveness,” Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products can be tainted or mislabeled, Nagata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you (or your child) do take supplements, look for USP-certified or NSF-certified products, because this rating guarantees safety, &lt;a href="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8&amp;amp;subId3=xid:fr1750699954074faf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gina Milano" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8&amp;amp;subId3=xid:fr1750699954074faf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Gina Milano&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical dietitian at Stanford Health Care in California &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/magnesium-sleep-stress-social-media-trend_l_641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="previously told HuffPost" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;previously told HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.

Constantly checking their appearance in the mirror.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirror checking often is associated with eating disorders like anorexia, but is also seen in young men with bigorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re always looking at themselves in the mirror, and checking their physical appearance,” said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the occasional peek in the mirror to make sure your hair is in place and your shirt isn’t too wrinkled, instead, it’s obsessively looking in every nearby mirror and reflective surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, pressure from social media is a big driver of bigorexia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, the average person didn’t have a view into a celebrity’s or influencer’s everyday routine. Aside from movies or print news articles, there wasn’t any more insight into a famous person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, though, social media gives everyone — kids included — a peek into the exercise routines, food regimens and daily life of rich and famous people. And this only hurts a kid’s body image, both experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The constant bombardment from social media, I think, has been a real driver in the increases that we’re seeing in kids having these issues with body dysmorphic disorder, and specifically with bigorexia,” said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not realistic to think that your child will be shielded from social media forever, so instead of avoiding the topic, address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a parent, you want to know what your kid is seeing on social media, what they’re seeing on TV, or what they’re seeing in the movies, and then you want to talk to them about that,” Trunzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trunzo, you can do this by asking them how they think a certain celebrity looks in a picture. If the child responds with something like, “They look great, I wish I looked like that,” explain to them what goes into these seemingly unposed photos — such as editing, lighting, private chefs, personal trainers and plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too early to start having these kinds of discussions with your child, said Trunzo. This way, they’ll understand that what they’re looking at, whether on TikTok or in a movie, isn’t real and isn’t how they should aim to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if a loved one shows any of the above signs of bigorexia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, understand that bigorexia is a serious mental health condition that can cause huge physical and mental health implications, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have concerns, you should get professional help,” Nagata said. Your primary care provider or pediatrician is a good place to start as they can conduct assessments and evaluation, and provide referrals, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think, in general, muscle dysmorphia is — and eating disorders are — best supported by an interdisciplinary team, including a mental health, medical and nutrition provider,” Nagata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Scientists at King’s College London have developed a revolutionary &lt;strong&gt;nanoneedle patch&lt;/strong&gt; that is thinner than a human hair, enabling painless biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💉 The patch collects detailed &lt;strong&gt;molecular information&lt;/strong&gt; from tissues without cutting or scarring, offering a non-invasive alternative to traditional biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 This innovation could transform &lt;strong&gt;disease diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt; and monitoring, particularly for conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer’s, through real-time molecular analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤝 Developed through interdisciplinary collaboration, the patch promises faster, more accurate medical decisions, heralding a new era of &lt;strong&gt;personalized medicine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biopsies have long been a necessary but often painful procedure for diagnosing various medical conditions. However, a revolutionary new development from scientists at King’s College London promises to change this narrative. A microscopic patch, bristling with nanoneedles and thinner than a human hair, offers a pain-free alternative to traditional biopsies. This breakthrough could transform how diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s are diagnosed and monitored, eliminating the need for invasive procedures that often involve scalpels and needles. The potential implications for patient care and medical diagnostics are profound and far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Revolutionary Patch: A Leap in Medical Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanoneedle-studded patch represents a significant advancement in medical technology. Unlike traditional biopsies that require removing tissue samples, this patch painlessly collects detailed molecular data from tissues without cutting or scarring. The patch’s nanoneedles are roughly 1,000 times thinner than a human hair, allowing them to extract molecular “fingerprints” such as lipids, proteins, and mRNA directly from living cells. This method offers an unprecedented level of detail and accuracy in molecular diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed through a collaboration involving experts in nanoengineering, clinical oncology, cell biology, and artificial intelligence, this patch could revolutionize personalized medicine. By providing a real-time window into disease progression and treatment response, it allows for more accurate and timely medical decisions. The ability to sample the same tissue multiple times, without destroying it, is a significant advancement over traditional biopsy techniques. This innovation holds promise for improving outcomes for patients with complex conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZEcurf0NMO"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/quantum-laws-just-got-twisted-u-s-engineers-use-entangled-light-to-project-mind-bending-3d-holograms-in-real-time/"&gt;“Quantum Laws Just Got Twisted”: U.S. Engineers Use Entangled Light to Project Mind-Bending 3D Holograms in Real Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transforming Disease Monitoring and Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this nanoneedle patch extend beyond mere diagnostics. It could fundamentally change how diseases are tracked and treated. By enabling frequent, non-invasive sampling, doctors can make faster, more informed decisions about surgeries and treatment plans. For instance, in brain surgery, the patch allows surgeons to quickly assess molecular data from suspicious areas, enabling more precise and targeted interventions. This capability reduces delays in treatment and improves surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch’s potential for integration into everyday medical devices, such as contact lenses and bandages, further enhances its utility. Manufactured using techniques similar to those used for computer chips, these nanoneedles can be mass-produced, making them accessible for widespread medical use. This innovation could soon bring diagnosis and monitoring directly to the skin’s surface, offering a seamless and efficient way to manage health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

Far from being harmless in moderation, drinking—whether casually or regularly—has been shown to significantly shorten life expectancy and increase cancer risk. In a study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, lead researcher Dr. Tim Stockwell and his colleagues concluded that even small amounts of alcohol can be harmful. Dr. Stockwell later told the Daily Mail that as little as two drinks per week may shave off several days from your life, while regular drinking could cost you years. This shift in understanding is not only scientific but cultural, challenging decades of messaging that moderate drinking, particularly wine, might be good for your heart or longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New research quantifies how alcohol consumption shortens your lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Stockwell, a leading researcher in alcohol studies, has drawn attention to just how sharply alcohol impacts longevity. In media interviews following the study, he provided estimates that frame alcohol's toll in tangible terms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just 2 drinks per week might cut life expectancy by 3 to 6 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming 7 drinks a week essentially one per day could cost you 2.5 months of life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 35 drinks per week, the average individual could lose up to 2 years from their lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are based on population averages, meaning the actual impact on an individual can vary depending on genetics, health and other habits. Still, the risk is clear. The new findings undermine earlier beliefs that a little alcohol may be protective, particularly for heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they highlight a consistent dose-response relationship. The more you drink, the higher your risk of early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding alcohol’s link to cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol’s role in causing cancer is now well-established in scientific literature. Dr. Helen Croker, Assistant Director of Research and Policy at the WCRF, explains that alcohol is metabolised into acetaldehyde, a toxic compound that directly damages DNA. This leads to mutations and increases the risk of developing several types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly vulnerable organs and tissues include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouth and throat due to direct exposure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liver the main organ for detoxifying alcohol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colon and rectum especially at higher intake levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Harriet Rumgay from the WHO, men who drink two pints per day face:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;  A 38% greater risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 94% increase in the risk of mouth or throat cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An 84% higher risk of liver cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even drinking at the so-called “moderate” level of one drink per day has been associated with a 17% increased risk of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much is too much?

However, researchers like Dr. Croker clarify that these benefits do not outweigh the harms of alcohol itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the same polyphenols in red wine are found in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the plant compounds are beneficial, consuming them through alcoholic drinks defeats the purpose. The WCRF now recommends avoiding alcohol altogether, including red wine, for those concerned about cancer or long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The negative impact of alcohol far outweighs any perceived cardiovascular benefits,” says Dr. Croker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why men struggle more with cutting down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social norms and peer pressure play a significant role in male drinking habits. According to research by Professor Richard Cooke from Staffordshire University, men are less likely to think about their health and often feel pressured to match their friends’ drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 WCRF survey found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25% of men feel judged or “boring” when they refuse drinks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 in 5 men has called in sick after weekday drinking (vs. 1 in 10 women)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50% of men use excuses not to drink rather than openly declining&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooke’s advice includes setting personal motivations for cutting back, such as wanting to feel mentally sharper, avoiding hangovers or being a better role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter strategies for moderation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of quitting entirely, many men may benefit from mindful drinking. Here are Cooke’s and WCRF’s top strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Low or no-alcohol alternatives allow you to stay social without increasing cancer risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Bookending” start and end your night with non-alcoholic drinks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spacing out drinking days your weekly total matters more than just weekend binges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track your units many underestimate their intake; apps and calculators can help.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The final word: it all adds up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol’s health effects are cumulative, meaning even low-level, long-term drinking increases your lifetime risk of disease and death. Experts now urge rethinking drinking norms, especially for men over 40, where health risks compound with age and weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a celebratory pint here and there is unlikely to do major harm, the science is clear.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A leading nutritionist has warned how you brew your coffee could raise your risk of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; But, on the other hand, she added, coffee also contains 'fat-soluble diterpenes' that raise both cancer and heart disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because diterpenes are known to increase bad cholesterol 'in just a few weeks'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bad' cholesterol, or LDL, is a fatty substance that builds up in blood vessels, interfering with blood flow to and from the heart, and raising the risk of damage to the organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traditional paper drip and instant cold brew are both filtered brewing methods she recommended that can lower your risk of cancers and heart trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They trap diterpenes essentially eliminating their negative effects whilst still preserving beneficial polyphenols,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she warned against methods that use equipment containing harmful microplastics that can also work their way into your coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Hot water to plastic will accelerate the release of microplastics into your beverage, as well as your plastic associated chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'So if you are going to do filtered coffee, pour over is probably your best bet. Doing something into a glass container and not having hot water touch plastic,' she added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unfiltered methods have been linked to cancer risk as it increases the chance harmful compounds can find their way into your cup &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nutritionist also advised against using a french press, or any method that involves pouring boiling water over fresh coffee grounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She warned of similar risks of using popular espresso pods, explaining how chemicals are released when hot water runs through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Patrick's warning comes after scientists discovered too much instant coffee could increase the risk of some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because the popular caffeinated drink contains twice as much acrylamide than ground coffee — a chemical substance produced when some food, including coffee beans, is cooked at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The product has been declared as a 'problem human carcinogen' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning there is evidence the chemical could cause cancer in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory tests revealed acrylamide in the diet causes lung and reproductive cancers in animals and scientists agree that it has the potential for similar effects in humans, according to the Food Standards Agency (FSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Polish study from 2013 that analysed 42 samples of coffee, including ten instant coffees, revealed instant coffee had double the amount of acrylamide than freshly ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, you would need to drink about ten cups of instant coffee a day for your intake of acrylamide to become a concern, according to researchers at McGill University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some 80 per cent of UK households buy instant coffee, particularly those aged over 65, according to research by the British Coffee Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Psychiatry;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; study found that walking for an hour a day can reduce the risk of depression by 26%. “It also strengthens your muscles and bones and decreases the risks of chronic diseases too,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-make-your-walks-more-challenging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make your walks more challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny stresses that any walks is better than none, especially if your activity level is currently lower than you’d prefer. But if you’re ready to kick the intensity up a notch, experts recommend doing these modifications to make your walking workouts more challenging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="push-the-pace"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push the pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s easy to get content with moving at whatever speed feels good to you. But if you feel comfortable at your current pace, it’s time to take things to the next level. “Increasing your pace will make it more challenging,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny suggests moving at a speed where you start to breathe more heavily and trying to maintain that. Taking &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/walk-faster-10-tips-picking-115102236.html" data-ylk="slk:shorter steps rather than longer strides;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;shorter steps rather than longer strides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bending your elbows to about 90 degrees and pumping your arms for momentum, can help you maintain a faster clip. Once you feel good at faster speeds, he suggests that you push the pace to the point where you could almost break into a jog, while still sticking with a low-impact workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can also track your speed with a fitness app to keep tabs on your progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-interval-workouts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do interval workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interval training simply means alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity activity in a workout. “Interval training gives your body an opportunity to push itself while allowing for proper recovery in between intervals,” Ellis says. By keeping your body “guessing,” it can help to improve your fitness and calorie burn, Matheny says. “This is a great way to incorporate a low-impact ‘high-intensity interval training,’” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a few ways to approach this. One is that you can simply move faster during your walks for a certain period of time, like a minute or two, before slowing down to recover and then speeding up again. But Matheny says you can also incorporate things like step-ups on a park bench during your walks to help quickly increase your heart rate, before continuing with your walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="add-more-distance--but-not-too-much-at-once"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more distance — but not too much at once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just like any form of exercise, ramping up the intensity or distance too fast raises the risk of injury. “Ten thousand steps a day is the sweet spot,” Pack says. “But for someone who may only be at 3,000 steps a day, they can gradually add more distance over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She suggests adding an additional 1,000 steps a week until you hit your target step count. “Maybe the first goal is to hit 4,000 a day for a week; then 5,000 the next week,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="use-weights--but-not-hand-weights"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use weights — but not hand weights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny recommends adding weights to your walks to push yourself “after you feel like you can't walk any faster.” But experts agree that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/should-you-be-wearing-a-weighted-vest-on-your-daily-walks-100017788.html" data-ylk="slk:a weighted vest is a better option;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a weighted vest is a better option&lt;/a&gt; than using hand weights. “Hand weights can throw off your normal walking gait,” raising the risk of injury, Matheny explains. “It doesn’t give you a good arm workout either,” he adds. Pack agrees. “A vest gives equal weight distribution; hand weights may not and could be harder on joints,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many weighted vests allow you to add more weights over time to increase the intensity, giving you plenty of mileage out of this investment. “Wearing a weighted vest and adding resistance is a great option to challenge your body during walks,” Ellis says. “That improves bone density and strengthens your core musculature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="crank-up-the-incline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crank up the incline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is easier if you’re on a treadmill, but you can also walk up hills outside. Walking on an incline “will increase your heart rate and can incorporate more glutes and hamstring involvement,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re on a treadmill, she recommends walking at different inclines to switch up the challenge. So that could mean walking at an incline of five, before switching to eight and then back to five, all in the same workout. For outdoor walks, that may simply mean finding a hilly route near you, Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, trainers stress the importance of keeping things fresh to get the most out of your walking workouts. “Challenge yourself,” Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQUV82eE9rbmtLY0F1WVFCQVFHcWZjeGt2RThaV09scU9XTVVMVFdXTnlla2swSHZBVDZGSWhTcW95cTZCc05IMkMwLVNaU0VINEppeXRiZW03bFoycTh5UmpzT1cxMXNDMzNzcE16MTdoMWNRZEl1bXdZU3hxZ05LaTJtRTBzV1lzNXhVYzBrMWpZSTYtT3dKdUl0eXNFeWZ5SHZaT0ZPWVZIZlpiYkdiaEpjNk1KdWJZMVJpc0pGQUNfM2U1M1hZYmdzZDYtSkxsS05NUVlGRG5kQQ</guid></item><item><title>TikTok禁止# SkinnyTok。但宣传不健康饮食的内容仍然存在- NPR | TikTok bans #SkinnyTok.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The social media platform TikTok recently banned a hashtag called #SkinnyTok after European regulators warned it was promoting &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/28/1263527105/steroids-men-body-image" target="_blank"&gt;unrealistic body images &lt;/a&gt;and extreme weight loss.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company had seen an onslaught of content featuring emaciated-looking young women peddling tips on how to drop weight quickly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now the hashtag may be gone, but eliminating this kind of harmful content is not that simple. There's still no shortage of people — on TikTok and other social media platforms — spreading unhealthy information on how to eat fewer calories and get very, very thin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that consuming this type of content on social media &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5003636/" target="_blank"&gt;is correlated to&lt;/a&gt; a higher risk of disordered eating. Young women and girls are especially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to nutrition and wellness, it can be hard to disentangle the unhealthy from the healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You have many kinds of content in the gray zones," says &lt;a href="https://www.brookeduffy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Brooke Erin Duffy&lt;/a&gt;, who studies social media and culture at Cornell University. "Their regulation is much more difficult."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Creators are good at taking advantage of this murky ground, says Duffy. "As soon as there is an attempt for platforms to regulate or thwart a hashtag, anyone using the platform is gonna develop a workaround," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A popular meme called "What I eat in a day," for example, features people showing their daily food intake. Posts can either feature a balanced diet or one that could put someone in a dangerous calorie deficit. One young woman recently posted a video showing the single croissant she subsisted on in a day, whereas a different woman featured a balance of lean proteins and vegetables adding up to 1,800 calories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Body-positive counterprogramming&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some creators on the front lines of the body image battle are making their own counterprogramming. Athlete and creator Kate Glavan — who has nearly 150,000 followers — urges her followers to take seriously the dangers of content that glamorizes undernourishment.  She discusses her own struggle with an eating disorder in her videos.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of creators are explicitly promoting anorexia to their audience," Glavan says in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/7380018730572451115" target="_blank"&gt;a recent TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;. "It's dangerous. It's misinformed," she says, and she advises people to "block these creators."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that anorexia has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8429328/" target="_blank"&gt;the highest mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; of any psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But researchers who study this issue say &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/17/1196978085/nprs-book-of-the-day-draft-10-17-2023" target="_blank"&gt;body-positive content&lt;/a&gt; doesn't garner the same kinds of audiences — or profit. "Negative images that are unrealistic or show really thin people or really muscular people tend to have a more lasting impact than body-positive content&lt;strong&gt;," &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrisci.med.utoronto.ca/faculty/amanda-raffoul" target="_blank"&gt;says Amanda Raffoul,&lt;/a&gt; who researches eating disorders and social media at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Messaging that equates thinness with beauty is reinforced throughout society, Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul points to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015323000223" target="_blank"&gt; research that suggests&lt;/a&gt; consumption of body-positive content on social media does not necessarily provide protection against or counteract content that promotes unrealistic beauty standards or weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The way that they structure content and the way that they code algorithms to amplify certain types of messaging and even target certain types of messaging to specific users puts that information in the hands of more vulnerable people," Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though platforms aren't creating content, says Raffoul, they are responsible for how &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1224955473/social-media-algorithm-filterworld" target="_blank"&gt;aggressively they amplify&lt;/a&gt; different kinds of messaging or direct it at certain demographics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;TikTok declined a request for an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement stressed that they "regularly review safety measures to address evolving risks and have blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content." Searches on the platform for this term are redirected to the &lt;a href="https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/" target="_blank"&gt;National Alliance for Eating Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among other safety strategies, the company says it continues to restrict videos for teen accounts and redirect searches to health experts, as well as partner with advocacy groups that offer strategies around recognizing and treating eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A losing battle&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some body-positive warriors say the movement is having a low moment. "With the massive &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/13/1198912257/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-hollywood-body-positvity-future-us-obesity-shortage" target="_blank"&gt;rise of GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; and their widespread use as a quick fix weight loss solution, we've seen this return of the narrative that thin is back in," says &lt;a href="https://www.meganjaynecrabbe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Megan Jayne Crabbe,&lt;/a&gt; author of the recently published book &lt;em&gt;We Don't Make Ourselves Smaller Here. "&lt;/em&gt;The beauty standard has swung back towards extreme slimness," Crabbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;While Crabbe still creates content on social media, she says it's harder to break through with messaging that normalizes bigger bodies than it was a few years ago. She is glad to see #Skinnytok banned, but she says she sees a need for more soul searching on the question of beauty standards from Western culture.  "I think banning the hashtag is a surface-level plaster to a very deep wound," she says. "We are still deeply fat phobic as a society."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some content creators say the uphill battle against negative content around eating and skinny bodies is exhausting. "I don't really claim it anymore," says &lt;a href="https://the-dots.com/users/nyome-nicholas-williams-77718" target="_blank"&gt;Nyome Nicholas-Williams,&lt;/a&gt; of the term "body positivity." Nicholas-Williams — a Black woman and a plus-size model — says she feels pushed out of the movement that Black women started but she says has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9589104/#s3" target="_blank"&gt;been co-opted&lt;/a&gt;. "I'm more of like 'body neutrality,'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Nicholas-Williams &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/25/instagram-row-over-plus-size-model-forces-change-to-nudity-policy" target="_blank"&gt;publicly took on&lt;/a&gt; the social media platform Instagram, accusing the company of censoring content featuring Black plus-size models with different standards than those it used to police content featuring white, slim people. The company issued an apology and pledged to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nicholas-Williams says some of her public criticism of the social media platform has likely cost her business, but she thinks speaking out against dangerous content is an important strategy in combating it.  "People speaking up and being brave," she says, "that's what it takes."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul, who studies nutrition and social media at the University of Toronto, says the profit should not be overlooked. "Every second, every minute that we spend on these platforms is being monetized," says Raffoul, who points out that eating disorders and ideals around unattainable thinness have been around for decades, but that social media platforms allow for a new delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul believes it will take lawmakers forcing change in order to create meaningful protection from dangerous content through these new channels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Until that happens, she says, the best strategy to combat it is not to look at it at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Debunking a common fear about kids’ vaccines - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOeFJiaGw2YVBRcWNHRFFJVDlXZUhxc1hwMnJ2Y2p5RW5uNGJrcTFoMnFPSmdHampMRmVjNTk1Q0NaMnM0YUs4VWZKNTg1b2kwMHd5aHdiQWtsdktRdVVuZERFSUk4ODVXWDJGS2UzcjR3bGZIdUNBS1dRTzl6ZTNjaEZZZk9oNjhBcmFPcS1FZXFmX2ZMdFFnMXJpN2pJVHZfTFNWZUllY0x2LVE3LXoyREVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, a typical child was recommended to receive 11 vaccine doses — seven injections and four oral. Today, that number has risen to 50 to 54 doses by age 18, depending on whether one or two flu shots are given in the first eligible year, and on a few product- and age-specific factors that determine whether a child receives two or three HPV doses, three or four Hib doses, or two or three rotavirus doses. That’s a substantial increase in the number of shots, which is why some are alarmed by the idea of “too many, too soon.” But the science should offer worried parents a great deal of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an infectious diseases physician who directs an antibiotic stewardship program, I’m constantly weighing the benefits and risks of medical interventions — much like  parents weighing vaccine decisions for their children. And as a parent of two young kids myself, I understand why parents don’t want their children to receive anything that isn’t clearly indicated, and I share that commitment to evidence-based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, when parents ask me whether their kids are getting too many vaccines I take the question seriously and look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And those data reveal one of the most striking paradoxes in modern medicine, something that most people — including many health care providers — don’t know: Despite this significant increase in injections, today’s vaccines expose children to a fraction of the immune-stimulating material that previous generations encountered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand why, we need to know what antigens are. An antigen is any protein or molecule that your immune system recognizes as foreign. When you get a vaccine, the antigens in it teach your immune system to identify and fight specific diseases. Think of antigens as the “mug shots” your immune system uses to recognize threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hundred years ago, children received exactly one vaccine: smallpox. That single shot contained approximately 200 different antigens. Today’s &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; pediatric schedule exposes a child to about 165 — a fraction of the more than 3,200 in a single 1980s pertussis shot.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 1986, children received vaccines protecting against seven diseases. Those vaccines exposed them to over 3,200 antigens — mostly from a single shot of whole-cell DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) that contained roughly every protein the pertussis bacterium could produce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s expanded schedule protects against 16-18 diseases, but the total antigen count is about 165. That’s about a 95% reduction in antigen exposure, thanks to precision engineering that strips vaccines down to only the components necessary for protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t theoretical. Vaccine expert Paul Offit and colleagues &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11773551/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calculated&lt;/a&gt; that a baby could theoretically respond to 10,000 vaccines simultaneously before using even one percent of circulating B-cells. The real-world schedule barely registers on the immune system’s capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 1986, we’ve added vaccines against diseases that were killing and disabling thousands of children annually. Hib was the &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;leading cause of meningitis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7336a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;severe bloodstream infections&lt;/a&gt; in infants. After conjugate vaccines were introduced for all infants in 1990, the disease was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7336a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;virtually eliminated&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. Hepatitis B vaccination began in 1991 and has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/evidence-to-recommendations/hepb-adults-etr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly eradicated childhood liver infections&lt;/a&gt; that can lead to cancer decades later. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines introduced in 2000 &lt;a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.laneproxy.stanford.edu/book/9780323790581/plotkins-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;slashed rates of bloodstream infections and pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; in toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that vaccinating children born from 1994 through 2023 will prevent approximately 508 million illnesses, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1.13 million deaths, resulting in $540 billion in direct savings and $2.7 trillion in societal costs. Each additional vaccine underwent rigorous testing and addressed a real public health need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some who believe in the “too many, too soon” canard might say that the problem isn’t the antigens but the aluminum. But that fear is unfounded, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts have enhanced vaccine effectiveness since the 1930s, with doses tightly regulated by the FDA at no more than 0.85 mg per shot. In 1986, children received a total of about &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1.5 mg of aluminum&lt;/a&gt; through their first six months from vaccines (the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine). Today, they &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;receive&lt;/a&gt; approximately 4.4 mg by 6 months and about 6 mg by age 2 — a modest increase over nearly 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, formula-fed infants ingest about &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;38 mg of aluminum&lt;/a&gt; in their first six months, though only about 1% is absorbed. Furthermore, well over half the aluminum from vaccines clears through healthy kidneys within days, more than 70% by two weeks, with the remainder eliminated over months in people with normal kidney function. While it’s true that aluminum from vaccines enters the bloodstream more directly than aluminum from food (most of which is not absorbed), the body &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1935034952674099481" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;processes it the same way&lt;/a&gt;. Once in the blood, aluminum binds to proteins like transferrin and is filtered by the kidneys, regardless of how it entered. Reassuringly, studies show that routine vaccination does not increase total blood aluminum levels, and total lifetime exposure from vaccines remains far lower than from diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many newer vaccines contain zero aluminum: rotavirus, chickenpox, meningococcal conjugates, annual influenza, and mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, as well as RSV prevention shots, which are not technically vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mismatch between perception and reality isn’t surprising. Going from about a dozen shots to over 50 feels overwhelming. Parents experiene more office visits and naturally assume a greater biological burden. Of course, some parents’ hesitation isn’t rooted in politics or science. It’s the emotional weight of watching their children cry, or their own fear of needles. Those feelings are entirely human. But knowing what today’s vaccines actually contain — and what they prevent — can help put that discomfort in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical training doesn’t help. Most physicians learn about vaccine schedules but not the underlying immunology. We’re taught to recommend vaccines, not to explain why a 1980s pertussis shot contained about 20 times more antigens than today’s entire schedule.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The public health community bears responsibility, too. We’ve focused on vaccine safety and effectiveness — both crucial — while neglecting to communicate the engineering advances that make modern vaccines so precise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution isn’t to dismiss parental concerns but to arm families with actual data. The CDC lists vaccine ingredients online, but this information is often technical or not prominently displayed, making it hard for most parents to easily access or understand. Putting plain-language antigen and aluminum content directly on vaccine information sheets would cost little and build trust through transparency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Innovation continues. Researchers are developing adjuvants using saponins, synthetic molecules, and emulsions that could eliminate aluminum entirely while maintaining vaccine effectiveness. Combination vaccines already reduce both needle sticks and total adjuvant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The numbers tell a remarkable story. Children today receive roughly four to five times as many shots as their 1986 counterparts, yet are exposed to 95% fewer antigens and only modest increases in aluminum. We’ve achieved far more protection with far less immune burden through decades of scientific precision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a medical success story; it’s a lesson in how perception can diverge from reality. When parents see more visits and more needles, their instinct to worry is natural and understandable. But when we look at what actually matters to the immune system — the biological load, not the injection count — the data are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an era when medical misinformation spreads faster than the diseases vaccines prevent, transparency has become our most powerful tool. Show people that a single 1980s pertussis shot contained more antigens than today’s entire schedule, and watch skepticism transform into understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

Research suggested that regular use of certain types of commonly-prescribed drugs used to treat bladder conditions, Parkinson's disease and depression, could significantly increase the risk of dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by experts from the University of Nottingham and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), found that there was nearly a 50% increased risk of dementia among patients aged 55 and over who had used strong anticholinergic medication daily for three years or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Society, when the study came out, commented: "Our own researchers have already shown a strong link between anticholinergic drugs and risk of dementia. This study builds on this information, showing that long-term, high-dose use increases risk of some dementias, particularly vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A shortcoming of this type of study is that from this information we can't rule out whether the diseases that cause dementia might have already begun in the brains of people involved before they started taking these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Current guidelines for doctors say that anticholinergic drugs should be avoided for frail older people because of their impact on memory and thinking, but doctors should consider these new findings for all middle aged and older people as long-term use could raise the risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anticholinergic medications aid in the contraction and relaxation of muscles. They function by inhibiting acetylcholine, a chemical that transmits messages within the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These drugs are prescribed by doctors to treat a range of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bladder issues, allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These medicines can have short-term side effects, such as confusion and memory loss, but it is less clear whether long-term use increases the risk of dementia. The research, led by Professor Carol Coupland from the University's Division of Primary Care and published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, examined the medical records of 58,769 patients diagnosed with dementia and 225,574 patients without a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All patients were aged 55 and over and registered with UK GPs contributing data to the QResearch database, between 1 January 2004 and 31 January 2016. This study was first reported on in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings of the study indicated increased risks of dementia for anticholinergic drugs overall and specifically for the anticholinergic antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, antiparkinsons drugs, bladder drugs and epilepsy drugs after accounting for other risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No increased risks were found for the other types of anticholinergic drug studied such as antihistamines and gastrointestinal drugs. This study provides further evidence that doctors should be careful when prescribing certain drugs that have anticholinergic properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it's important that patients taking medications of this kind don't just stop them abruptly as this may be much more harmful. If patients have concerns, then they should discuss them with their doctor to consider the pros and cons of the treatment they are receiving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Professor Tom Dening, Head of the Centre for Dementia at the University of Nottingham and a member of the research study teamThe 58,769 patients with dementia had an average age of 82 and 63% were women. Each dementia case was matched to five control patients of the same age, sex, and general practice.Professor Coupland said: "Our study adds further evidence of the potential risks associated with strong anticholinergic drugs, particularly antidepressants, bladder antimuscarinic drugs, anti-Parkinson drugs and epilepsy drugs. " "The risks of this type of medication should be carefully considered by healthcare professionals alongside the benefits when the drugs are prescribed and alternative treatments should be considered where possible, such as other types of antidepressants or alternative types of treatment for bladder conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings also highlight the importance of carrying out regular medication reviews. We found a greater risk for people diagnosed with dementia before the age of 80 which indicates that anticholinergic drugs should be prescribed with caution in middle-aged people as well as in older people."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Society: The six most common symptoms of dementia include: &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory loss&lt;/b&gt; – problems recalling things that happened recently &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Difficulty organising thoughts&lt;/b&gt; – struggling to make decisions, solve problems or follow steps &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problems with communication&lt;/b&gt; – difficulties following conversations or struggling to find the right words &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problems with vision&lt;/b&gt; – problems judging distances or perceiving object edges &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting confused about time or place&lt;/b&gt; – losing track of the time or date, or becoming confused about where they are &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes in mood or personality –&lt;/b&gt; becoming unusually anxious, irritable, or withdrawn &lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re worried about yourself, or someone close to you, then check your symptoms today.

Now we should recommend a baby aspirin." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An earlier study led by Prof Burn found &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/new-draft-guidance-says-aspirin-taken-daily-could-reduce-risk-of-bowel-cancer-for-people-with-lynch-syndrome/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a protective effect in those taking 600mg of aspirin every day for just over two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said the new results showed the lowest dose worked just as well as the larger doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"So what we can now say with statistical confidence is that the people taking a baby aspirin are as protected as the people taking two aspirins - but also much less likely to have side effects," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Professor of Clinical Genetics at Newcastle University, Sir John Burn, led the research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In some people, aspirin can cause bleeding, so Prof Burn said he wanted health regulators to now recommend the lowest dose be given to Lynch syndrome patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Roughly speaking, if someone with Lynch syndrome has about a 2% a year chance of getting mostly bowel cancers, we think if they take aspirin, that is halved - down to about 1% a year," he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Burn said the next big challenge was to find those who were unaware they even have Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said "about 150,000 patients in the UK" have the condition, but a small number are only tested when they realise cancer runs in their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was only when they get cancer in their 40s and 50s, and remember their auntie had cancer, and their granddad." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Aspirin can cause bleeding in some people&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NHS England said with only 5-10% of patients diagnosed, identifying more people with Lynch syndrome was a strategic priority. Once diagnosed, they can then be offered cancer screening and monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Burn said: "We can also put them on to a baby aspirin - and cut their risk."     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings of the study will be presented at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/research-events-and-conferences/the-cancer-prevention-research-conference" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Cancer Prevention Research Conference&lt;/a&gt;, taking place in London from Wednesday, in partnership with the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 05:03:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBjdnpJeC1DTElmbkpmeHFzTm5TSEQxY1VsTW8zSkhvd1JBQzJjbnF0c0dpazE4b05vMzRFTldZT2JhWUx6S0RJXzJEU01laVNweVBiTkwzM093d9IBX0FVX3lxTFB0N3pWTWpWSFEtU2lrMTNJek4wc0VXZnItLTRhOHRBSVNwOG1VOXNKTFBrdnV0TENXVGxRTzFCb1NROVN2Ui1OanU3OXJRYzYwNEZvaXFmY1c1TWZhQ01v</guid></item><item><title>根据科学家的说法，你如何定位你的手臂可以改变血压读数- Earth.com | How you position your arm can alter blood pressure readings, according to scientists - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQUjhvY3NGUnI4TW1fVmNQZm5XV3ptdXBGNlFVc2ctMDFOZUdCSmpMLXdFYzdLY2xiUXBsdExaWWZlQXdNa1BxZ094Qmh5dFhOd0had3BvWjVaYVRjLVFuQXpDSzVRTGV4dDRtRWxxNlhGcVEtTUZwSDRLUUpqakhFZWpkeE9jRHQ1YkNSbVR2ekdVZUpidmk2dlVBQWFWWFJlRm96WmZZT3N4UFBxbl9UcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure drives heart attacks and strokes, yet the routine test that spots it can be surprisingly fragile. Two inches of arm drift are enough to nudge the reading into the danger zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crossover trial at Johns Hopkins now shows that a patient who lets an arm dangle may appear up to 7 millimeters of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/basic-information-about-mercury" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; higher than one whose arm rests on the exam‑room desk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That difference can tip a person’s blood pressure reading from “elevated” into dangerous “stage 2” territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/tammy-mc-loughlin-brady/2704889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tammy Brady&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, of the &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, led the investigation that re‑created three real‑world postures seen in clinics every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-designed"&gt;How the study was designed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mimic real checkup conditions, researchers asked each participant to walk for two minutes before every blood pressure reading. Then they rested for five minutes in a quiet room, seated with back and feet supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person went through four rounds of triplicate measurements using different arm positions. By repeating the desk-supported reading at the end, the team accounted for natural blood pressure shifts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-blood-pressure-can-fool-us"&gt;Why blood pressure can fool us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of U.S. adults live with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, the persistent elevation of arterial pressure that strains the heart and vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians rely on a single snapshot often taken in less than a minute, to decide whether to start lifelong medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 133 Baltimore volunteers aged 18 to 80 and rotated them through desk‑support, lap‑rest, and side‑dangling positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used automated cuffs to remove observer bias and repeated the desk posture at the end to control for natural fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the desk standard, a lap‑supported arm averaged 3.9 mmHg higher &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/systolic-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic&lt;/a&gt; and 4 mmHg higher &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-look-at-diastolic-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diastolic&lt;/a&gt;. An unsupported arm reached 6.5 mmHg and 4.4 mmHg above the baseline for those same numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-trial-uncovered"&gt;What the trial uncovered&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fast-paced clinics, staff may skip best practices without realizing the consequences. It’s common to see rushed exams where patients hold their own arms or sit on exam tables without support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shortcuts might seem minor in the moment, but repeated over time, they add up. Misreadings can creep into charts, shape diagnoses, and affect treatment plans that last for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are consistently measuring blood pressure with an unsupported arm, and that gives you an overestimated BP of 6.5 mmHg, that’s a potential difference between a systolic BP of 123 and 130,” warned &lt;a href="https://globalhypertensionathopkins.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sherry Liu, M.H.S.&lt;/a&gt;, referencing the clinical jump from “elevated” to “stage 1”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern held in younger and older adults, in people with and without &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-childhood-obesity-rate-is-expected-to-soar-by-2050/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, and in those already diagnosed with high pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-properly-take-blood-pressure"&gt;How to properly take blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desk‑level support keeps the cuff’s mid‑point at mid‑heart height, equalizing hydrostatic pressure along the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the arm, and gravity demands a higher force to push blood upward, so the gauge records extra pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/11/09/where-and-how-you-sit-matters-when-getting-blood-pressure-taken-at-the-doctors-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; instructs nurses to seat patients in a backed chair, feet flat, legs uncrossed, and arm resting on a firm surface that aligns with the right atrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even well-trained clinicians don’t always follow textbook guidelines. In busy offices, there’s pressure to move quickly, and details like arm height can get overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some providers might think close is good enough, but the research shows that “almost right” still leads to wrong numbers. Unless someone checks posture intentionally, errors can become routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-home-monitors-need-help"&gt;At‑home monitors need help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions measure at home, yet many kitchen tables are too low to mimic clinic desks. A pillow under the elbow or sliding the device onto a higher counter can close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuff size matters as well; sleeves that are too narrow can push readings 5 to 10 mmHg higher, a problem affecting about 12 percent of Black Americans with larger &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.124.23473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arm circumferences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-technique-leads-to-misdiagnosis"&gt;Poor technique leads to misdiagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small inaccuracies in readings can have a big impact on a person’s health journey. An overestimated result could lead to an incorrect &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-blood-pressure-can-be-detected-in-voice-recordings/"&gt;hypertension diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, prompting unnecessary prescriptions or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a reading that seems only slightly elevated might prevent someone from getting the treatment they actually need. Proper positioning is not just about data quality – it can change real-life decisions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady’s team plans to test whether a simple reminder on the device screen: “Rest arm on table” nudges behavior in primary‑care offices. They also want to see whether the error shrinks with wrist cuffs that use built‑in position sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health specialists hope standard positioning can prevent thousands of unnecessary prescriptions each year, reducing side effects and costs without compromising cardiovascular safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2824754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 02:50:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQUjhvY3NGUnI4TW1fVmNQZm5XV3ptdXBGNlFVc2ctMDFOZUdCSmpMLXdFYzdLY2xiUXBsdExaWWZlQXdNa1BxZ094Qmh5dFhOd0had3BvWjVaYVRjLVFuQXpDSzVRTGV4dDRtRWxxNlhGcVEtTUZwSDRLUUpqakhFZWpkeE9jRHQ1YkNSbVR2ekdVZUpidmk2dlVBQWFWWFJlRm96WmZZT3N4UFBxbl9UcQ</guid></item><item><title>致命的“法老诅咒”真菌可能是战胜癌症的关键-印度时报 | Deadly ‘Pharaoh’s Curse’ Fungus may hold key to beating cancer - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an ancient curse holding the key to a much-coveted cure!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tutankhamun’s tomb was cracked open in 1922, the world was mesmerized and somewhat terrified. Tales of the “Pharaoh’s Curse” swiftly followed: mysterious illnesses, sudden deaths, and a malevolent ancient hex. But modern science has unearthed a far more compelling explanation: a deadly fungus lurking in those sealed chambers, not dark magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The lurking menace:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi like Aspergillus flavus, which thrive in hermetically sealed, humid environments, were dormant in King Tut’s tomb for centuries. Once the tomb was opened, spores could disperse into the air, triggering respiratory infections, particularly in vulnerable individuals. Indeed, researchers hypothesize that Lord Carnarvon’s pneumonia and death may have been tied to invasive aspergillosis acquired shortly after exposure to these ancient molds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what began as a harrowing cautionary tale has now become a beacon of hope. That very fungal kingdom, once an incidental actor in macabre legends, is now a treasure trove for anticancer compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania has discovered that the same notorious fungus, Aspergillus flavus (the "pharaoh's curse fungus"), may hold the key to fighting cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the new discovery say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its dark history, the recent research, published recently in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-025-01946-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Chemical Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, reveals that the fungus, Aspergillus flavus, contains a special compound capable of targeting cancer cells – a promising breakthrough in the realm of cancer treatment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team isolated a new group of molecules from this fascinating fungus and, after modifying them, tested their effects on leukaemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their surprise, they found some remarkable results. By exploring various strains of Aspergillus flavus, they uncovered that some might contain even more of these powerful compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They managed to purify four different peptides, known as ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), which they named asperigimycins. These compounds demonstrated impressive potential against leukaemia cells, even without any modifications. It turns out that asperigimycins work by disrupting the way cancer cells divide – an exciting mechanism that could lead to new treatments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Sherry Gao, a key researcher and Associate Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, "Fungi gave us penicillin, and these results show that there are still many more medicines to discover from nature." Dr. Gao added that these compounds block the formation of microtubules, which are crucial for cell division, thus halting the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From mythological curse to medicinal cure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey of the Pharaoh’s Curse fungus – from deathly spores haunting tombs to life-saving cancer therapies – is nothing short of extraordinary. What began as superstitious fear has, through the lens of science, come full circle to become a source of healing. The narrative arc – from the “Pharaoh’s Curse” mythos to molecular oncology – highlights humanity’s evolving relationship with the natural world. It reminds us that nature’s mysteries, even the ominous ones, can inspire medical miracles.

Making even small tweaks to the proteins that make up the shell stopped the virus from replicating as quickly, which suggested that drugs that affect the protein shell could prove to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was these insights that caught the attention of Gilead Sciences, prompting the company to search for drugs that target HIV's protein shell — otherwise known as a capsid — tapping Sundquist as a consultant and eventually leading to the development of lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug itself binds the viral protein shell of HIV, preventing it from assembling properly and productively entering the nucleus of host cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more potent than any drug available, but more importantly, it's very long-lasting. So what the Phase 3 clinical trials show is that it completely protects people from transmission for six months," Sundquist said. "There are still 1.3 million new infections worldwide, and this could really change that trajectory. Of course, the rollout has to be funded and be successful, but right now there's no reason to think this won't have a major impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other HIV drugs, lenacapavir is noteworthy due to its potential for preventing HIV entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, about 40 million people live with HIV and the virus is responsible for 600,000 deaths annually, according to data from the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gileads-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-demonstrated-100-efficacy-and-superiority-to-daily-truvada-for-hiv-prevention" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;large clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa and Uganda — two HIV hot spots — not one of the more than 2,000 women who received a dose of lenacapavir contracted HIV over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lenacapavir almost completely prevents the transmission of HIV into at-risk populations," Sundquist said. "This is just an amazing result."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approving the drug is just another notch in Sundquist's belt, as he was also &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/2025-warren-alpert-prize-honors-scientists-whose-discoveries-culminated-novel-hiv-treatment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; the 2025 Warren Alpert Prize from Harvard University last week. In April, Sundquist was named as one of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51296173" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Time magazine's&lt;/a&gt; 100 most influential people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view ourselves as sort of the feedstock for new ways of approaching medicine," Sundquist said. "We're driven by curiosity to discover things that we don't understand. And I think that's not so different from other kinds of adventurers. The same thing that drives people to discover or climb mountains, I think, drives us to discover how a molecular machine works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the recent success, Sundquist remains driven, saying the work on HIV is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still need a vaccine. That would be even better because then you could give everyone the vaccine and protect everyone, not just at-risk individuals," Sundquist said. "That's been a very difficult problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

By recording activity in tens of thousands of neurons, scientists found that the visual cortex builds internal models of the environment, preparing the brain for future tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unsupervised learning occurs without any instruction, helping animals learn goal-oriented tasks faster later on. The study highlights how both unsupervised and supervised learning operate in parallel within the brain, reshaping our understanding of how we acquire knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain encodes environmental features even without tasks, aiding future learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Cortex Roles:&lt;/strong&gt; Distinct regions of the visual cortex handle exploratory (unsupervised) and task-based (supervised) learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster Task Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice exposed to unstructured environments learned reward-linked tasks more quickly than unexposed peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;HHMI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aimlessly wandering around a city or exploring the new mall may seem unproductive, but new research from HHMI’s Janelia Research Campus suggests it could play an important role in how our brains learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simultaneously recording the activity of tens of thousands of neurons, a team of scientists from the Pachitariu and Stringer labs discovered that learning may occur even when there are no specific tasks or goals involved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research finds that as animals explore their environment, neurons in the visual cortex—the brain area responsible for processing visual information—encode visual features to build an internal model of the world. This information can speed up learning when a more concrete task arises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even when you are zoning out or just walking around or you don’t think you are doing anything special or hard, your brain is probably still working hard to help you memorize where you are, organizing the world around you, so that when you’re not zoning out anymore—when you actually need to do something and pay attention—you’re ready to do your best,” says Janelia Group Leader Marius Pachitariu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observing unsupervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team, led by postdoc Lin Zhong, designed experiments where mice ran in linear virtual reality corridors featuring various visual textures, akin to real-world environments. Some textures were linked to rewards, while others were not. After the mice learned the rules of an experiment, Zhong made subtle adjustments, altering the textures and the presence of rewards.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weeks of running these experiments, the team observed changes in neural activity within the animals’ visual cortex. However, they struggled to explain the observed neural plasticity—the changes in connections between neurons that enable learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we thought more and more about it, we eventually ended up on the question of whether the task itself was even necessary,” Pachitariu says. “It’s entirely possible that a lot of the plasticity happens just basically with the animal’s own exploration of the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers explicitly tested this concept of unsupervised learning, they discovered that certain areas of the visual cortex were encoding visual features even without the animal being trained on a task. When a task was introduced, other areas of the cortex responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the researchers found that mice exploring the virtual corridor for several weeks learned how to associate textures with rewards much faster than mice trained only on the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It means that you don’t always need a teacher to teach you: You can still learn about your environment unconsciously, and this kind of learning can prepare you for the future,” Zhong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was very surprised. I have been doing behavioral experiments since my PhD, and I never expected that without training mice to do a task, you will find the same neuroplasticity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding how brains learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings reveal distinct areas in the visual cortex are responsible for different types of learning: unstructured, exploration-based unsupervised learning and instructed, goal-oriented supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests that when animals learn a task, the brain might simultaneously use both algorithms—an unsupervised component to extract features and a supervised component to assign meaning to those features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights could enhance our understanding of how learning occurs in the brain. While previous research on the visual cortex focused mainly on supervised learning, the new work opens new avenues for exploration, including how these different types of learning interact and how the visual model of the environment is integrated with spatial models from other brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a door to studying these unsupervised learning algorithms in the brain, and if that’s the main way by which the brain learns, as opposed to a more instructed, goal-directed way, then we need to study that part as well,” Pachitariu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say these insights were enabled both by Janelia’s support teams, which helped the researchers design and run the experiments, and by the mesoscope, an instrument that enabled the team to record up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously, enhancing their ability to make new discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Allowing a single lab to run projects at this scale is what is uniquely possible here and that gives us the flexibility to pursue different questions without necessarily having a concrete plan,” Pachitariu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bddfd2d0cdd8c4d3fdd5d5d0d493d2cfda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nanci Bompey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://hhmi.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HHMI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Nanci Bompey – HHMI&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09180-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Unsupervised pretraining in biological neural networks&lt;/a&gt;” by Marius Pachitariu et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsupervised pretraining in biological neural networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the availability of instruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the sensory cortex, perceptual learning drives neural plasticity, but it is not known whether this is due to supervised or unsupervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we recorded populations of up to 90,000 neurons simultaneously from the primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVAs) while mice learned multiple tasks, as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to previous studies, we found that neural changes in task mice were correlated with their behavioural learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the neural changes were mostly replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to unsupervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neural plasticity was highest in the medial HVAs and obeyed visual, rather than spatial, learning rules. In task mice only, we found a ramping reward-prediction signal in anterior HVAs, potentially involved in supervised learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our neural results predict that unsupervised learning may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction that we validated with behavioural experiments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 21:26:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFB5bGY5NE8xdWFhMzBFY2xsSlJZR21JbkR4LXdHX2dGbENvZl8wdEFCUkI0bE9qRzJqb0lxbS00YnN1RWFhUk53dlJNbzdkMjBSZERNX0dWOFZvQ0FFbTdjbmhrZjJZUGtxN0lJS202blZYb3NoeVYw</guid></item><item><title>Oura Ring现在可以使用人工智能来监测血糖水平。我测试了一周，并得到了这3个令人惊讶的收获- CNET | Oura Ring Can Now Use AI to Monitor Blood Sugar Levels.

I'm constantly experimenting with the latest health tech, so I was naturally intrigued when I learned that Oura Ring partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/in-2024-biosensors-are-becoming-more-accessible-what-it-means-for-you/" target="_self"&gt;Dexcom's Stelo,&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/best-continuous-glucose-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt; designed for people without diabetes. The goal of this collaboration is to help everyday people like me understand how food and general eating habits &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/what-can-your-blood-sugar-tell-you-i-tracked-mine-for-a-month-to-find-out/" target="_self"&gt;impact blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and overall health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;"By combining Stelo data with Oura's existing insights, we're empowering members to better understand the cause-and-effect relationships between eating patterns, energy, mood and recovery -- and ultimately make sustainable, science-backed lifestyle changes," Maz Brumand, vice president of product for Oura, told CNET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tested the Stelo CGM with my Oura Ring for two weeks, and I can say that it changed the way I eat and move, and I think this type of biofeedback is helpful for everyone, even if you do not have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is continuous glucose monitoring, and why is it important?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood sugar, or blood glucose, refers to the measurement of sugar in your blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/23509-glycogen" target="_self"&gt;glucose is the main source of energy&lt;/a&gt; for your body -- it's what powers your muscles, brain and even your cells. When you eat certain foods (particularly carbohydrates), your glucose rises, and your body responds by releasing insulin to shuttle that sugar into cells for energy or storage. On the flip side, if you experience frequent spikes or crashes (even if you don't have diabetes ), it can impact your energy, sleep, mood and even long-term metabolic health. When your body doesn't need glucose immediately, it &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK539802/" target="_self"&gt;stores it as glycogen&lt;/a&gt; in your muscles and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with diabetes, monitoring glucose levels is crucial. But is it important to do the same for the rest of us without a diagnosis? To an extent, I think so. Monitoring your blood sugar throughout the day and seeing how your body reacts to different foods can reveal a lot about your cravings, sleep and metabolic health. "Glucose is a real-time window into metabolic health, which underpins how we feel day to day -- our energy, focus, mood and sleep -- and how resilient we are over time," Brumand says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rise of wearable glucose sensors like Stelo, those without diabetes can now get insights into how their eating habits impact their bodies (without finger pricks or a prescription).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is a 'normal' glucose range, and are spikes bad?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using a CGM, I thought blood sugar was either stable or erratic, with no room for in-between spikes. Once I began tracking my glucose daily, I quickly learned that spikes are completely normal, especially after meals and snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people will see glucose levels rise and drop throughout the day. According to the &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;American Diabetes Association&lt;/a&gt;, a general target range for adults without pre-diabetes or diabetes is between &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/diagnosis" target="_self"&gt;70 and 140mg/dL&lt;/a&gt; (note that Oura also follows this range, and it's what users can expect to see in their graphs). It's also worth highlighting that 70 to 100mg/dL is considered normal for fasting (particularly in the morning before having food), and under 140 mg/dL is common, especially after meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinical studies show that even in healthy individuals, a moderate glucose spike (rise above 140mg/dL) can occur on a daily basis. In fact, research suggests that healthy adults will live above 140mg/dL for about 30 minutes, up to 2 hours a day, which is usually 1 to 3 short-lived glucose spikes", says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneefitton" target="_self"&gt;Renee Fitton&lt;/a&gt;, registered dietitian and director of education at &lt;a href="https://theorg.com/org/l-nutra/org-chart/renee-fitton-ms-rd" target="_self"&gt;L-Nutra&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition technology company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Oura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that the number and frequency of glucose spikes depend on various factors, primarily what and when you're eating. These spiked can also be affected by other factors like stress level, exercise, dehydration and even whether you have a sunburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many glucose monitors use a custom range that adapts to your body's baseline and patterns over time. When looking at your graph, it's important to keep in mind that context and trends matter more than one-off spikes. For example, seeing a spike after dessert isn't a sign that something is wrong. It's a sign that your body is doing its job. What matters most is how quickly your glucose returns to baseline and how often your levels stay elevated over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would not see signs for concern for occasional (one to three times per day) moderate spikes (less than 160mg/dL) that resolve within about 30 mins. When reaching more frequent, especially if they are higher spikes (for example, above 180mg/dL), that take a long time to resolve (over 60 minutes), then there may be concerns about metabolic health," Fitton explained. "A completely flat glucose curve is not something that we aim for; you want some gentle ups and downs as a sign of healthy metabolic flexibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How I set up the Stelo monitor with my Oura Ring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can order the Stelo sensor through &lt;a href="http://ouraring.com" target="_self"&gt;ouraring.com&lt;/a&gt; ($99 for two sensors). I received a small box with the sensors and easy instructions. Applying it to the back of my upper arm took less than 2 minutes and was surprisingly painless. And yes, there is a small needle involved. I'm terrified of needles, so I spent some time mentally preparing to prick myself, but to my disbelief, I didn't feel it at all. The sound the ejector makes is pretty loud, though. I sometimes think the sound acted as a diversion to my brain, and that's why I didn't feel anything. But, nonetheless, it was a pretty pain-free experience. Once in place, I paired it to the Stelo app, and it automatically reflected within the Oura app. Each sensor tracks your glucose level 24/7 for up to 15 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left Image: CGM in the self-injector.

You can easily access it at the top of the app, where you also see other data metrics like sleep, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/best-chest-strap-heart-rate-monitors/" target="_self"&gt;heart rate&lt;/a&gt;, activity and readiness score (a personalized score, ranging from 0 to 100, that provides a snapshot of how well your body has recovered from the previous day's activities and sleep).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How even my 'healthy' food choices raised my blood sugar (and that's OK)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most eye-opening parts of my testing was seeing how some of my favorite healthy staples played out on the glucose graph. A great example of this was my favorite pressed juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a pressed juice in the morning that contained pineapple, beets, carrots, ginger, cucumber and lemon. It's nutrient-dense, but it also spiked my glucose above what's considered my healthy range for about 6  minutes (a small window and still considered optimal for my age and overall metabolic health). This was enough to make me rethink how and when I consume fruit-heavy beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I experimented with having a fruit smoothie instead of juice. I made a homemade smoothie with berries, banana, plant-based protein powder, peanut butter, soy milk and oats. This smoothie kept my glucose completely in range (zero minutes above my personal threshold). The added protein and fiber from the fruit, oatmeal, peanut butter and protein powder helped slow the absorption of natural sugars into my bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I learned: Even natural fruit juices can cause glucose spikes, especially when consumed on an empty stomach and without any protein or fiber. Smoothies that include protein, fat and fiber can help keep spikes at bay and help stabilize your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Balance your meals with protein, fats and fiber &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that week, I had sushi rolls with a side of edamame for dinner. To my surprise, my glucose levels stayed within range the whole time. Oura Advisor (Oura's AI coach) even pointed out that this food combination offered protein and fiber, which likely contributed to the steady glucose levels. This moment was really encouraging for me. It made me realize that I don't need to drastically change what I eat. By just being more intentional about how I pair my foods, I can drastically improve the impact they have on my blood glucose. Pairing your foods with healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil can also slow digestion and therefore the absorption of sugars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton explains that this is primarily due to what happens in our digestive tract, even before the nutrients get to our bloodstream. Protein, fiber and healthy fats work in their own way to slow the absorption of simple carbohydrates into the bloodstream, making a slower, more gradual release of sugars into the blood. These factors turn what could be a glucose spike into a steady rise that your body can clear gradually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest area of concern when managing our blood sugar levels is limiting refined carbohydrates. When you do choose a refined-carb item (a plain cracker, white flour tortilla, cookies, etc.), try to pair it instead of eating it solo: add cheese, nut butter or a handful of edamame to blunt the glucose rise, and choose a higher-fiber version of your carbohydrate source when possible (for example, whole-grain crackers) so the carbs come packaged with their own speed limit," Fitton says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cake and a walk equal steady blood sugar?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the more surprising things I learned was that blood sugar stability isn't just about what you eat. It's also about what you do after you eat. One afternoon, I had a slice of cake for a snack. No fiber or protein added, just the cake (I had lunch a few hours before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of my blood sugar spiking, my glucose levels remained steadily in range. The caveat? I took a brisk walk after having my dessert. It wasn't anything strenuous, just a short 15-minute walk around my neighborhood. But it was enough to help my body process and use the glucose more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The body knows that exercise demands more energy, and so it helps open up our cells to soak up sugar (energy) and remove it from our blood. A 10-minute walk burns about 30 to 40 calories, and your body will get that energy from circulating glucose or stored glycogen," Fitton explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After eating cake and going for a walk, my blood sugar saw a slight spike, but stayed within range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Nasha Addarich Martínez/CNET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/blog/walking-after-eating" target="_self"&gt;walk after meals&lt;/a&gt; has long been recommended by experts for metabolic health, but seeing the effect in real time made it click for me. I do think that having the cake after having a balanced meal with protein and fiber also contributed to my steady levels of blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it's not about completely eliminating our favorite treats or carbs, but more so about timing, food pairing and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3 ways I learned to flatten my glucose curve without sacrificing my favorite meals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before using the glucose sensor with Oura, I assumed blood sugar spikes were mostly about foods and how they impact your body. I also thought the only way to manage them was to cut carbs or drastically change my diet. But over these two weeks, I experienced firsthand how and when I eat (and move) matter just as much as what I eat. I learned that these three strategies helped keep my glucose levels in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pair carbs and sweets with protein, fiber and healthy fats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had a berry smoothie with protein powder and soy milk, my glucose levels stayed steady. In contrast, when I had a fruit smoothie earlier that week, my blood sugar levels spiked and crashed more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt; Carbs on their own, especially refined and processed carbs, can spike blood sugar quickly, but adding protein or fat slows digestion and leads to a more gentle spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food pairing examples: &lt;/strong&gt;Apples and peanut butter, toast with avocado, rice with beans or another protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Daniela Duncan/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Walk it out (especially after sweets)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I had cake as a snack, I was sure my graph would spike dramatically, but it didn't because of my walk (and eating a balanced meal before).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple walk, even just 10 to 15 minutes, can help offset blood sugar spikes. This small but simple habit helps me now enjoy treats without the crash later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Timing your food matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that when I ate higher-carb foods earlier in the day, my body processed them better than when I had them later at night. Breakfast smoothies and bowls kept my levels stable, while the same smoothie after 9 p.m. caused more spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it comes to blood sugar management, we see that in the morning our body usually has a spike in cortisol (a stress hormone) that can actually help our body take up sugar very quickly and quickly manage blood sugar. Eating in the morning will also calm the cortisol response, reducing the stress on your body. If you wait too long to eat, excess cortisol can create inflammation and also produce larger glucose spikes when you do eat," explained Fitton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitton further explained that, conversely, in the evening, the sugar management systems in our bodies start powering down and are not as good at helping blood sugar get into the cells. So it is important to try not to eat too late; otherwise, you'll probably see blood sugar go up and stay up for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean you can't eat carbs or treats at night, but eating them earlier in the day when insulin sensitivity tends to be higher can make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 21:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTFBYVGJ6WlBIZ2FYLUJuQmc5OVhHVVBnalVabnVsc1JhLWp1d3NpWjRvVzRZSUpfM1lBMk1INmk2VmZtSEtCZkFYWFkxM1F3ekJDMnVNVjJhTlZObzNJeFNnS29JOEJPRWI0WjJ2QVpmUVIzZnI2S0E</guid></item><item><title>科学家已经确切地计算出饮酒会减少多少时间- AOL.com | Scientists Have Figured Out Exactly How Much Time Drinking Takes Off Your Life - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE52M0dYeFROUnRmYWVQYUd6cXpaekphZjB2bjhyY1BjNE8zU2g3Ml9tUXNyaGdZMkVYRXNXbVhWS2ZUT1hFWnhuRnB3Qy1HOTRIMzRoUC1FaGUzTmFNS1Z2d2dlMVlfdFAteUlkUTFCVXUxcUhUSUcxMEJ0Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Can Drinking Alcohol Shorten Your Life?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Kesu01 - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, there's been a lot of talk about the &lt;a href="https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/a63384822/is-it-healthy-to-drink-alcohol-every-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:negative effects of drinking alcohol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;negative effects of drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt;. In December of last year, the U.S. Surgeon General released an &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/surgeongeneral/reports-and-publications/alcohol-cancer/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advisory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; warning about the direct relationship between alcohol consumption and cancer. Around the same time, new research challenged long-held beliefs about the safety of moderate drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.jsad.com/doi/10.15288/jsad.23-00283" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Tim Stockwell and colleagues found that even low levels of alcohol consumption are linked to increased mortality. Dr. Stockwell later estimated, in media interviews, how this risk might translate into days or years of life lost depending on drinking level. He told the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13605039/Exact-number-alcohol-shortens-life-expectancy.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that consuming just two drinks per week may shorten your life by three to six days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And unfortunately, for frequent imbibers, the numbers get even bleaker. According to Dr. Stockwell’s comments to the media, if a person were to drink seven alcoholic beverages a week (beer, wine, or spirits), they risk cutting their life expectancy by two and a half months. A person who drinks 35 alcoholic beverages a week could shorten their life by two years, based on his interpretation of the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Stockwell told the &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; that these numbers are averages, and some people could end up luckier than others. He discouraged people from considering alcohol as something that is okay or even healthy to consume in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; defines moderate drinking as one drink or less per day for women and two or less for men. For years, moderate drinking was considered okay, if not beneficial. However, Dr. Stockwell's research—and a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2802963" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2023 meta-analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2023 meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; he co-authored, which analyzed 107 studies from over 40 years—disputed that belief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dr. Stockwell’s review of years of research really challenges the old idea that a little alcohol is good for you. What he and his team found is that even small amounts of alcohol can shorten your lifespan," &lt;a href="https://sleepopolis.com/experts/dr-raj-dasgupta/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Raj Dasgupta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/a&gt;, Chief Medical Advisor for Sleepopolis tells &lt;em&gt;Delish&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Dasgupta explains that both how much you drink and how often you drink impacts life expectancy. And as drinking increases, he says there's a greater risk to long-term health, such as liver problems, cancer, heart disease, and accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alcohol’s effect on each person is different. My advice: if you do drink, try to keep it in moderation," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 20:43:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE52M0dYeFROUnRmYWVQYUd6cXpaekphZjB2bjhyY1BjNE8zU2g3Ml9tUXNyaGdZMkVYRXNXbVhWS2ZUT1hFWnhuRnB3Qy1HOTRIMzRoUC1FaGUzTmFNS1Z2d2dlMVlfdFAteUlkUTFCVXUxcUhUSUcxMEJ0Yw</guid></item><item><title>严重的床虱感染蔓延到Coolidge Corner公寓大楼- Brookline。新闻 | Severe bedbug infestation spreads through Coolidge Corner condo building - Brookline.News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOTUhqZDhyakhmRjA5V0FacTBoMFAxUlJzNkx5djFCQzBVNnFSTlNJWVdDcjF4M05vemwxdUxHZlF4ZkhyZEgwYW1UU1MzRW9MbElNb2FNUllsTmRaQ1J3eVZkLVU0dGdEWkdxbm40d2F6eXpoTERFZC1qSEJqcVR5dDhoV0JaVk56UHVPMFhsd0YyTUZMMi13ZVE0d0o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="nv-content-wrap entry-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A severe bedbug infestation in a condominium complex near Coolidge Corner has been festering for weeks, leaving residents frustrated and alarmed at the situation, and at the slow process of fixing the problem through the health department and the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 100,000 bedbugs are living in a condo in the Concorde Condominium complex at 50 Green St., and the infestation is so severe that the bedbugs have spread to at least eight of the other 59 units in the building, according to residents and court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One resident, whose condo now has bedbugs and asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, had a bite that became infected. The resident has since healed from the infection, but still has about 40 bites on his body, he told Brookline&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While bedbugs do not carry disease, cohabitating with them is less than ideal, the resident said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="mid-article-subscribe" class="do-not-print"&gt;&lt;div id="mid-article-subscribe-hdr"&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-h3"&gt;Get the latest Brookline news free in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="bdn-sub-inst"&gt;All fields required. You may unsubscribe at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just sleeping at night knowing you’re getting eaten alive is unsettling,” he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigalle Reiss, Brookline’s director of public health and human services, said the owner of the unit where the infestation began also suffers from hoarding disorder, worsening their living conditions and making it even more difficult to address the bedbugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person was named in court documents, but Brookline&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;News is not disclosing their identity to protect their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of factors makes this case “one of the worst” she’s seen in her 23 years of experience in local public health, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s difficult enough to treat bed bugs in normal situations. It’s even harder when there’s this amount of debris,” she said. “Until this is remediated it’s going to be a real struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concorde Condominiums residents filed their first complaint of bedbugs to the Brookline Public Health Department on April 30, Reiss said. The department investigated the unit on May 7, and it was later inspected by Dewey Pest and Wildlife, a pest control service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Conditions are best described as deplorable,” wrote an entomologist from the pest control service in an assessment of the unit. “Most inspectible surfaces and items in the unit have been heavily contaminated by bedbugs and their feces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entomologist also recommended that a disaster remediation service should be hired to clean and decontaminate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condo was deemed “unfit for human habitation” on May 12, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 14, the health department ordered the resident to vacate the unit, Reiss said. After that, the process transferred out of the health department’s hands and into the court’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the remediation process has moved at a much slower pace than residents would like — and now, more than a month later, the problem remains unresolved, residents say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were hoping the health department would clean it out … or help us out by enforcing their order of condemnation, which they have not done,” said the resident who had an infected bedbug bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really up to the condo association and their legal process to get the order enforced,” Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://brookline.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Order-on-PI-6.4.25.pdf"&gt;court order&lt;/a&gt; filed on June 4 required the resident with the severe bedbugs case to “clean and restore” the condo to liveable conditions and to hire an extermination service for the bedbugs by June 11. The resident did not abide by the court order by June 11, so the Condominium Trust may legally enter the condominium and take steps to clean and restore it, according to the court order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Plaintiffs intend to proceed in accordance with the terms of the Court’s Order, and to avail themselves to the rights and relief afforded thereunder, as may be necessary and appropriate, and to the extent authorized,” wrote Jennifer Barnett, an attorney representing the Concorde Condominiums Trustees, in a statement to Brookline&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The town’s attorneys are also in “close communications” with another attorney representing the Concorde Condominiums Trustees, Reiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Brookline.News</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 20:22:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOTUhqZDhyakhmRjA5V0FacTBoMFAxUlJzNkx5djFCQzBVNnFSTlNJWVdDcjF4M05vemwxdUxHZlF4ZkhyZEgwYW1UU1MzRW9MbElNb2FNUllsTmRaQ1J3eVZkLVU0dGdEWkdxbm40d2F6eXpoTERFZC1qSEJqcVR5dDhoV0JaVk56UHVPMFhsd0YyTUZMMi13ZVE0d0o</guid></item><item><title>睡眠的秘密序列可能会像花园一样塑造我们的记忆-神经科学新闻 | Sleep’s Secret Sequence May Sculpt Our Memories Like a Garden - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE5vTHkwTkluUjVHcGRrb2h6RXBZbkFPSTUydm8tNklIaS1aMzlXMnlSdkV4S1JCVzZiX3VkYUx3NFYyb3lSckFTOXBkSlpoYWpTN0tLYlowdWtfeXdrV3Z1MWpKYXpkQnVnQlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new theory suggests that the order of sleep phases—non-REM followed by REM—is essential for strengthening and organizing memories. In mouse studies and computational models, researchers found that non-REM sleep reinforces new memories, while REM sleep prunes overlapping or irrelevant ones, keeping them distinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversing this cycle causes memory degradation, highlighting why the natural progression of sleep stages is so evolutionarily conserved. While more research is needed, the findings offer a compelling explanation for how sleep architecture supports learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Gardening:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-REM sleep grows and stabilizes memories; REM trims overlapping ones to keep them distinct.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Reversing the non-REM to REM sequence causes loss of memory rather than refinement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model-Driven Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Combining mouse data with circuit-based simulations revealed how acetylcholine dynamics shape memory during sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Although we know sleep is essential to our physical and mental well-being, it remains an incredibly enigmatic behavior, scientifically speaking. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Michigan, however, may have developed a new theory to account for one of sleep’s looming mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every living thing that sleeps appears to follow the same basic pattern. From wakefulness, organisms transition to a repeating cycle of sleep with low brain activity followed by a stage where our brains are harder at work, among other things, generating vivid dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111099"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain as a tree." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/memory-sleep-sculpting-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;But researchers can’t yet zero in on all the individual neurons encoding specific memories with available techniques, so this is where the team’s modeling stepped in to help complete the picture. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans’ eyes also dance around behind our eyelids during that high-activity stage, which is why it’s referred to as rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there are a few notable exceptions—including people with narcolepsy and people who haven’t slept in days—this repeating non-REM to REM sleep cycle is remarkably prevalent across the animal kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Evolutionarily, it’s so preserved and so ubiquitous across species,” said Sara Aton, U-M professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That means there’s probably something really important about that particular order of sleep. And it never goes in reverse, unless something has really screwed up the system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, scientists have lacked a satisfying explanation for the biological function of this virtually universal phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, U-M researchers led by Aton and Michal Zochowski have put together a theory built on experimental observations in mice and computer modeling of the brain’s neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That theory posits that, if memories were shrubs, the non-REM phase of sleep helps them grow taller and stronger. The REM stage then prunes, keeping them shapely and distinct, and preventing them from overlapping and growing into each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It only works if you have this sequence. If you go in reverse and have REM first, it prunes everything away. Then no memory is left,” Aton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the proper sequence, you reinforce things that need to be reinforced. Then REM comes in to prune back the overlapping portions of unrelated memories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, the researchers could observe the effect of sleep on remembering simple conditioning experiments. In humans, Zochowski said, this could have familiar implications in our everyday business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s say you have three meetings in a day. We know that you’ll remember these meetings better after a good night’s sleep,” Zochowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, it appears that during non-REM sleep, you’re strengthening your memory of each meeting. But you also need to remember who said what and during which meeting. What REM does is keep that separate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;PLoS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt; and was supported by the National Science Foundation, a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was made possible, in part, by advances made by the broader community over the last dozen years, fostered by the NIH’s Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, or BRAIN, Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cycles and circuits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Aton’s team, the researchers’ latest experiments monitored mice brains to see which parts of the hippocampus were active during different phases of sleep following a simple conditioning scenario. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice were moved from their home enclosures to a new environment and, after exploring a couple minutes, would receive a small shock to their feet. There was also a control group of mice who experienced no such unpleasantries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This enabled the researchers to compare brain activity of sleeping mice during REM and non-REM cycles that had and hadn’t forged an association between the new space and a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But researchers can’t yet zero in on all the individual neurons encoding specific memories with available techniques, so this is where the team’s modeling stepped in to help complete the picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model was developed by Zochowski’s group and treats newly encoded memories as changes in the activity of neurons in circuits, subject to the brain’s environment where a biochemical called acetylcholine modulates their activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can actually simulate and pinpoint which neurons are being activated by a learning event,” Aton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can model that and we can model changes that happen with respect to acetylcholine as an animal goes through the different stages of sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also two types of neurons: excitatory ones that tend to stimulate their neighbors and inhibitory ones that tamp down the activity of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining these dynamics with real world data on brain activity and acetylcholine levels during different phases of sleep, the model helped reveal conclusions that were previously inaccessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers are excited by the result, they stressed that this is not the final word on the matter. Their circuit model is a simplified representation of the brain and the team’s experiments tested relatively straightforward memory scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the theory could change or evolve as researchers subject it to more complex test cases and provide it with new and different types of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we have now is a study that says, ‘Look, this is what could be happening,'” Zochowski said. “Now we have to prove that the model is associated with reality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#620f031616120d101622170f0b010a4c070617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Matt Davenport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umich.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Matt Davenport – University of Michigan&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cholinergic modulation of neural networks supports sequential and complementary roles for NREM and REM states in memory consolidation&lt;/a&gt;” by Sara Aton et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Computational Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cholinergic modulation of neural networks supports sequential and complementary roles for NREM and REM states in memory consolidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across vertebrate species, sleep consists of repeating cycles of NREM followed by REM. However, their respective functions, and their stereotypic cycling pattern are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a simplified biophysical network model, we investigate the potential role of cholinergic modulation, acting via the muscarinic receptors, on network dynamics and memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that low and high cholinergic levels associated with NREM and REM sleep, respectively, may play critical, sequential roles in memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network dynamics that facilitate these roles arise through alteration of neural excitability and changes to network-wide excitatory/inhibitory balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At low acetylcholine (ACh) levels, reduced activation of inhibitory neurons leads to network-wide disinhibition and bursts of synchronized activity led by engram neurons, driving recruitment of additional excitatory neurons into the engram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, at high ACh levels, increased network inhibition suppresses firing in all but the most strongly recruited excitatory neurons, pruning the expanded engram population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these results provide a testable hypothesis regarding the role of sleep state-specific cholinergic modulation in the process of memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 20:22:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE5vTHkwTkluUjVHcGRrb2h6RXBZbkFPSTUydm8tNklIaS1aMzlXMnlSdkV4S1JCVzZiX3VkYUx3NFYyb3lSckFTOXBkSlpoYWpTN0tLYlowdWtfeXdrV3Z1MWpKYXpkQnVnQlE</guid></item><item><title>GLP-1药物帮助1型糖尿病患者保持健康的血糖水平和减肥- STAT | GLP-1 drug helped type 1 diabetes patients keep healthy glucose levels and lose weight - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQSmlWb1BpYkp2dEVNMlZHRGVPQUZHZEVLbmdhVDdtVkZ5RHJER2FuNzdLRms3SlE1T3FMX3Zsdm5Ma0F1UzllblB6cm1WS0s4aHNBWklCNE9PVWkxN3FuZ1ZfZ190Y3llQXcyQjVoQ0dNRVdnV2Z2TUlodE5vVXB4V2NzRTBsWEE4NXhIQ2lrWTh5UTctU2xrX2JHay12MmFjR2JFNE9YTmxjeV9ZVEpocmpxUHk5UVBYeHliRkZ6dVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="author-pop-over" data-author="elizabeth-cooney"&gt;&lt;p class="author-bio"&gt;Elizabeth Cooney is a cardiovascular disease reporter at STAT, covering heart, stroke, and metabolic conditions.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity drugs were first approved to treat type 2 diabetes, but there’s a growing movement to test them in type 1 diabetes, too. Research presented Monday at a large diabetes meeting showed some promise for this approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Patients who took a GLP-1 drug fared better than those in a control group at keeping their blood glucose levels in a healthy range while also losing more weight than those who weren’t taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded, randomized control trial enrolled 72 adults with a BMI of 30 or higher who use automated insulin delivery systems to manage their type 1 diabetes. Split into two groups, half received weekly 1-milligram injections of semaglutide — the preferred GLP-1 drug and dose when the study was designed five years ago — and half received a placebo. &lt;/p&gt;

Yet beneath the mop of filaments sits an anglerfish that can inhale prey faster than most cameras can blink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marine ecologist Dr. Maarten De Brauwer of &lt;a href="https://research.csiro.au/environomics/our-people/early-career-researchers-separate-bios/dr-maarten-brauwer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Curtin University&lt;/a&gt; first noticed that the fish’s lure shines neon orange under blue light, while the rest of the body stays dull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team’s 2016 field &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-016-1493-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; on Philippine reefs linked that glow to free‑swimming worms that share the same color and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hairy-frogfish-hides-by-copying-reef-textures"&gt;Hairy frogfish hides by copying reef textures&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hairy frogfish belongs to the anglerfish &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/frogfish-lure-their-prey-with-a-built-in-fishing-rod-and-bait/"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt;, but instead of lurking in the deep it prowls coral rubble in tropical shallows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A coat of branching spinules lets it copy the texture of algae, sponge, or coral until the head seems to vanish into the seafloor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals can swap pattern and shade within weeks, shifting from lemon yellow to mottled black as sediment, light, and growth change around them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That rapid makeover is a textbook example of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519323002801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Batesian mimicry&lt;/a&gt;, a tactic where harmless looks discourage predators while inviting unsuspecting prey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sight alone does not give the trick away, because even the fish’s eyes carry radiating stripes that obscure the pupil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the stubby “arm” formed by the first dorsal spine, called the &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/illicium-zoology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;illicium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, rises above the camouflage like a tiny fishing pole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-glowing-lure-helps-the-hairy-frogfish"&gt;How the glowing lure helps the hairy frogfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These observations indicate a novel function, prey capture, for biofluorescence in coral reef fishes,” wrote De Brauwer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under daylight the &lt;em&gt;illicium&lt;/em&gt; ends in a dull worm‑shaped tassel, but blue‑filtered lamps reveal intense &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59528-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;biofluorescence&lt;/a&gt; that converts blue light to orange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea fits a wider pattern, because a survey of 180 fish species found &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0083259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glowing pigments&lt;/a&gt; clustered in cryptic reef lineages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Museum of Natural History&lt;/a&gt; ichthyologist &lt;a href="https://www.amnh.org/research/staff-directory/john-s-sparks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. John Sparks&lt;/a&gt; noted that “biofluorescence is especially common and morphologically variable in cryptically patterned coral‑reef lineages,” hinting at communication or hunting value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By matching the fluorescent worms that drift over sandy bottoms at night, the lure likely acts as a living decoy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/deep-sea-anglerfish-defy-evolutionary-expectations/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; twitches the tip in arcs and pulses that copy the jellied plankton’s swim, drawing curious gobies and cardinalfish within lunging range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fastest-strikes-on-record"&gt;Fastest strikes on record&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a victim lines up, the mouth opens twelve times wider than its resting size, pulling in water and prey through rapid &lt;a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/discover-fish/species-profiles/striated-frogfish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;suction feeding&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High‑speed videos have timed the attack at just six milliseconds, making the frogfish one of the quickest predators recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That burst happens because elastic ligaments around the jaw store energy while the fish crouches. Releasing the latch snaps the head forward, creating a pressure wave that drags prey inward before the target knows it moved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stomach then stretches like a balloon, letting a four‑inch frogfish swallow a meal almost twice its own length. Mouth, stomach, and even gill covers reset within minutes, ready for the next ambush without swimming far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hairy-frogfish-lives-without-swimming"&gt;Hairy frogfish lives without swimming&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frogfish seldom swim, preferring a slow shuffle powered by limb‑like pectoral and pelvic fins. The gait looks clumsy, yet it lets the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/world-frog-day-2025-protecting-natures-tiny-guardians/"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; creep through branching corals or over sponges without stirring mud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://fishbase.se/summary/Antennarius-striatus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FishBase&lt;/a&gt; records show the species from New Jersey to Brazil and across the Indo‑Pacific, at depths ranging from tide pools to 720 feet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most adults settle below 100 feet where wave surge is gentle, but juveniles often lurk among shore grass beds that teem with shrimp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Males change color during courtship, trailing females to the surface where a buoyant ribbon of up to 288,000 eggs drifts free. Larvae hatch in open water and later drop to the bottom, beginning the camouflage dance anew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-findings-mean"&gt;What the findings mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aggressive mimicry allows a predator to masquerade as something harmless to approach prey,” wrote marine zoologist &lt;a href="https://zoolstud.sinica.edu.tw/Journals/44.3/299.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;John E. Randall&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressive mimicry, where a predator disguises itself as the prey’s food, shows up in a handful of reef hunters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluorescent lure adds a light signal to that illusion, effective only for animals with visual pigments tuned to blue and green. Future lab tests will measure how often fish reject non‑fluorescent lures compared with glowing ones, refining ideas about sensory ecology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these cues may also improve non‑invasive survey methods that use fluorescence to spot cryptic species on night dives. Conservation teams already trial blue‑light transects to count seahorses and pipefish that vanish under white lamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-protect-hairy-frogfish"&gt;How to protect hairy frogfish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antennarius striatus&lt;/em&gt; sits on the &lt;a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/16406979/115354869#assessment-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IUCN list&lt;/a&gt; as “Least Concern,” but habitat loss threatens local populations on polluted coasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors sometimes trawl adults for the aquarium trade, yet demand remains modest compared with bright reef staples like clownfish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting rubble fields and sea‑grass beds will likely benefit the frogfish alongside countless small invertebrates. Marine parks can also restrict night fishing with lights that might interfere with fluorescent signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizen scientists armed with blue torches contribute valuable sightings through photo databases. Each image builds a map of occurrence, molt timing, and lure color that researchers can mine for long‑term trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00338-016-1493-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coral Reefs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 19:46:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPeFV6TWFtOTQtQlpYcDl1NTBSekctaXRDNHJtVE5jcW1pWElBSHVrVWJHTXlxTl9MUFVUSlFvZFZRSDFTSnM1RXpSTzZ2dFJGM1hxYkxvNnd2cC1hZnJLZ3hhS2lhXzZQOVMyMERJcUd0TnJrMEdIb1ZWX2dqdUZ6Zmw3MHptQVV4QWFGS0xoN3UxSlNmRnhTekVvSUhEYlMxanY3ek15ZlNkZW8</guid></item><item><title>科学家在日常活动中取得了巨大的痴呆症突破，这可能会减缓甚至预防疾病-每日邮报 | Scientists make huge dementia breakthrough with everyday activity that may slow or even prevent disease - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxNMm92d3lwOFUzUS1VUS13RlR5Y2dfdnFpbWpJMmsydVZzdlJ3NzMzZDlyYkxRYXNmdER0V1JTeFktbFZOMjFBRlpKT1k5N2drb0lRQzlnWkVPZjFmU2NDeVFKSlB3M0ZVVUJwX3g1SXNzakRlS1d4UzZwOUsxWElJR194aTJWN2t2UE04cEx2bzFjNzV6LVBVdzJDQi1XSURibC1YZDBEdFBERThWRE5KUkdTLXN2ejdHMjBmTjJHcmN4WlFncnplWVM1UWpIRC1YbTZ3Nw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Listening to the radio or playing your favorite songs while you cook may bolster your memory and reduce your risk of dementia later in life, new research reveals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A team of scientists from Rice University in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/texas/index.html" id="mol-dd72edd0-505e-11f0-be41-87375c09d163"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; and the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-dd71b550-505e-11f0-be41-87375c09d163"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-dd722a80-505e-11f0-be41-87375c09d163"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;, tested college students' memories by having them complete tasks while they weren't listening to music and then again when they were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-9593987/University-Pittsburgh-study-finds-making-music-help-dementia-cognitive-issues.html"&gt;stronger emotional response&lt;/a&gt; to the music they heard showed a better ability to remember the images of everyday activities they were quizzed on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team built upon years of research that examined the power of music for memory, but added that the mechanism for remembering is how emotional people become while listening to the music. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings could have a wide-reaching impact, offering hope for the 8.6 million Americans with dementia, more than 7 million of whom have Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sanam Hafeez, a neuropsychologist, told the Daily Mail music can be part of an effective tool in reducing the risk and possibly slowing the progression of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Music helps tap into memories and emotions that might otherwise feel out of reach,' she said. 'Over time, that kind of stimulation might delay how quickly symptoms progress.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers believe that a 'moderate' emotional response bolsters the connection between parts of the brain, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-2521856/Listening-pop-music-help-people-severe-brain-injuries-recall-memories.html"&gt;improving people's memories&lt;/a&gt;.

That’s why emotionally charged music can boost recall of big-picture experiences.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers played music gathered for the study by searching emotional keywords like ‘sad,’ ‘happy’ and ‘calming’ on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They chose three songs per category, designed to trigger emotions after having a separate group rate them for pleasantness, familiarity and mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants then completed a memory task sorting 128 everyday objects as ‘indoor’ or ‘outdoor’ - a subtle way to test recall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a 30-minute break, participants repeated the memory task with 192 images - some old, some new - to measure both general and detailed recall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Next, they listened to music, neutral sounds (like crackling fire) or silence for 10 minutes while filling out mood and wellness questionnaires, followed by 20 minutes of quiet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;While the total number of people diagnosed is relatively small, the diagnosis rate of early-onset dementia and Alzheimer's disease is increasing, especially in younger age groups&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, they completed the memory task again, sorting images as old or new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Music successfully prompted an emotional response at differing levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers sorted participants into minor, moderate or significant emotional responses after the listening session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with a moderate emotional response to the music performed better on the last memory test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In contrast, people with either very low or very high emotional responses had poorer memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The more emotionally activated someone is, the more the brain flags that moment as worth storing,' Dr Idoko said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That’s why emotionally charged music can boost recall of big-picture experiences. And why, when an emotional response is more moderate, the brain has more bandwidth to encode the details.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study compared memory in college students, its findings could benefit Americans over 65 who are more likely to experience dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group artSplitter"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Projected yearly incidence of dementia on the basis of current rates (solid lines) and projected incidence of dementia assuming continuation of a decreasing trend (dashed lines)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Every state except one has seen a surge in Alzheimer's fatalities between 1999 and 2021, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) shows&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in the Journal of Neuroscience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older adults who have not been diagnosed with dementia might still begin to exhibit signs of mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 12.2 million Americans are living with mild cognitive impairment - a possible stepping stone to Alzheimer’s that involves memory lapses and mental slowdowns noticeable to the person and those around them, but not severe enough to disrupt daily routines. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain is particularly adept at storing memories of events or phases of one’s life where music played a prominent role, improving their ability to recall memories of those events when that music plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it doesn’t have to be music they know. Past research has shown that patients can recall personal memories in greater detail even when they listen to unfamiliar music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Yelena Sokolsky, a home health nurse and founder of Galaxy Homecare, told the Daily Mail that music therapy is especially valuable for people with early dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As cognitive functioning declines, individuals may struggle with verbal communication - this can lead to feelings of heightened confusion, fear or agitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, music can evoke emotion and memories, bringing comfort even when other forms of communication become challenging.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Britta Reierson, a family physician and obesity medicine specialist in at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.knownwell.co/britta-reierson"&gt;Knownwell&lt;/a&gt;, told DailyMail.com: 'If an individual is experiencing side effects that increase the risk of dehydration, and at the same time are exposed to environmental impacts such as a heat wave when the need for hydration is higher, dehydration can occur much more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heat waves cause increased sweating as the body tries to cool down and maintain a normal body temperature. This additional fluid loss, combined with fluid loss from nausea, vomiting and reduced intake, can lead to severe dehydration and heat related illness if not properly managed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 1,200 Americans die from heat-related causes every year, though officials note the actual number could be 10-fold higher due to underreporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, about one in eight Americans - around 40million - has reported taking a GLP-1 agonist at some point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 agonists mimic the hormone GLP-1, which is released after eating, to slow digestion and increase feelings of fullness. In turn, this leads to eating - and drinking - less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sandip Sachar, a dentist at Sachar Dental in New York City, said while 'this effect is more pronounced with food emptying, it can also slow the emptying of liquids.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;GLP-1 receptors are found in the lamina terminalis, a region of the brain that senses thirst and regulates water balance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight-loss drugs may bind to those areas to decrease feelings of thirst, though research on this mechanism is still early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sachar said: 'Slowing of GI emptying may reduce hunger and also may prevent thirst. Patients have told me that when they feel full, it is more difficult to drink a lot of water.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People taking Ozempic or similar drugs for obesity are also more likely to have conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney disease, all of which raise the risk of dehydration, Dr Reierson said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These conditions may reduce thirst and lead to retention and other fluid imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ashley Koff, a registered dietitian and founder of the Better Nutrition Program, also told DailyMail.com: 'When you are taking a medication that slows gastric emptying, dehydration is a concern because the stomach acid and digestive juices, as well as overall metabolism and digestion and elimination, require optimal hydration.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kavin Mistry, a neuroradiologist and longevity expert, also pointed to common GLP-1 side effects like nausea and vomiting as a cause of dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When fluid is not being replaced efficiently, the risk of dehydration increases, particularly in warmer weather when water needs are already higher,' he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, eating less food overall also decreases fluid intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Reierson told this website: 'We often forget that food contributes to our daily water intake and eating less can lead to lower hydration.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Summertime favorites like watermelon, cucumbers and tomatoes are more than 90 percent water and can help boost fluid intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Sachar also recommends chewing sugar-free gum to increase saliva production, which can stave off dehydration, and steer clear of acidic foods and sugary drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Dr Reierson added: 'I don’t recommend that patients at higher risk for dehydration stop or not take a GLP-1 medication, however, it is important to exercise extra caution and work with your healthcare provider to ensure a comprehensive plan and strategy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mistry recommends people on weight-loss drugs set reminders to drink water regularly, even if you're not thirsty, and steer clear of drinks like caffeine and alcohol, which are dehydrating.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

For healthy adults, the risk of illness after being licked by a pet that receives regular veterinary care is negligible. But when dogs and cats lick people with weak immune systems, serious infections can follow. Here’s what to know about why pets do this, and when you should be concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QUY7FTIC4JD2PEXXZKKWB7CVMU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QUY7FTIC4JD2PEXXZKKWB7CVMU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why do dogs and cats lick people?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WZDDHADUUFG2NDT677G6MOGI4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/pet-insurance/pet-ownership-statistics/"&gt;More than 60 percent of U.S. households&lt;/a&gt; include a pet, for good reason: pet ownership reduces loneliness, depression and anxiety. Rustin Moore, dean of the veterinary school at Ohio State University and &lt;a href="https://www.rustinmooredvm.com/about"&gt;author of an upcoming book&lt;/a&gt; on the human-animal bond, says this bond “has a profound power to heal, comfort and connect us; it is one of the most underutilized tools for improving human well-being.” Animal-assisted therapy is increasingly used in schools, nursing homes, hospices, prisons and hospitals, with benefits that include reduced pain perception, more rapid recovery from surgery, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40106503/"&gt;improved emotional skills&lt;/a&gt; in children with disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6A4TOJAJOZHJNLRQGXVRY3AEZI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Licking is a common behavior in pets. In a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7345801/"&gt;2020 study from Belgium&lt;/a&gt;, hand-licking by dogs was reported by 86 percent of owners — and face-licking by 50 percent of owners. In &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18390853/"&gt;a study in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, more than 50 percent of people said their dogs licked visitors, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CGDY7YA3WBCSFP3Q5C2MU3PGJE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Animals lick other animals for many reasons. New moms lick their babies to clean and protect them (saliva has certain &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003193849090332X?via%3Dihub"&gt;antibacterial properties,&lt;/a&gt; which also could explain why animals lick their wounds). Animals also lick one another during “social grooming,” a bonding behavior that is particularly common in cats. A dog may lick humans to show &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22644113/"&gt;empathy&lt;/a&gt;. And — given the opportunity — pets will meticulously lick skin that has traces of food or salty sweat on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJURIOWXZJBQFGW4B3DDYWWR4Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When it’s reinforced by positive social interactions (such as petting and a soothing voice), licking also can be a way to get attention. Genetics, other environmental influences, and age also influence licking behavior — in the U.K. study, younger dogs were more likely to lick people than older dogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="OK32PJYIUZH3HJOBZVFI2FJLNE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="OK32PJYIUZH3HJOBZVFI2FJLNE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Are there germs in my pet’s saliva?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q24DCCUYCBEV7EZ7D4PTCKHE2E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In short, yes. Despite saliva’s antibacterial effects, a pet’s mouth harbors billions of bacteria just waiting to infect humans when introduced into open wounds. Within this “bacterial soup” are two organisms with tongue-twisting names and a special ability to cause severe human disease: &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga canimorsus&lt;/i&gt; (capno-sigh-toh-fah-gah canny-morse-us), a long, rod-shaped bug; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella multocida &lt;/i&gt;(par-stew-rella mul-tee-sigh-dar), a tiny oval-shaped bug. Although I wish these organisms had nicknames, they don’t — so I’ll just call them &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;here (recognizing that there are other &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella&lt;/i&gt; species that are not important causes of human disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DBPD2XHQHFDPRN3GXI4CTMIFU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you own a dog or cat, you probably live with these germs — they’re found in most healthy dogs and cats. &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; inhabits the mouth of more than 70 percent of dogs and 55 percent of cats, whereas &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;is found in more than 50 percent of dogs and more than 70 percent of cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="FMG6C27YBBHRZNPFMIOEHEQILQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="FMG6C27YBBHRZNPFMIOEHEQILQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why do doctors worry about these two bugs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A2O4XOPFOZFURFGC3BVQ6VSP34" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Although rare, &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;infections are concerning, because they progress rapidly, and up to one-third of infections can be fatal. Within just a few days of a lick or bite, &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; can multiply in your blood and cause critical organs to fail. These infections are also hard to diagnose, because &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; grows slowly in the laboratory. The most severe form of infection — a gruesome gangrenous skin condition known as purpura fulminans — has a mortality rate of 60 percent. Survivors often face amputation of fingers, toes or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EKDWCRLAMNBV3MP423GWUVRU3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pasteurella&lt;/i&gt; infections are more common, because &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;is frequently involved in bite wound infections (think of it as the common cat bite bug). Much less often, serious &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections follow licking, especially in babies or people that allow pets to lick open wounds or medical devices. With increasing animal ownership and advancements in human medical therapy, reports of &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27544345/"&gt;knee and hip replacements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32192435/"&gt;peritoneal dialysis&lt;/a&gt; systems and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21687004/"&gt;long-term vascular access devices&lt;/a&gt; are increasing. “We have seen serious &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;infections that arose after cats — especially kittens — chewed on and contaminated dialysis equipment,” says Natascha Tuznik, an infectious-disease physician at the University of California-Davis. “Such equipment should always be kept away from pets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="66UV6RRQBNGAJIFRIWIBYLKUD4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="66UV6RRQBNGAJIFRIWIBYLKUD4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How often does licking lead to serious infections?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XGPVMPRWCNHFRHFZ2NXORKNNHY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While bacteria like &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;are very common in your pet’s saliva, it’s incredibly rare for people to get sick after being licked. Every year, millions of bloodstream infections occur in North America and Europe, but fewer &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;than 600 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39474551/"&gt;infections and just 20 cases of purpura fulminans&lt;/a&gt; have ever been reported. Infections from licking are most likely to occur in infants, pregnant people, people over 50, or people with conditions such as AIDS, cancer, alcoholism, diabetes or organ transplants. Tuznik notes that “people who lack a functioning spleen are particularly susceptible to &lt;i&gt;Capnocytophaga&lt;/i&gt; infections and are specifically advised to avoid being licked by pets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="XACGUYAW2VCT7PNGU6G2ERM4OE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="XACGUYAW2VCT7PNGU6G2ERM4OE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How can I reduce the chance of infection from licking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EE4LK3UWJERLC5IWIHBDMZIOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Wash your skin with soap and water after being licked. Avoid sharing food dishes and utensils with your pet (no more fork feeding!). Prevent pets from licking open wounds or medical devices. And people in high-risk groups should limit contact to snuggles instead of smooches. If you (or people you care for) have a weak immune system and illness develops, tell your health care provider about any known animal contact. When doctors know which bacteria to suspect, the result is earlier treatment, faster recovery and fewer complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="46ADBWOPHVEN3BL2N47PNQ6NZA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="46ADBWOPHVEN3BL2N47PNQ6NZA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;I’m immunocompromised.

Remember, pet ownership can ease the emotional burdens often experienced by people with chronic illnesses. Even if your pet licks you, the chance of infection is minuscule.

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;PMDD is characterized by severe emotional (e.g., depressed mood), physical (e.g., fatigue), and cognitive (e.g., difficulties concentrating) symptoms that occur in the days before menstruation. PMDD is a serious mental health condition that is associated with severe outcomes, including an increased risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, led by Dr. Thomas Broughton, a postdoctoral researcher, and Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais, a senior lecturer at Queen Mary University of London, collected online questionnaire responses from over seven hundred women in the UK. The questions asked about individuals' ADHD diagnosis and symptoms, PMDD symptoms, and co-occurring anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared ADHD and non-ADHD groups and found that women with a clinical ADHD diagnosis were over three times more likely to meet criteria for PMDD than those without. Women who had high levels of ADHD symptoms and impairment (even if they did not have a diagnosis from a clinician) were also over four times more likely to have PMDD. The risk for PMDD was highest among women with ADHD who also had a depression or anxiety diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that women with ADHD, and especially those with ADHD and depression/anxiety, may benefit from PMDD screening. This is the case even if they don't have a formal ADHD diagnosis but have high ADHD symptoms and impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais, who supervised the project, said, "Because ADHD was historically considered a condition that mainly affected boys, many issues specific to females have been overlooked, including associations between ADHD and times of hormonal change. Our findings emphasize the need to consider issues affecting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/adult+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;adult women&lt;/a&gt; with ADHD, and more specifically how females with ADHD may be at higher risk for experiencing PMDD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Broughton added, "Our findings also suggest that further research is needed to improve understanding of the link between ADHD and times of hormonal change, including the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/menstrual+cycle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt;, and to reduce health inequalities and diagnostic bias in women and girls with ADHD."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team includes Dr. Thomas Broughton (Queen Mary University of London), Dr. Ellen Lambert (King's College London), Dr. Jasmin Wertz (University of Edinburgh) and Dr. Jessica Agnew-Blais (Queen Mary University of London).&lt;/p&gt;

Experts are interested in medications that have the potential to boost longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent meta-analysis published in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Wiley" rationale="Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Aging Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; explored how rapamycin and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/metformin-oral-tablet" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; influenced longevity among several animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results confirmed that dietary restriction appears to prolong life and that rapamycin offers similar benefits.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers also found that metformin did not seem to prolong life. More research is required to see how rapamycin might help boost longevity in people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper, researchers note that decreasing food intake without malnourishment appears to prolong life but that this strategy is difficult for people to stick to. Thus, looking into possible medications that produce similar effects is an area of research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two medications that were the focus of this analysis were rapamycin and metformin. According to the National Cancer Institute, &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Cancer Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/rapamycin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;rapamycin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; has a few functions, such as being an immunosuppressant and antibiotic, and it can help people who get transplants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK518983/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Metformin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; helps with type 2 diabetes management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This analysis involved a systematic literature search to find relevant data. The final analysis included data from 167 papers looking at eight total vertebrate species, seeking to see how both medications affected longevity and how they compared to dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers extracted information on average and median lifespan from the papers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this analysis, the two types of dietary restriction were caloric reduction and fasting, and researchers also sought to see if the results differed based on the sex of the animals involved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data came from animals like mice, rats, turquoise killifish, and rhesus macaques. Overall, there were more males studied than females. There was also the most data on dietary restriction, and the most common type of dietary restriction was decreasing the number of calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding dietary restriction, the findings suggested great variation regarding the effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, researchers found that dietary restriction and rapamycin had a similar impact and appeared to contribute to prolonged life. Metformin appeared to only have a minimal impact on life extension.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from one metformin model, there appeared to be no consistent differences between male and female animals regarding longevity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3224-8812" data-type="link" data-id="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3224-8812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Zahida Sultanova&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a Leverhulme Early Career Research Fellow with the University of East Anglia, in the United Kingdom summarized the key findings of the study to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We checked whether the two best-known ‘diet-mimic’ drugs increase lifespan similar to eating less in animals. By pooling data from 167 studies, we found that rapamycin is almost as reliable as eating less for increasing lifespan, whereas metformin is not. In other words, a compound that was extracted from soil bacteria 50 years ago seems able to copy many of the biological effects of a permanent diet, at least in lab animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research analyzed animal data but did not include data about people. Additionally, most of these studies involved these animals in a laboratory setting and only looked at a small number of species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meta-analysis was also the work of only three researchers, sometimes with only one researcher doing a component of the work, which could have impacted the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers had the least amount of data on metformin, so more research about this medication might be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also operated under the assumption that if a paper did not specify male or female subjects, it was a mixed group, which could have been incorrect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors further note that the “results were sensitive to how lifespan was reported.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also acknowledge strong publication bias and a lot of heterogeneity. Additionally, the type of measure used in study reporting affected results. In one measurement, the impact on life extension disappeared for rapamycin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the authors did not find a consistent difference in results based on the sex of the animals. They explain this could be because of “differences in taxonomic groups studied […] and the calculated effect size.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sultanova noted the following cautions regarding the findings: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study includes a high number of scientific studies conducted on different organisms such as mice, fish and monkeys. However, survival results in humans are not included because these drugs were not tested in humans for lifespan extension. Even if they are, the studies will take a long time considering the length of human lifespan. So, we do not recommend people to take rapamycin before the results of human trials consistently show that there are no side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers suggest the need for research involving other species in natural and laboratory settings. They also note the need to understand the difference in impact for “different strains of the same species exposed to the same treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research can further focus on the differences between rapamycin and metformin and why they impact lifespan differently. More research into the differences in rapamycin’s results in males and females could be helpful as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research can be done to see if rapamycin can promote prolonged life in people, but there may be some challenges in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, a board-certified general surgeon, bariatric surgeon, and medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, who was not involved in the study, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that it “shows the contribution of the immune system to lifespan, as rapamycin is an immunosuppressive medication.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to him: “The most logical next step is to explore the findings in humans; however, this would be a difficult study to design as rapamycin is a medication used in specific cancers and organ transplant and has significant side effects.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the results show a potential benefit of rapamycin that warrants more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sultanova explained that: “Clinically, that puts rapamycin (and the mTOR pathway it targets) at the front of the queue for future anti-ageing therapies in humans. The compound had already been used for organ-transplant patients, so medical professionals understand its potential side effects.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is waiting for the results of ongoing human trials that test lower and intermittent doses of rapamycin and refining the compound to ‘rapalog’ versions that keep the benefits while omitting side-effects such as immune suppression,“ she told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another important next step would be developing drugs that are similar in structure and function to rapamycin but without the side-effects. Scientists have already started refining rapamycin and producing the so-called rapalogs,” Sultanova noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:34:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxOaF9yTXBkd2RSMXFpejV1V3M5a3BtZjZkb3JPTFZzSF9ZUkFJWl9RR25jM3pUQl9RUlRCMGZuRGo1WlFDaElvQXA5ZHNrRHYzY2J2TUpZZmxYVFdpaEZYbk12bGlOMkZ5WFdNZmxiUDNWdzY1SHJRS2lBYnFpSTRLSEJyTldYU3lJV3dOYll5UTBoVnhIanM4UmJaM2VSVDVaWEVwb1o4V3FwUkkzUzBF</guid></item><item><title>生酮饮食中的脂肪成分可能会影响MS的结果-今日多发性硬化症新闻 | Fat composition in ketogenic diet may influence outcomes in MS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxQT1E5bHVCQ1RPQlo1MWdFLW9QeHM2djRzX1lIZFp4bmgzUTdNSk1Db0lxd1RyX0x2MHcwb1Rhd29sR0F1YlZXcTRmZlJRNDMxZERsNUxldFZfRHBHcXUzcFVlSHEzZ2lhaUVqVFFRRGlDaEpmWE0ydFlkNGdSQlRiWmdXNFdTajZ5M1ZjNW1hMGwzR2NjQnFITGIzc08tLVRjaHlZa0F0THUxSjFad09uWWxRaDc0X1JUQm9NS3Zn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ketogenic diet — a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet — rich in long-chain, saturated fatty acids like those in butter and fatty red meat didn’t reduce optic nerve damage in a mouse model of &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), a study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, feeding mice this type of diet before the onset of their disease modestly worsened certain visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While ketogenic diets have been proposed to offer anti-inflammatory benefits to people with MS, the findings suggest the type of fat used may be a critical factor when considering such diets as a treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We present new data that the use of [the ketogenic diet] in the treatment of MS should take the composition of the [the ketogenic diet] into consideration,” the researchers wrote in the study, “&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1587760/full"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A high-saturated, long-chain fatty acid ketogenic diet negatively impacts visual and motor-sensory function in a pre-clinical model of multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” which was published in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MS is &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/risk-factors-for-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by immune-mediated damage to the brain and spinal cord, which gives rise to various &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;neurological manifestations&lt;/a&gt;. One of the first signs of MS is &lt;a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/about-ms/signs-and-symptoms/eyes-and-sight/optic-neuritis"&gt;optic neuritis&lt;/a&gt;, or inflammation of the optic nerve that carries signals from the eyes to the brain. This can lead to vision problems, including blurred vision, and impaired color vision and depth perception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ketogenic (keto) diet is a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat regimen originally developed to manage seizure disorders, but that may also have anti-inflammatory effects. The diet forces the body to rely on fat rather than sugar for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest a keto diet may &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/08/02/benefits-ketogenic-diet-rrms-may-be-long-lasting-if-adherence/"&gt;help ease fatigue and improve exercise capacity&lt;/a&gt;, cognition, and hand dexterity in people with MS. However, research in mouse models of MS has yielded mixed results, possibly because some studies used medium-chain fatty acids and others used long-chain fatty acids, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These studies suggest the need for further analysis of the [keto diets] utilized in [MS] studies and exploration of how the chain length and saturation effects outcomes,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Keto diet’s effects on MS mouse model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of Iowa examined the effects of a keto diet made up of long-chain, saturated fatty acids on optic neuritis using mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an induced disease that’s often used to model MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-chain, saturated fatty acids are those typically found in red meats (beef, lamb, pork), dairy products (full-fat milk, cream, cheese, butter), and coconut and palm oil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mice were fed either the keto or standard diet starting before their disease induction, at the time of induction, or at symptom onset. Along with disease severity, optic neuritis was assessed by measuring visual acuity and electrical impulses along the optic nerve, and by imaging and tissue analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mice that began the keto diet before EAE induction showed significantly worse disease severity than those on a standard diet. No significant differences were seen when the diet was introduced at disease induction or symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual acuity also declined more severely in mice pretreated with the keto diet, but again, no differences were seen in the groups that started the diet later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We propose that pretreatment with a long-chain, saturated [ketogenic diet] … leads to an initial priming of the immune system that results in a more robust immune response and inflammatory cascade when disease induction occurs,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, some aspects of optic nerve health weren’t affected by diet. Imaging of the retina, a light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, showed similar thinning of nerve layers across all EAE groups, regardless of diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the strength and speed of visual signals along the optic nerve were impaired in EAE mice compared with healthy mice, but these impairments didn’t differ between the diet groups. Tissue analyses also showed similar levels of optic nerve damage in EAE mice across all the diet groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our results demonstrate that irrespective of the timing of its implementation, a long-chain, saturated fatty acid [ketogenic diet] does not significantly improve visual outcomes in EAE mice,” wrote the researchers, who noted the findings underscore the importance of considering fat composition, and not just the amount of specific macronutrients, when evaluating the potential use of ketogenic diets in managing MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Multiple Sclerosis News Today</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:19:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQT1E5bHVCQ1RPQlo1MWdFLW9QeHM2djRzX1lIZFp4bmgzUTdNSk1Db0lxd1RyX0x2MHcwb1Rhd29sR0F1YlZXcTRmZlJRNDMxZERsNUxldFZfRHBHcXUzcFVlSHEzZ2lhaUVqVFFRRGlDaEpmWE0ydFlkNGdSQlRiWmdXNFdTajZ5M1ZjNW1hMGwzR2NjQnFITGIzc08tLVRjaHlZa0F0THUxSjFad09uWWxRaDc0X1JUQm9NS3Zn</guid></item><item><title>想知道你能活多久吗？这个10秒钟的坐立测试可能有答案-印度时报 | Want to know how long you’ll live?

That’s not hype. According to a long-term study conducted in Brazil, your ability to perform this simple action without any assistance from your hands, knees, or support may hold clues about your longevity and risk of death from natural causes like heart disease or cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This test, often referred to as the “sit and rise” test, doesn’t rely on fancy gym equipment or medical diagnostics. It takes less than 10 seconds, requires no special gear, and yet it may reflect deep insights into your balance, strength, flexibility, and coordination. In fact, researchers found that adults who struggled with this basic movement were significantly more likely to die over the next decade compared to those who completed it with ease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, as reported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;, come from a team of researchers at an exercise medicine clinic in Rio de Janeiro, led by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr. Claudio Gil Araujo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Over 12 years, the team observed over 4,200 adults, uncovering a striking link between this simple movement and long-term survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore what they found and why this test might be the wake-up call we didn’t know we needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your score on this 10-point test may predict your risk of early death&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tracked 4,282 men and women between the ages of 46 and 75, evaluating their ability to sit down and stand up from the floor without using their hands, knees, or any support. Each participant received a score out of 10, broken into two components - five points for sitting, five for standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the 12 years, researchers observed a stark correlation: the lower the score, the higher the risk of death. Participants who scored between 0 and 4 points were six times more likely to die during the follow-up period than those who earned a perfect 10. Those in the middle range (scoring 4.5 to 7.5) faced two to three times the mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most eye-opening was this: half of the individuals who scored zero did not survive the 12 years, compared to just 4% of those who scored a full 10. That’s an 11-fold difference in mortality rates based on one deceptively simple movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A simple test that uncovers strength, balance, and longevity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, sitting down and standing up seem trivial. But as Dr. Araujo explained to The Washington Post, the movement is surprisingly complex. It draws on several physical abilities at once, notably:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle strength, especially in the legs and core&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility, which declines as we age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance, a major factor in fall prevention&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordination and body composition, both tied to cardiovascular and metabolic health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The test works because it captures all of these components in one fluid motion,” Araujo explained. “If someone struggles, it may reflect broader issues with inflammation, mobility, or muscle loss—factors known to contribute to chronic diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, it’s not just about the movement. It’s what that movement reveals about the body’s inner health, especially as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One lost point = 31% higher risk of death, says study&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that every point lost in the test correlated with a 31% increase in mortality risk, even when controlling for age, gender, and BMI. Those who required a hand, knee, or another part of the body for support had lower scores and also higher mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the deaths in this study weren’t all related to heart disease. Many were from natural causes, such as cancer and age-related decline. This suggests the test reflects overall vitality, not just cardiovascular strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The study has gaps, yet the test still offers &lt;keyword id="27448230" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="real-health-clues" source="Orion"&gt;real health clues&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like any study, this one comes with caveats. The participants were all drawn from a private exercise medicine clinic in Rio, meaning they may not represent broader populations, especially people with limited access to healthcare or varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Additionally, the study did not account for smoking status, which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and pulmonary disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, experts agree the findings are worth paying attention to. “It’s not a diagnostic test,” Araujo clarified. “But it is a practical indicator. It gives people a chance to check in on their physical health without needing to visit a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Want to try the test yourself? Here’s how&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need special equipment to try the sit-and-rise test at home. But Dr. Araujo and his team strongly recommend having a partner nearby, especially for older adults or those with joint problems. Here’s the step-by-step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start in a standing position.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cross one foot over the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Without using your hands, knees, or arms for support, lower yourself to a seated position on the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now, stand back up again without using support.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You begin with 10 points. Subtract 1 point for each time you use your hand, knee, forearm, or side of your leg to help. A loss of balance also subtracts 0.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;(&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note: If you have knee or hip pain or a recent injury, skip this test. Talk to your physician instead.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why basic movement is a better &lt;keyword id="7809223" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="health-indicator" source="Orion"&gt;health indicator&lt;/keyword&gt; than you think&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often focus on how fast we can run, how much we can lift, or how many steps we take in a day. But this research points to something more fundamental: our capacity for basic movement may tell us more about our ageing process than our mile time ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we grow older, preserving strength, balance, and coordination becomes more important than maximising peak performance. This test puts the spotlight on those quiet, everyday capacities we usually take for granted—until we lose them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your score is a signal, not a sentence: Here’s what to do next&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than treating this as a pass-or-fail test of mortality, think of it as a red flag system. If you score low, it’s not a death sentence, it’s a sign that your body may benefit from more mobility work, strength training, and balance-focused activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercises like yoga, tai chi, resistance training, and even daily walking can help improve the very components this test measures. And unlike fad workouts or supplements, these approaches have well-established benefits for heart health, joint health, and inflammation levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 17:13:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgJBVV95cUxNckdnelE2dkxxZkZWYXE3R19yY1VabUdZTDRoU1BZbjdwc1lrQ0wzYlU3NXNGTWszWEplQjFiQjgxbld5cDZsVDRrdmphQ2pORHBIYVRKNElXeEdYbHhDLTRXdXp0dVdxYmxQREdUNzFiX3FyLVZHQmpEV1BNUTU3Z1l5eFgxM2U0OW96bUVDSVZxRVAzaDJDZC14UkZUUHJnUXBnaXVTZFAyT3NLRm54amVzSkFidlhvcEpPSDJjS3JuQXRvNkFpakIyc3VPMklqTEFtdi1KRTROMG84RzhzbEJEeThWQVY5aGpvVThYU0Y0UEd5bkFJRlJaaWJLTEpZS2R5UkJqd2hNc09qNjhtcUVn</guid></item><item><title>胃肠病学家推荐的支持肠道健康的首选补充剂- EatingWell | The #1 Supplement to Support Gut Health, Recommended by a Gastroenterologist - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFB5MTI1NmRuUjNvZ1ZCbGdHbWx2d2JYRWk0SzdXQlZ5U2tGbDE4ZkkzajBCTkdzdFNhUUdJQXQ1MWNYUTFrSXNNcHZTQzIwblZFMDhSSEV4ajJDY3lHYkhJM21wZFU3RlhLYlowdTU5UHZBcGZiWm44dmlzcjh3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A balanced diet with probiotics, prebiotics, fermented food and a variety of plants is good for your gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need a supplement, consider psyllium husk, a gastroenterologist’s top supplement pick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Psyllium husk supports digestion, lowers inflammation in your gut and increases the good bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to supporting your gut health, diet is key. “For some folks, it’s a drag, the fact that their parents were right, but I advise people to try to have a balanced diet,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vcuhealth.org/find-a-provider/profile/stephen-bickston" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Stephen J. Bickston, M.D., AGAF, FACG, FASGE&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to a balanced diet, there are &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;specific gut-loving foods&lt;/a&gt; you can add, including probiotics, prebiotics, fermented foods and a wide variety of plant-based foods. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But if your diet is in check and you’re still struggling with gastrointestinal symptoms or just want to better support your gut, you may want to consider a supplement. Bickston’s go-to? That honor belongs to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-should-take-for-better-heart-health-11698497" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;psyllium husk&lt;/a&gt; or desert Indian wheat, which comes from the &lt;em&gt;Plantago ovata&lt;/em&gt; plant. “Most people have never heard of it &lt;em&gt;[Plantago ovata],”&lt;/em&gt; says Bickston. “But just about everybody’s heard of Metamucil.” That’s right, psyllium husk is the basis of the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-fiber-supplements-8420645" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;popular fiber supplement&lt;/a&gt;, and it can do your gut some good.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bickston has dubbed psyllium husk “an equalizer for the bowels,” because consuming the fiber can help with both constipation and diarrhea.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Psyllium is &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in soluble fiber&lt;/a&gt;, which absorbs water, creating a gel-like substance. In the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7940041/best-fruit-for-constipation-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;case of constipation&lt;/a&gt;, this gel helps soften the stool, making it easier to poop. This same gel-like substance is what lowers cholesterol levels and helps prevent colon cancer.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Conversely, Bickston explains, “When the stool is too runny, fiber sponges up the excess fluid to give it more form. It helps people get to a happy medium.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Improves Gut Bacteria &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium contains the prebiotic complex carbohydrate arabinoxylan, which serves as food for the good bacteria in your gut, leading to a proliferation of friendly intestinal microorganisms. This positive boost in gut bacteria can also offer &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-eat-if-you-have-ibs-11732962" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relief for IBS-constipation symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s good for your gut is often good for your overall health, as is the case here. The good bacteria or probiotics that feed off the prebiotic, arabinoxylan, produce a short-chain fatty acid called butyrate, which supports your gut and immune health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Decreases Gut Inflammation &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Patients with IBS have higher levels of C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker. Psyllium decreases &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894310/anti-inflammatory-meal-plan-for-beginners/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation in the gut&lt;/a&gt; and lowers CRP levels in these patients. At the same time, butyrate, which is produced by bacteria that feed on psyllium, supports the enteric nervous system, improving IBS symptoms.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This one doesn’t exactly better your gut health, but the magic of this benefit certainly happens in your GI tract. Psyllium prevents your stomach from emptying too quickly, which can play a role in managing your appetite. A meta-analysis of six studies found that consuming psyllium fiber before meals (about 10.8 grams per day) led to about a 5-pound &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289462/7-day-high-fiber-meal-plan-1200-calories/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt; in less than five months in people with overweight or obesity. They also lost about an inch around their waistline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth noting, consuming psyllium husk causes side effects in some people, usually bloating or gas. Start slowly, with a small dose, and add as tolerated. And make sure you’re drinking enough water throughout the day to prevent new or worsening constipation.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat your cereal: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s no surprise that Bickston wants you to eat a balanced breakfast. It’s the best way for your gut to start the day, because many &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/153679/how-to-pick-the-healthiest-breakfast-cereal/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;packaged cereals&lt;/a&gt; already contain psyllium. Check the ingredients list on the label for psyllium or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7884127/how-flaxseed-can-help-digestion-make-you-regular/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;psyllium seed husk&lt;/a&gt;. You can also add psyllium to a hot cereal or overnight oats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a smoothie: &lt;/strong&gt;The best alternative to taking a capsule or gummy-style supplement is purchasing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-fiber-supplements-8548491" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;psyllium powder&lt;/a&gt; and pouring it into a smoothie or anything else you can think of. “A teaspoon of the psyllium powder is 4 grams of fiber, and it can be added to whatever else someone likes to eat,” says Bickston. The fiber will help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291987/10-easy-ways-to-make-your-breakfast-smoothie-more-filling/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;add bulk or thicken the smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, similar to ground chia seeds or flaxseed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thicken soups: &lt;/strong&gt;Soups are typically thickened with cornstarch, a roux (flour and butter) or arrowroot. But you can give your soup a boost of fiber by thickening it with psyllium husk powder. Start with adding a tablespoon or less at a time until you reach the desired consistency. Psyllium has an earthy flavor, especially compared to milder options like cornstarch, so make sure to taste-test as you add it. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re eating a well-balanced diet, with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy dose of probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, prebiotics, fermented foods and a wide variety of plant-based foods, you likely don’t need a supplement. But if you’re experiencing GI symptoms or are falling short on your fiber intake, you may want to consider a gastroenterologist’s top supplement pick—psyllium husk.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Psyllium husk can help your gut health by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047475/how-often-should-you-poop/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;normalizing digestion and bowel habits&lt;/a&gt;. It also feeds the good bacteria in your gut and lowers inflammation in the body. But be sure to talk with your health care provider before starting a new supplement, especially if you’re experiencing GI symptoms—this may be a sign of a more serious issue.&lt;br&gt;

(A green Mediterranean diet is a plant-forward form of the classic Mediterranean diet.) These diets were grouped together as "healthy" diets by the researchers.

You can absolutely improve your health without losing a pound,” says Scott Keatley, RD, of &lt;a href="https://keatleymnt.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://keatleymnt.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy" data-node-id="13.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy&lt;/a&gt;. “When someone eats a diet rich in whole, nutrient-dense foods, such as fiber-rich vegetables, omega-3 fats, lean proteins, and fermented foods, you see measurable changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Why? Health eating can improve cellular function, he explains. “You’re essentially making your body more efficient at processing fuel, repairing itself, and defending against disease, all without changing body weight,” Keatley says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It’s also possible for someone’s weight to stay consistent but for their body composition to change, like adding more muscle while losing fat, he says. “Muscle is denser than fat, so the scale might not move much, but body composition is improving significantly,” Keatley says. “That’s a win. More than anything, it’s excess fat, particularly visceral fat, that should be the target of a diet, not just weight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-considered-a-healthy-diet" data-node-id="17" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="17.0"&gt;What is considered a “healthy” diet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In this particular study, the researchers categorized several diets as "healthy" and specifically chose four (low-carb, low-fat, Mediterranean, and green Mediterranean) that enhanced the participants' metabolic health—how well your body converts food into energy—along with other health factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“A ‘healthy’ diet generally refers to a pattern of eating that supports overall well-being, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and provides all essential nutrients for optimal body function,” says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/anat-yaskolka-meir/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/anat-yaskolka-meir/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anat Yaskolka Meir" data-node-id="19.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Anat Yaskolka Meir&lt;/a&gt;, RD, PhD, lead study author and a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Epidemiology at Harvard T.H.

emevuu60"&gt;Meir calls metabolic health “a cornerstone of overall health,” because it reflects how well your body processes and uses energy, usually through blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body fat distribution, she says. “When these systems function properly, the body is more resilient and less prone to chronic diseases,” Meir adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Even without weight loss, having good metabolic health “reduces the load on every major system in the body,” Keatley says,

              &lt;p&gt;If you often have nightmares, you may need to worry a bit more about your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research presented today at the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) Congress 2025 links frequent nightmares to faster biological aging and an over three times higher risk of premature death, even when taking into account other medical conditions. The researchers claim to be the first to demonstrate this association, which could have significant implications for how seriously one should consider persistent nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our sleeping brains cannot distinguish dreams from reality,” Abidemi Otaiku, a neuroscientist at Imperial College London and presumably an author of a forthcoming study, explained in an EAN &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ean-congress-frequent-nightmares-triple-risk-of-early-death-and-accelerate-ageing-major-study-finds-302484308.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s why nightmares often wake us up sweating, gasping for breath, and with our hearts pounding – because our fight-or-flight response has been triggered. This stress reaction can be even more intense than anything we experience while awake.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, researchers tracked the nightmare frequency of adults and children (whose nightmares were reported by their parents) for time periods of up to 19 years. Their results demonstrate that both children and adults who often have nightmares experience accelerated biological aging. Adults who suffered from weekly nightmares were also more than three times as likely to die before the age of 70 as those who rarely or never had nightmares, with the faster biological aging accounting for around 40% of that increased early mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Nightmares lead to prolonged elevations of cortisol, a stress hormone closely linked to faster cellular ageing,” Otaiku added. “For those who frequently experience nightmares, this cumulative stress may significantly impact the ageing process. Additionally, nightmares disrupt both sleep quality and duration, impairing the body’s essential overnight cellular restoration and repair. The combined effects of chronic stress and disrupted sleep likely contribute to the accelerated ageing of our cells and bodies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the link between chronic nightmares and faster aging was consistent in participants of all sexes, ages, mental health statuses, and ethnicities. Biological aging was measured by looking at people’s &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.630186/full"&gt;telomeres&lt;/a&gt;, the protective end caps of chromosomes. Shorter telomeres are widely considered to be a sign of greater biological age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the research revealed weekly nightmares to more strongly predict early death than other widely known causes, including obesity, smoking, a bad diet, and low physical activity. Even less frequent nightmares, however, had their toll. Participants who reported having them monthly also experienced faster aging and increased premature mortality compared to those who reported rare or no nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As if living through terrifying experiences at night wasn’t bad enough, the associated health consequences highlighted in the new research carry important implications for how seriously we should take nightmares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if we’re being honest, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-birds-are-so-stuffed-with-plastic-you-can-hear-them-crunch-2000607662"&gt;the state of plastic pollution&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/industrial-waste-is-turning-into-rock-in-just-decades-study-suggests-2000595525"&gt;human-driven accelerated geological processes&lt;/a&gt; are probably not helping in that category, either.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;
