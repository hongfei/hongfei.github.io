    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggmsza005726qnasx7a1h0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first time, scientists say, they have evidence that using a biologic drug to remove sticky beta amyloid plaques from the brains of people destined to develop Alzheimer’s dementia can delay the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00042e6bw3f4t82o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers have been testing amyloid-removing therapies in a group of people who have rare genetic mutations that make it almost certain they’ll develop Alzheimer’s.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00052e6bq5s6s199@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study – which is small, including just a few dozen participants – is a follow-up to a randomized-controlled trial that found no significant benefits for people who were taking one of two amyloid-lowering therapies, compared with a placebo. The extension of the study doesn’t have a placebo control group and may be subject to important biases, so outside experts say the results, though striking, should be interpreted with caution.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00062e6btokheyja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s part of a research effort called Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer’s Network, or DIAN. The study participants like to go by a different name, though.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00072e6bjrvzhcuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We like to call ourselves the X-Men because we are mutants, trying to save the world from Alzheimer’s disease,” said Marty Reiswig&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of Denver, who has been participating in the trial since 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00082e6bi1wpryjz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00024-9/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, published Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology, found that the risk of symptoms was cut in half for a small subset of 22 patients who had not shown any problems with memory or thinking and had been taking an amyloid-lowering drug called gantenerumab for an average of eight years. The results achieved statistical significance in one part of the analysis but not in others, perplexing outside experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggnlkq00002e6bq7y1l1u6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “While this study does not conclusively prove that Alzheimer’s disease onset can be delayed and uses a drug that will not likely be available, the results are scientifically promising,” said Dr. Tara Spires-Jones, director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, in a statement to the media. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00092e6bwzdevmpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study authors believe&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that if people are started on therapy early enough and stay on it for enough time, it could forestall the development of the disease — perhaps for years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000a2e6bx0j6fbh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s “the first data to suggest that there’s a possibility of a significant delay in the onset of progression to symptoms,” said Dr. Eric McDade, a professor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis, who led the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000b2e6bcc4kp7r7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            McDade said this study has the longest-running data for any patients who started amyloid-lowering biologics while they were still free of symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000c2e6bg5b2g3qx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We think that there’s a delay in the initial onset, maybe by years, and then within those individuals that have some mild symptoms, even the rate of progression was cut by about half,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000d2e6b45bqvvm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The achievement of this long-hoped-for result comes with optimism but also panic, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000e2e6b98bjta93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research team says the meetings to review their National Institutes of Health grant funding have been canceled twice. Their grant has to be reviewed before they can be referred to what’s known as a council meeting, where funding decisions are made. If their grant misses a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;council meeting in May, the money for the study, which has been going since 2008, could run out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000f2e6bsnvxql9i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It ends up becoming a really difficult position we’re in and that the participants are in,” McDade said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000g2e6bhoqowejf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Patients could lose access to the study drugs, especially if they’re in countries where the medications haven’t been approved. If people can’t stay on the drugs, researchers may never find out how durable the benefit may be or be able to answer critical questions like for whom the medications work best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000h2e6bs5cywwui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keeping that group that has been on the amyloid drugs the longest is “absolutely critical,” McDade said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gibboj002j2e6bhube60nr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the 1980s, researchers studying the autopsied brains of people with Alzheimer’s discovered that they were clogged with sticky plaques made from beta amyloid proteins and toxic tangles made of a protein called tau. They theorized that removing these proteins from the brain might delay or even reverse the disease, and they began to hunt for therapies that could do that.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000j2e6bjj20uj9b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For decades, scientists have been testing a range of biologic medications that recognize and remove beta amyloid proteins, with mostly lackluster results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000k2e6b1wey9uys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In late-stage &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2304430" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; involving more than 1,800 people with early Alzheimer’s disease, one of these drugs, gantenerumab, slowed the progression of symptoms compared with a placebo, but it wasn’t a big enough benefit to pass a test of statistical significance, meaning the result could have been due to chance alone. It was considered a failed drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000l2e6bwagipwki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Meanwhile, two similar drugs — lecanemab, or Leqembi, and donanemab, or Kisunla — did meet the US Food and Drug Administration’s bar and were approved to treat people with Alzheimer’s who have mild symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000m2e6bl58q8z1w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both therapies are expensive, may cause brain swelling and, in clinical trials, delayed the progression of symptoms by months compared with placebos. The modest benefits mean some doctors and patients to shy away from using them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000n2e6bi8bfus9x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers testing gantenerumab in people with gene mutations that set them up for Alzheimer’s in the DIAN got permission from the FDA to continue using the drug for as long as possible. When they couldn’t keep the participants on gantenerumab any longer, they switched them to its sister drug lecanemab.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000o2e6bg8rpvqdi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sue, a study participant in Texas, has been in the gantenerumab arm of the trial since 2012. She joined the study shortly after she found out that she and three of her five siblings&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;had a gene mutation that made it almost certain they would develop early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ghcxxw00013b6m0lbw5vtj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of six children in her family, two brothers and two sisters have the mutation. One brother was tested but doesn’t have it, and another brother doesn’t want to be tested but remains free of symptoms. Two of her brothers and a sister developed symptoms around age 57. Sue, who at 61 is the youngest of her siblings,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000p2e6biuog6gim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m fine. I’m totally fine,” said Sue, who asked to be be identified only by her first name to protect family members who may also have the mutation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gj3vt300073b6mdmgnqdkg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her brothers, who were also in the trial but began taking the medication after they had developed symptoms, didn’t benefit as much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000q2e6bsa33wisv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When she started the study 13&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;years ago, she hoped she would contribute to scientific understanding of the disease. She has had 40 MRIs, 30 PET scans and more than a dozen lumbar punctures to collect her spinal fluid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ghehp200033b6mhbskl5z4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tests show that her brain and her thinking are normal. She gets “queen bee,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the top daily ranking,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;on the New York Times Spelling Bee game every day.

            “I still feel like, fundamentally, I’m doing it to help the science, but at this point, it’s helping me,” she said. “I truly believe that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000s2e6bwst8yjds@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sue believes the drugs have held off the disease for about four years for her. When the disease runs in families this way, she believes, there’s a pretty clear age when people start to decline, and she thinks the medication has pushed that back.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000t2e6bxp6h5eaa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After watching her brothers begin to decline, she worked with a financial planner to save as much money as possible and planned for an early retirement. Today, she’s still working part-time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000v2e6bbje5ihme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the study, the researchers recruited DIAN members who were cognitively normal or who had only mild symptoms, and who were in a window of time spanning 15 years before to 10 years after their estimated age of diagnosis. The researchers estimated the potential age at diagnosis by looking at the ages when other family members began showing symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000w2e6b2isyfd6i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the first phase of the study, participants were randomly assigned to take either gantenerumab, another amyloid-lowering drug called solanezumab or a placebo. That study ran from the end of 2012 to the beginning of 2019.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ghhfn500053b6mxdvtx4uf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the end of that study, researchers allowed participants who had finished it to continue on gantenerumab in increasing doses for three years. That extension ran at 18 clinical trial sites in seven countries. In 2023, the drug’s sponsor, Roche, discontinued development of gantenerumab after disappointing study results made it unlikely to be approved by the FDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000x2e6bgbj977vn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study released Wednesday reports the results of this extension, in which all the participants – 73 – who continued on the therapy knew that they were on the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000y2e6b9m6l2h6m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Study participants who took gantenerumab during either the double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the study or only in the open extension had a modest benefit. Their odds of developing symptoms were cut by about 20%, but the result was not statistically significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt000z2e6b02kcmg3c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For the 22 people who had been on gantenerumab the longest – an average of eight years – the benefit was larger and statistically significant. The drug cut their risk of symptoms by almost half compared with people who were in an observational arm of the study, in which researchers were monitoring the progress of participants but not treating them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00102e6br5cjfnaw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiswig, like many members of his family, carries a mutation in a gene called presenilin-2, which causes his brain to overproduce amyloid plaques. His relatives who carry the mutation begin showing Alzheimer’s symptoms between ages 47 and 50. Reiswig is 46.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00112e6b6bt0qca5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m staring the gun right down the barrel,” he said.

            His father also participated in DIAN in the observational arm but didn’t start the drug trial because he thought he was too sick to get any benefit. He died of Alzheimer’s in 2019, at the age of 66.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00132e6bt06q2pc4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s old for our family,” Reiswig said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00142e6bd8l82fz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For years, Reiswig resisted finding out whether he carried the mutation, but he did get tested in 2020. When he learned that he had it, “I punched pillows, and I cried really hard,” Reiswig said. “It was the worst day ever.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00162e6bec0a5479@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “eventually, you run out of tears,” he said. He and his wife decided “we’re just going to get busy living,” because he didn’t know how many good years he might have after the age of 47.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00172e6bshjwog2l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiswig started in the solanezumab arm of the study and switched to gantenerumab in the extension.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt00182e6bddzrutoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He hasn’t seen any symptoms, but he also doesn’t know whether he’s actually getting any benefit from the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001b2e6bral9wb7p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers who were not involved in the study said that even though it was small and not placebo-controlled, and the data is preliminary, it’s worth paying attention to.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001c2e6bidfsdxbr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the context of all we have learned about the value of amyloid removal in sporadic AD, these data are encouraging,” Dr. Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California, wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001d2e6btfi28fvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aisen led &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10559996/" target="_blank"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; that tested solanezumab in people who had amyloid in their brains but didn’t have any symptoms. That study found no benefit to taking the drug, compared with a placebo, after more than four years of treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8gioo1c002q2e6bkes6gyim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aisen believes that his study was negative because it tested a first-generation drug that didn’t remove amyloid as strongly as some of the newer ones do.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001g2e6bp538c9yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He’s now leading another study testing lecanemab in patients who don’t have symptoms. Because a long treatment period is required to see results in this stage of the disease, Aisen says they won’t have results until 2028 or 2029.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001h2e6bfwwey0u4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Much more needs to be done, and additional major studies are in progress,” he wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001i2e6bbhnk5nmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Others said the results from the latest research were hard to interpret, given the biases that probably exist in the study population.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001j2e6b0corohh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t think there’s a clear signal here that this is working,” said Dr. Michael Greicius, a professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford University who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001k2e6b55cm95x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grecius said it’s difficult to compare this group of 22 people who continued on gantenerumab to people in the observational study, because people in the extension were able to join only if they finished the placebo-controlled trial. People who dropped out of the phase 3 study weren’t eligible to participate, which means participants in the extension had to be relatively healthy and doing better in the first place.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001l2e6btzhqv8gd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are big caveats,” Greicius said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001m2e6bzxz4lpku@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He says the biomarker data included in the paper shows that as the researchers increased the drug dosage, they were able to remove more amyloid from the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001n2e6bj6jyge3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But other biomarker data is less clear. PET imaging scans, for example, didn’t show much of a difference in the amounts of tau protein in the brain, even after extended treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001o2e6bk5g06i93@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If there is a real effect here, Greicius says, it’s not likely to be a permanent one. “People are still progressing. They’re progressing more slowly than the control group.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001p2e6bv77jecsi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even though this data comes with a lot of uncertainty – or perhaps because it comes with so much uncertainty – Greicius says it’s even more important to continue the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001q2e6bezck9t7o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is an invaluable study population,” he said. “Continuing to follow them on treatment may provide the best test of the amyloid hypothesis that the field can undertake and stands to provide critical evidence either for or against it. This should be highly prioritized for continued funding.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001s2e6b42d04vm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Reiswig said it would be devastating if the study had to be stopped due to lack of funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001t2e6b0uw0e6bm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Personally, I’m terrified of that. I’ll be taken off of a life-saving drug and left to wait until symptoms begin to begin slowing the disease with Kisunla or Leqembi,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001u2e6bn2t6126x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He says he and the other DIAN participants have given decades of their lives to research, to developing a treatment, but then could be denied the drug they helped to test.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ggpfqt001v2e6b5ic0d3vt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Honestly, that feels criminal to me,” he said. “We are so close to preventing the world’s most tragic and expensive disease.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

I've done pretty much a little bit of everything,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also came out as gay in 1997. The year after I graduated high school. Mixed emotions in the family made it hard to stay at home," he continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp said he would panhandle for money after becoming addicted to drugs, and when that failed to produce the cash needed, he would steal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And I mean that's not acceptable anywhere you go. But it was a way of life, and when it becomes a way of life it's very hard to get away from it again, which was my issue,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also moved around a lot: living in tents or other covered areas along Airport Way, Industrial Way, under I-5 in North Seattle, under the helipad at Harborview Medical Center, an old pump house in Normandy Park, and Cal Anderson Park in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had so many friends out there on the streets that I knew where to go and, quite frankly, where I could get it for nothing. It came through a lot of tricking, and you, know prostituting and selling myself,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food, he said, was a day-to-day thing, and not nutritious since he had no way of cooking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've lost a lot of friends. I mean, death, just drugs and malnutrition because of homelessness. And it's sad,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Bouwkamp was diagnosed with HIV.  He was receiving care at Harborview Medical Center in 2019 when he really started showing signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he said his father died from a life of partying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got depressed and I stopped taking my medications. And I stopped really caring about my own health. I was a very rampant addict at that point.  I couldn't live without the drug,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illicit drugs combined with a lack of real drugs to treat his HIV and severe malnutrition brought Bouwkamp to the darkest time in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well, I was living outdoors. I was living at Cal Anderson Park across the street, and there's a Central Lutheran church. The guy that runs the place or does the groundskeeping kept coming up to the park and saying, 'You know, you're getting pretty sick there and you should go to the hospital,' and I never listened,” Bouwkamp explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time, he refused the help. But the man kept coming back day after day, as Bouwkamp said he got sicker and sicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And finally on May 5 of 2020, he walked up to me and said 'Eric if you don't let us call you an ambulance today you're gonna die right here. And we can't let that happen.' And he said 'Will you please let us call you an ambulance?' I broke down and I said, 'Yeah, I'm ready.' I said I'm ready to go.  I don't want to die out here,” Bouwkamp recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in his deteriorated state of being, Bouwkamp asked that the ambulance come without any sirens or lights and just quietly take him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp spent the next four months at Harborview.   On top of his HIV, doctors diagnosed him with a staff infection, strep, syphilis, secondary syphilis, and pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A very near-death experience that helped me turn my direction in life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp reconnected with his mother and sister when he was better, and that’s when he learned they had been searching for him two months before that ambulance ride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mom and sister decided to come to downtown Seattle and looked for me in Cal Anderson Park.  They stood right over me bickering if it was me or not. I heard their voices.  I was just too weak to respond, but they walked away,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said his mom still feels guilty, so he reassures her that it just wasn’t meant to be that day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this game of life, he says we’re given a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp eventually started making the choices he needed to be making. Now he is in an apartment, living independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gives great credit to the Bailey Boushay House in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since 1992 (they) have been giving care to people living with HIV and AIDS. In March of this year they informed me that I was being presented with a housing voucher that would pay my rent. At that point I moved into my apartment,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, with stable housing and his cat Einstein by his side, he has aspirations to become a nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm gonna get my certification for nursing assistant,” Bouwkamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, he plans to find a job and enroll in nursing school to become a registered nurse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bouwkamp also wants to inspire others, to hold out hope for change and never give up on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don't ever think that that there's no hope. Because there is, as long as you put your mind to it and you say 'Hey things are gonna be okay.' And you take that first step, put your best foot forward, and then let your other foot follow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing that, he said it’s important to see the people who really are trying to help and accept it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh man, in the last, say, ten years I've had at least a dozen people who've been willing to help me. But I didn't want help for myself because I wasn't ready. It was always extended to me.  People who are still experiencing homelessness and addiction, it can be lonely. It can be tough but fight for it.  Fight for yourself,” Bouwkamp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More information on the Bailey Boushay House and its services can be found &lt;a href="https://www.baileyboushay.org/" target="_blank" title="https://www.baileyboushay.org/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;HERE. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:47:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxNWXg2Nll4VUZ1cndnX19nWjVGMVVRS3NxTEVTcEoyMFZIX3dhaTdBY2FmZ05wcHVxTVk0a3drRFFyWXpJYVg5XzVpWnJCNHdBSEt2TW5Ld0VNeTJHTVpDWmxUbFlESERjWlNrVGJJSHc4UG5jTHNGZjB5YllLQXdsWmMzY0p1RDhVbVo2MUlGRWdTSnM4OTRxYmRaSmo2YkNCUmg2emFqTmE</guid></item><item><title>Trump Administration Considers Scaling Back H.I.V.

Trump unveiled a bold initiative to end the H.I.V. epidemic in the United States by 2030 by focusing on 57 jurisdictions with the most urgent needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The plan, which Mr. Trump announced in 2019 at a State of the Union address, surprised advocacy groups. But it was widely lauded, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;and successful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;By 2022, the plan had driven down new infections nationwide by 30 percent in adolescents and young adults, and by roughly 10 percent in most other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;This time around, the Trump administration’s stance on H.I.V. appears to be much the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services is now considering shutting down the H.I.V. prevention division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and shifting some of its activities to a different agency, according to federal officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The C.D.C. provides funds to states and territories for detecting and responding to H.I.V. outbreaks, prevention, syringe exchange, expanded testing in emergency rooms and education and awareness.

&lt;span&gt;According to the latest update from the Texas Department of State Health Services, 279 measles cases have been reported in the state. In New Mexico, 38 cases have been confirmed as of Tuesday, totaling &lt;strong&gt;317 cases across both states&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;In 2024, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed &lt;strong&gt;285 cases&lt;/strong&gt; nationally. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The cases have primarily occurred in &lt;strong&gt;Gaines County, Texas&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Lea County, N.M.&lt;/strong&gt;, which sit opposite each other on the Texas-New Mexico border. Of the cases in Texas, 36 have resulted in hospitalizations, while two people have been hospitalized in New Mexico.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;There have been two deaths, one in each state, related to the current measles outbreak, and both occurred in patients who were unvaccinated. The death in Texas was directly attributed to measles, while the cause of death for the New Mexican individual, who tested positive for the virus, is still being investigated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The numbers coming out of Texas have &lt;strong&gt;fluctuated&lt;/strong&gt; as more information is gathered, with there apparently being fewer breakthrough measles cases than initially believed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Texas health authorities found that after further investigation, three cases previously considered vaccinated were not. Two of the individuals had received a measles, mumps and rubella vaccine dose just one to two days before symptoms began, while the third case appeared to have been a reaction to the vaccine and was not a true infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It takes &lt;strong&gt;14 days&lt;/strong&gt; after vaccination for the body to develop an immunity to measles, and it is only at that point at which someone is considered fully vaccinated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hill</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 22:37:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOMlJ6cmFPTENvc1FaSHlYX2VTc2xhTV8xUzV2ZXdOdkJmMFEwSkdnVE9VZUpMMHhyLUFWNlJPd1pMVmlXWEtSOXB4NFpEM2kzU1ppMVVYYTdZQnZ6S0hEalRUb2RiUHpxSVk4akJYQlBlRXd2cGxUaEdybGIycFF5VHUydGFRdXRFdXBscmVHONIBlAFBVV95cUxOUTZaTm1GamJxazk0SXlCRUZFMDlkeGQ1bjJkTk1Md2RQUmpEQno1S0V0a1RVdGdULW1YRlhqaF9rTHlmTnlDRldZRWRVMG1DeXZsUnZCWVNTem9COUl3alNndE92LUNKNk43eDlLNEhhOFhmNkw1cDVKaExTMDFQUVVQTExpQW9rN0FTQnk3cERmaWdQ</guid></item><item><title>An apple a day keeps tinnitus at bay (and so might coffee) - Boing Boing</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNSU14ajBPWV9ONlRxUTZrQ2tOTENNUTUzYWQtR0g0a01HbUNqTWFXbGpKZ0UzWnFPQ3BVZHVfVXl1a0hzUFE1N0ZoUGQ5RXprMHpHQVRmOVhQd1VuY0lxLTFMeFBsLU1hYWFGMG0yMnNHUnF1aVVObWVjWTk3bDRBY3NpbTR5azlPRzVsU0h0VDItcVhGbmlEcnotUdIBoAFBVV95cUxNOFFZbmxJU2VwenZCSHIwU1c3d3VqT3RlOVo1Q0FCbFRwTW0wZW5pWkZ6VFk5VWN0NHY4RjNkZW1IUzVqMFBrMWIxNlBhNEFVZ2FhWXZmMjZXOFJvNFU5bllsU3F5b1laU1FNWnhZNVFmdm5acVkzQ1JlWDFmUEc5aE5ZZkpTeExaczR0Rk5fTEtYdUpZaktjRmJMQVk4QjVj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Boing Boing</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:11:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNSU14ajBPWV9ONlRxUTZrQ2tOTENNUTUzYWQtR0g0a01HbUNqTWFXbGpKZ0UzWnFPQ3BVZHVfVXl1a0hzUFE1N0ZoUGQ5RXprMHpHQVRmOVhQd1VuY0lxLTFMeFBsLU1hYWFGMG0yMnNHUnF1aVVObWVjWTk3bDRBY3NpbTR5azlPRzVsU0h0VDItcVhGbmlEcnotUdIBoAFBVV95cUxNOFFZbmxJU2VwenZCSHIwU1c3d3VqT3RlOVo1Q0FCbFRwTW0wZW5pWkZ6VFk5VWN0NHY4RjNkZW1IUzVqMFBrMWIxNlBhNEFVZ2FhWXZmMjZXOFJvNFU5bllsU3F5b1laU1FNWnhZNVFmdm5acVkzQ1JlWDFmUEc5aE5ZZkpTeExaczR0Rk5fTEtYdUpZaktjRmJMQVk4QjVj</guid></item><item><title>As measles cases rise across the US, who may need another vaccine dose? - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPR1IxWmlPWGZ3dWRKaGxtSEJlODZyemo4T213NUt3UC1iaGI1eXBVNWxZYUxFSFd1MHRGaU9ZQ09IWUZDcjc1RjZJTTRxUzFJUWR5alpwSXJSYnlBcjdJY09ha0NsUXlUeXpVZkRsZE9mQUNsWXdaWDNueTZFMUZZVmhMOEZRekRiN1Zv0gGQAUFVX3lxTE9TUHRsbEhXUGY2UlFULUk0ZW5rRGNkMjJjVlg3eGFRVkg2dzZzQ3AtU3lDa1ZfV2tLNWxpbVc5T2tEVjNBYXBmbzQ4YTBpTk9YQ0Nrc0wxRTNaTFBQNVBHbWdMYlFPNmZDX2g5S1FSUlZBSkxWd0tmTlZQLVY4RGl0TDVwLS1BMUtNLUxiOEVodQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;As measles cases continue to spread across the United States, many Americans may be asking themselves if they need a measles vaccine booster to enhance protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An outbreak in western Texas has &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;grown to 279 cases&lt;/a&gt;, mostly among those who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown.

One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Most vaccinated adults don't need another vaccine dose, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

"But if you looked at the epidemiology of those outbreaks, it was in people who never got a vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He went on, "So it wasn't that the immunity faded, that the vaccine wasn't good enough. It's an excellent vaccine as a single-dose vaccine. The problem was people didn't get it.

These people would be eligible for re-vaccination with one or two doses, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"So, the first measles vaccine licensed in the U.S. was in 1963 and it was an inactivated vaccine," he told ABC News. "That inactivated vaccine had two consequences to it. One, it did not produce protective immunity and, number two, it led to -- when people did get exposed and infected -- it led to atypical measles, and that can be very severe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Poland said, at the time, there was also a live attenuated measles vaccine, similar to what is used today "but it was not very attenuated or weakened, and so it caused a lot of side effects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;He explained that to decrease side effects, physicians would give a patient a vaccine and then a shot of immunoglobulin, or antibodies. While this decreased side effects, it also tended to kill the vaccine virus, not giving people adequate immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;For those who were vaccinated with the single-dose vaccine similar to the one used today -- or received the MMR vaccine -- Offit said another dose is likely not needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;In 1989, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians recommended children receive a second MMR dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Offit and Poland said anyone who has received two doses of the MMR vaccine does not need to receive another dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;If someone is unsure if they are immune to measles, they should first try to find their vaccination records. If they cannot find written documentation, there is generally no harm in receiving another dose of the MMR vaccine, according to the CDC.

It's a better choice than chia seeds,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also explained that just two tablespoons of basil seeds has 15 grams of fiber in it - more than half of what your daily intake should be! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Spinach can help reduce inflammation and support muscle recovery (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Spinach &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You probably already know that you want to incorporate leafy greens into your diet, but did you know that spinach in specific is a great choice to eat every day?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Spinach is packed with magnesium, iron and antioxidants, helping reduce inflammation, supporting muscle recovery and promoting relaxation - all of which aid in better sleep,' nutritionist and&lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://realnutritionnyc.com/about/"&gt; registered dietician Amy Shapiro&lt;/a&gt; said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plus, spinach is a non-greasy vegetable - meaning that it won't cause you any stomach issues.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Yogurt  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://activbuilt.com/about-us/"&gt;Registered dietician Reda Elmardi&lt;/a&gt; emphasized the importance of gut-healthy foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most people don’t realize that digestion impacts everything - mood, immunity, weight,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why yogurt is on Elmardi's list of foods to eat every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yogurt is rich in probiotics, calcium, and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Trust me, your gut will thank you,' Elmardi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Berries &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether you're more of a strawberry person or have an inclination toward blueberries, it doesn't matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Blueberries, raspberries, strawberries - they fight inflammation, boost brain function, and keep blood sugar in check. Bonus: they taste amazing,' Elmardi said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that adding berries to your everyday diet will help you age better and keep your heart healthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Because of side effects, safety concerns and/or lack of research, experts recommend avoiding red yeast rice, chaparral, arnica and cat’s claw supplements if you have arthritis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While some supplements may be helpful, eating an anti-inflammatory diet and being physically active are key for managing arthritis symptoms. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always talk with a health care professional before taking new supplements to ensure they’re safe and align with your health needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Arthritis is an inflammatory condition that causes swelling and tenderness in the joints. And, contrary to its reputation, it can occur at any age. No matter your age or stage of life, if you live with this condition, you’re not alone if you’ve wondered whether dietary supplements could provide some relief. According to an older study, about 63% of people with arthritis report taking supplements (compared to 49% of the general population).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s reason to give some of these over-the-counter products a try. Multiple supplements have &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-for-arthritis-8611187" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;research to support&lt;/a&gt; their effectiveness in reducing the pain, stiffness and soreness that come with this condition. But not every pill or powder marketed for arthritis is a magic bullet. In fact, some supplements could even have a negative effect. “People often think of dietary supplements as natural and benign, but they can have some serious adverse effects,” says&lt;a href="http://pcosnutritionistalyssa.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt; Alyssa Pacheco, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “In some cases, they can actually be counterproductive. It’s always a good idea to talk to your health care provider before starting any supplements.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re seeking relief from arthritis symptoms, think twice before taking any of these supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-red-yeast-rice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Red Yeast Rice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people who take red yeast rice use it to&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7836633/high-cholesterol-diet-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; lower cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;—but some turn to it as an arthritis supplement. “This is due to its high content of calcium and magnesium, two nutrients important for bone health,” says Putzi. However, red yeast rice’s positive impact on cholesterol may be tempered by a negative impact on joint health. “Similar to statin drugs, red yeast rice may cause muscle pain and joint discomfort,” Pacheco says. Putzi adds that red yeast rice may also interfere with the safety and effectiveness of certain prescribed medications.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-chaparral"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Chaparral &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The name “chaparral” might sound familiar if you hail from the desert Southwest. This plant, also known as &lt;em&gt;Larrea tridentata&lt;/em&gt;, is a shrub native to California, Arizona and northern Mexico. Because it contains components naturally high in antioxidants, it’s sometimes used as an agent of relief for arthritic inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In the 1990s, though, the use of chaparral as a dietary supplement led to dozens of hospitalizations for emergency liver transplants and cirrhosis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Long story short, this one’s a no-go for arthritis (and other health conditions, too). “Consumption in even small amounts can [trigger] significant health problems, particularly liver toxicity,” says Putzi. “No human studies have been conducted to support its usage, as the risk greatly outweighs any potential benefit.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-arnica"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Arnica &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Arnica can be applied to the skin to ease sore, aching joints. One study found that its pain relief effects were comparable to those of ibuprofen in people with arthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But Putzi says that, for some people, a topical application could cause skin problems like a rash, itching or dryness.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While such side effects from topical arnica may be bothersome, oral arnica has even more serious drawbacks. “Arnica should not be taken orally unless directed under the close supervision of a doctor, as consumption, especially in concentrated amounts, can lead to a multitude of serious adverse effects, some of which can be fatal,” says Putzi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-cats-claw"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Cat’s Claw &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cat’s claw is a popular herbal supplement that’s sometimes used to relieve pain associated with arthritis. “Cat’s claw has a high level of anti-inflammatory properties, which is thought to be the reasoning behind potential benefit for those with arthritis or inflammatory joint issues,” says Putzi.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, research on cat’s claw for arthritis is limited and outdated. For example, one older study found cat’s claw to be helpful for reducing pain during exercise but found no significant change in swelling or pain at rest.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Another older study found the supplement to be effective for reducing pain initially, but the benefits faded after eight weeks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to being older, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health points out that studies on cat’s claw are not well-designed or adequately powered to reach meaningful conclusions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additional reasons to skip this one? Putzi says that side effects like nausea and upset stomach are possible, and the supplement may interact with certain medications, including those for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-tips-for-managing-arthritis"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Tips for Managing Arthritis &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;  When it comes to managing arthritis, supplements aren’t your only option. In fact, there are many lifestyle changes you can make to help manage your condition. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat an anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/strong&gt;. Because arthritis is an inflammatory condition, prioritizing foods with anti-inflammatory properties can help manage symptoms. Consider a Mediterranean-style or other&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291733/the-best-worst-foods-for-your-joints/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; featuring whole grains, healthy fats, lean proteins and plenty of produce. “Foods such as salmon, sardines, berries, oranges, kiwis, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, nuts, seeds and olive oil are great foods to incorporate more routinely into your diet,” says Pacheco. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit highly processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;. On the flip side, lowering inflammation also has to do with what you &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;eat. As much as possible, limit your intake of added sugars and highly processed foods, which may increase inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving&lt;/strong&gt;. Regular physical activity can strengthen the muscles around arthritic joints, decrease joint pain and improve your mood.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether it’s going for a walk around the block after dinner or caring for your lawn, try to carve out at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Each case of arthritis is unique, so a supplement that works for your friend might not work for you. And, despite clever marketing, some supplements aren’t a good idea for arthritis at all. If you’re looking for a natural approach to treatment, you can always start by adjusting your diet and incorporating more movement into your day. Before you snag a supplement, talk to a health care professional first. They can provide personalized advice about which products are safe and align with your health needs.&lt;br&gt;

while taking phentermine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Brady Henderson, 52, from Atlanta, Georgia, was desperate to lose weight and he managed to get a prescription for the appetite suppressant phentermine, sold under the brand name Adipex-P&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The interaction of the two substances can lead to a range of potential health concerns including an increased heart rate, impaired liver function, excessive drowsiness, dizziness, and impaired coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In rare cases, phentermine has also been known to cause paranoia and other psychotic symptoms due to its structural similarity to amphetamines such as meth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on Mr Henderson's case, Dr Colin Haile from University of Houston's Drug Discovery Institute, told DailyMail.com: 'Adipex-P, or phentermine, can significantly increase blood pressure and lead to dizziness and other symptoms described. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Further, phentermine should not be combined with alcohol because it can mask its depressant effects and people can end up drinking too much.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Henderson claims he was not warned about these dangers during a consultation at a local weight loss clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he says he should have done his own research around the drugs before taking them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I take some of the blame because I should have known better,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To make matters worse, Mr Henderson was already suffering from high blood pressure but he claims this was also ignored during his consultation and he was able to get the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Adipex-P - which are taken by mouth once daily, typically in the morning - were previously one of the go-to weight loss medications approved by the FDA before the advent of GLP-1 receptor agonists such as Wegovy and Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Adipex-P is generally not recommended to patients with high blood pressure as it stimulates the central nervous system and can worsen cardiovascular conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are now warning patients to be vigilant as the demand for weight loss medications skyrocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medical bariatrics specialist Dr Jada Moore-Ruffin, who did not treat Mr Henderson, says she has seen people sourcing weight loss drugs online, from friends and 'from people who are not in the medical field'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She warns people: 'Don't just trust your body to anybody. Don't give yourself over to someone that can't really support you for the long game.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Haile notes that Adipex-P is a cheaper alternative to GLP-1 agonists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he also highlights that they work differently and have different potential side effects and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medic told this website: 'The GLP-1 agonists are all the rage in the US right now for weight loss and would seem to be a better alternative because they do not increase blood pressure however they are very expensive and probably not an option for the average person unfortunately.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following his unnerving experience with Adipex-P, Mr Henderson has now changed his approach to losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm doing it the natural way this time - you know, going to the gym, watching what I eat,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:57:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxPbWxySU5SakdGSXJNaTY2YWQ1Wnl5WnU1NU9Lb010dGtmaTBsaHIwbjZ4OG9IQjNEN1p1aVJVM0ZycF9JZnl4U3Q4UFVibjFBR1Q4T3c2eTFsOXIwQXhnakZQd2xGazRYUVJWZHM3UGJPNEU3WHgwa0dfam1MQ2ZBc0dTVFNCVlpPRlhiRjBLUmlUN0VaejE2aEh0Mzh2QdIBowFBVV95cUxPLXVqenFlSlA1TC1GN2k4dE5HR25FazRSZzhUZEdpLWRKWGVrS3U1M1BmTm5kanQwUmFNQjFxd3RJUEZMNXlnNzg3cWs5ZU9fNkl5OG1HRlNVWkFBX3lHVUxkaHRTU00xVUk0am9MRjZrRVYyTDFsR3JpX1U5UWx5akdqM1N5d2hMOVd1M1hBYUJSVlltVjRVOGFySk1iYUN4Nk5Z</guid></item><item><title>4th measles case confirmed in NY.

Kathy Hochul confirmed Wednesday that a fourth person has been diagnosed with the measles in New York this year, and called on clergy, activists and other “pillars of our communities” to help disseminate accurate information about the effectiveness of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Help us encourage everyday New Yorkers, who want only the best for their families, to get the vaccination, because there are numbers that are still deeply troubling,” Hochul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City and state data shows only about 81% of New York 2-year-olds have gotten their first dose of the MMR vaccine, even though the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get it between 12 and 15 months. Hochul noted that in the vaccination rate is much lower in some counties. A rate of 95% is needed for herd immunity, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hochul said the four New York cases reported this year, including three in New York City and one in Suffolk County, are not related to one another and are “not inherently a cause for concern.” New York state had 14 cases of the measles last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hochul said she wants to “sound the alarm” early, given the state’s current vaccination rate among young children and ongoing measles outbreaks in parts of the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest measles case was reported in a New York City adult who recently returned from traveling abroad, said Chantal Gomez, a spokesperson for the city health department. Gomez said people who may have been exposed to that person are being notified. Officials gave different accounts as to whether the person was vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three previously reported cases were in children who were younger than the recommended age to receive the first dose of the vaccine, according to the local health departments for New York City and Suffolk County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With ongoing outbreaks in Texas and New Mexico, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 300 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in the United States so far this year, more than the number reported in all of 2024, according to the CDC. But Hochul said she’s particularly concerned about an &lt;a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/toronto/local/peel/article/another-confirmed-case-of-measles-in-peel-region-public-exposure-possible-in-mississauga/#:~:text=Public%20Health%20Ontario%20(PHO)%20says,outbreak%20there%20and%20in%20Ontario." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;outbreak in Ontario, Canada&lt;/a&gt;, since many upstate residents travel there frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hochul lamented that “in the year 2025, we’re still debating whether vaccines are safe.” She took the opportunity to call out Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was recently appointed secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as the “nation’s leading vaccine skeptic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent op-ed&lt;/a&gt; for Fox News, Kennedy acknowledged that vaccines “not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity.” But he also said the “decision to vaccinate is a personal one” and said “good nutrition” is “a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These comments, along with the suggestion that supplements like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/west-texas-measles-outbreak-families-forego-conventional-medicine-vacc-rcna194795" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cod liver oil&lt;/a&gt; can be used to treat the measles, have &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; among public health experts, who say the focus should be on widespread vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 19:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxQX2JxZnpRdVVlTEx3VXVXN2R0dGVYdWJhSTRUb1phR2hzQU9FN1BVUFhaa1lxNS1TSFBmZVNZVWdYTV9INDlORkZ3SThQVHhGX3dNOTZqSzJ5dngteFZyWUxxSlpqcldGWmZ0XzhiUll1aTRHYnItZktPMjNHZ2UtR1BoRUlZWlBYMjhFMU9mam5oZEk1ZFdQYjgwQlpVeDlHXzFMeWxDNnhNZw</guid></item><item><title>CDC issues dengue fever warning for spring, summer travelers - The Hill</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxPOG5OVFhTYnJxVjl2dFgwSWV6RTlUMFVQUDlUMHBmeENlVHJxencyMTdvM21HMXNRY3B5SXRMbFlpd0MtLXZySHVrclZFd19RaExRRTgybGhpMkRSbm00Zm1xN2haZFZBSFptYXk1amt0TERrSVlZelRsYkx3UkZrd3dRTjBDd9IBiwFBVV95cUxNdEM3Y1FCUDUybHJScWViUnZvWEQyR0dheXc3WGNnRnVxWGVZVlVBWU5hS0NlOTI2QnJFM3BlSFNnWnRSMzl1Y0ZqSjhhdzFDZ2xwemZxUlRmWThMMk1XLU9ERXI1VkN1Nm85RUNCelJ1YkNjMm9zTmZSa2g2b3hQZHdrbUdBUDVXazRZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__text | body-copy | flow"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dengue fever cases have been rising among U.S. travelers and are expected to climb this year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00523.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to a warning&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A “record number” of dengue fever cases were identified among U.S. travelers last year — a total of 3,484, an 84 percent increase compared to the year before.  &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“This trend is expected to continue with increased dengue activity in endemic areas in 2025,” the warning from the CDC reads.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dengue activity remains high in some parts of the United States and around the world, and transmission of the disease remains high in the Americas and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dengue is more easily spread during the warmer months, placing spring and summer travelers at an increased risk of contracting the disease.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cases of the virus have increased during the past five years, particularly in the Americas, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There were 7.6 million cases of the virus reported to the WHO in 2024 alone, including 3.4 million confirmed cases, more than 16,000 severe cases and more than 3,000 deaths from the virus.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Puerto Rico, dengue fever cases have been above the outbreak threshold since February of last year. A public health emergency was declared in March 2024 and remains in effect. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The island reported 6,291 cases of dengue in 2024, with more than 52 percent requiring hospitalization and 13 resulting in death, according to the CDC.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A dengue outbreak also was declared in August 2024 on the U.S. Virgin Islands and remains in effect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A total of 208 cases were identified in 2024 and 30 in 2025 as of early March. The highest numbers of travel-associated dengue cases in 2024 were reported in Florida, California and New York, according to the CDC.  &lt;/p&gt;

Researchers analyzed data from 546 university students and found that this link is influenced by sleep quality, alcohol consumption, and mindfulness levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evening chronotypes had poorer sleep, consumed more alcohol, and exhibited lower mindfulness compared to morning chronotypes.

The data included self-reported information on the students’ sleep patterns, mindfulness, rumination tendencies, alcohol use, and depression and anxiety levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study confirmed that people with an evening chronotype were at a notably higher risk for depression and that the association could be explained by differences in mindfulness, sleep quality, and alcohol consumption. On average, evening chronotypes had poorer sleep quality, higher alcohol consumption, and acted with less mindfulness than morning chronotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was limited in its ability to prove cause-and-effect because of its cross-sectional design which relied on data at only one time point. In addition, the findings may not apply to age groups outside of the university students included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those caveats in mind, the authors conclude that interventions aimed at mindfulness, sleep and alcohol use might have the potential to reduce depression risk, amongst young adults in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add: “With many young adults’ experiencing poor mental health, these study findings are particularly important—many young adults tend to stay up late and the results point to how interventions could be implemented to reduce their risk of depression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9d6d7dcc9cbdccacaf9c9d5d6ca97d6cbde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hanna Abdallah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hanna Abdallah – PLOS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mindfulness mediates the association between chronotype and depressive symptoms in young adults&lt;/a&gt;” by Yatagan Sevim G et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness mediates the association between chronotype and depressive symptoms in young adults&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronotype influences risk of depression, with evening-types at higher risk, although the reasons for this are uncertain. Potential mediating factors include mindfulness, sleep quality, rumination, and alcohol consumption, but research is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explored the role of these factors in the association between chronotype and depressive symptoms amongst young adults, using cross-sectional data collected from a university student sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; =  546).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evening-types had significantly higher levels of depression symptoms, poorer sleep quality, and lower levels of ‘acting with awareness’ and ‘describing’, as well as higher rumination and alcohol consumption.

The fifth-anniversary commemorations on March 9th, which had been designated a “Day of Reflection” by the government, were dignified but modest. In London relatives of the deceased threw carnations into the Thames, as a piper played a lament. Around them, joggers plodded, tourists gawped and drinkers toasted the first pint of the day in glorious spring sunshine. The television schedules—“Songs of Praise”, “Gladiators”—went undisturbed. This is a sentimental country, where Armistice commemorations seem to grow bigger each year and new statues are erected to local heroes. But mention the pandemic, the biggest calamity in living memory, and you will be met by a wince and a change of subject.

At the end of 2022, 1.7 million women in this age group were prescribed stimulants such as Adderall and Ritalin for ADHD, compared to 1.2 million prescriptions in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s been an overall jump in ADHD prescriptions since the pandemic and the rise of telehealth. The new analysis, published in JAMA Psychiatry by researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, also looked into how the medications are being misused — that is, taking more of the drugs than prescribed, taking them at times that differed from what the doctor ordered or using medication from someone else’s prescription&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers used data from more than 83,000 adults, ages 18 to 64 who participated in the 2021-2022 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Information on prescriptions came from the 2019-2022 IQVIA Total Patient Tracker and National Prescription Audit New to Brand databases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They found that the prevalence of misuse of prescription stimulants among women aged 35 to 64 was significantly lower than it was among men of the same age (13.7% versus 22.0%). Middle-aged women also misused their medications less than younger women (13.7% versus 36.8%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Three types of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/prescriptions-adhd-drugs-spiked-pandemic-cdc-report-finds-rcna77430" target="_blank"&gt;stimulants are approved for ADHD&lt;/a&gt;: amphetamine (Dexedrine, Adderall); methamphetamine (Desoxyn); and methylphenidate (Ritalin).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Overall, just over a quarter of people with prescriptions for ADHD medications reported misusing them. About 9% had what is called &lt;a href="https://library.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/pep20-06-01-001.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;prescription stimulant use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, or addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;People taking an amphetamine or methamphetamine were more likely to misuse than those taking a methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The researchers aren’t sure why there was such a big increase in older adult women being prescribed stimulants for ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It is a very large increase that I can’t fully explain,” said a study co-author, Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director at the National Institute on Drug Abuse&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The size of the increase in middle-aged women is surprising, said Aaron Brinen, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Girls with the neurodevelopmental disorder may not be diagnosed because their symptoms are often more subtle than those exhibited by boys, who are more likely to show symptoms of hyperactivity or impulsiveness, research indicates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I wonder if it speaks to women feeling more empowered to talk about what they are needing and about their struggles in life,” Brinen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They may realize that they had ADHD as children but were never diagnosed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Girls are more likely to be overlooked because the way they express ADHD isn’t likely to be captured by teachers,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Brinen has female friends who weren’t diagnosed and treated until they were in their 50s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was the first time in their lives that they felt functional,” he said. “It’s a tragedy that it took so long.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Untreated ADHD can lead to feelings of failure and depression, Brinen said. “People think of them as not trying, but they are constantly trying and meeting disappointment,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Brinen suspects women with ADHD are less likely to misuse the stimulants because their prescriptions make life easier. They don’t get high from the stimulants, they just feel more normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Women with ADHD sometimes manage to get by until they hit a stage where life becomes more difficult and challenging, said Mariely Hernandez, a clinical psychologist who specializes in addiction and ADHD and is a postdoctoral research fellow in the department of psychiatry at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The symptoms of ADHD might become a much bigger problem when women have children, Hernandez said. “The executive function needed to manage a family may exceed their cognitive resources, especially when the children are young,” she added. “Then their symptoms become too impairing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hormonal status can also affect the severity of symptoms, Hernandez said. “We see a lot of women diagnosed at menopause,” she said, adding that low estrogen levels in a woman with ADHD can lead to a dopamine deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Dopamine underlies our reward system,” she explained. “If you don’t make enough or aren’t able to properly utilize it, you won’t be able to focus as well. Women will say, ‘I can’t live like this. I want to be evaluated.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:27:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPdWszb1o5QmE3bEZHUHVsQ0lPVUs2eVZ3X2YxTzY1UHl0NlllTGVHVjNmNHZkdTFzeFd6T2FMU0Z1Y2RSLUd6U1hseXlGVnluWFdzMktXUDFNc3k3YjdKS1BodnZTdVJfTUE0WktybW1GZ2g4dmpRdldVd0hwRzFuQzBnNVJIYTE2RmNNT2x5VFQ1Y19lQzVfalhmZVlDUTJhQnZrWklIaWJIck1Yc1HSAVZBVV95cUxNaDhEUmhBX09FQXpvR1otYS13amlBMFg2T3N3TXM1elhOZTdNS3pLTl9RelI1M1RtdHNRVFVSRWlQNlBZWDNONjdkSUVsS242SERtNFRkdw</guid></item><item><title>10 Common Foods With Microplastics and Ways to Reduce Exposure - CNET</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPbVk1MGRrVVd4MUw4aVVOamEzanlVVVIwTzJ4RnVvbEhURUtZbHZCWURiZDRjTlpwaWZhbkV4am14QmZkR281NHR1YmVka1k4cDROQ2NIT2wxS1c5ektMTmlfRmgtUkM1ekpIUVZZNmlFMEhNbUFCSVRCY1JGYm1MTTVsZXdYYmlrcXJ4WTdkci1kS19qQVlmYWRobjZVenBkM0VV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;Some researchers have estimated that people consume between &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31184127/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;39,000 and 52,000 microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; each year. If we add how much we take in when breathing, that number goes up to 74,000 to 121,000. Recently, a new study &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/03/health/plastics-inside-human-brain-wellness/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a plastic spoon's worth of tiny plastic shards in human brain tissue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;Microplastics are everywhere. They're in our water, our clothes and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/microplastics-in-your-kitchen/" target="_self"&gt;our kitchens&lt;/a&gt;. Experts have also found them in the foods we eat. OK, that sounds bad, but &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;bad is it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no officially established 'safe' or 'unsafe' level of microplastic intake. It makes sense to want your exposure to be as low as possible," Dr. Joseph &lt;a href="https://www.mercola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Mercola&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified family medicine osteopathic physician, said in an email.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics can enter our food due to contamination where the food was grown, raised or processed. Mercola explained that using plastic mulch and plastic seed coatings in agriculture, and irrigation with contaminated water, are among the various ways microplastics can end up in food. Plastic packaging, utensils and containers are additional sources.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the US Food and Drug Administration, current &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-foods" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;evidence doesn't suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the levels of microplastics in food are a risk to us. However, you still might want to minimize how much microplastics you passively consume. These are the most common foods that contain microplastics, and the measures you can adopt to reduce your plastic intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Top 10 foods in your diet that contain microplastics &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Seafood &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant ways plastic particles end up in our food is through single-use plastics that break down and find their way into waterways and soil. When they reach the oceans, they end up in our seafood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microplastics are then taken up by plankton and mistaken for food by fish and selfish," Mercola said. "The tiny particles accumulate in the flesh ... then end up on our plates." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published by Portland State University discovered a variety of microplastics in &lt;a href="https://www.globalseafood.org/advocate/researchers-detect-microplastics-in-the-muscle-tissues-of-oregon-seafood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;180 out of 182 tested seafood&lt;/a&gt; samples. Microfibers are the most common type of microplastic present, but this isn't the only type that ends up in our oceans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Tea bags &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A plastic called polypropylene is often used to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10389239/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;make tea bags&lt;/a&gt;, and even if you choose paper tea bags, there can still be microplastics in them. The issue is that when the bags contact hot water, microplastics may be released into your tea.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona discovered that polypropylene tea bags can release plastic &lt;a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/-1345830290613.html?detid=1345940427095" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;particles in the billions&lt;/a&gt; and nylon and cellulose tea bags can release them in the millions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it: &lt;/strong&gt;You don't have to stop drinking tea.

A University of Queensland study found that for every half cup of rice, there are &lt;a href="https://stories.uq.edu.au/news/2021/instant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punchinstant-rice-packs-a-plastic-punch/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;3 to 4 milligrams of plastic&lt;/a&gt;. If you use instant rice packets, that number is four times higher, at 13 milligrams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it: &lt;/strong&gt;The study found that &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/why-you-should-think-twice-about-eating-leftover-rice/" target="_self"&gt;washing your rice&lt;/a&gt; can reduce plastic contamination by 20% to 40%, though it's worth noting that the study used filtered water for rinsing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Salt and sugar &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you top off your dinner with a sprinkling of salt, you're getting an unintentional side of microplastics. It's hard to outrun salt. It's in almost everything we eat, and our bodies need a certain amount of sodium to keep our fluids and electrolytes balanced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, one study found that &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b04180" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;90% of the 39 sampled salt brands&lt;/a&gt; worldwide contained microplastics. This likely results from environmental contamination and the production and packaging process, which includes plastic. Microplastics have also been &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157523001357" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;found in sugar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it: &lt;/strong&gt;To cut down on exposure to microplastics in your salt and sugar, you can buy them packaged in glass or cardboard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Yuliia Kokosha/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Bottled water &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottled water is one of the most well-known sources of micro and nanoplastics. One study estimated that there are about &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2300582121" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;240,000 plastic particulates&lt;/a&gt; in a liter of bottled water. Most plastic water bottles you buy at the store are made from polyethylene terephthalate, or PET, plastic, so it wasn't surprising to see it represented. Plastic particles break apart when bottles are squeezed or exposed to heat. And PET plastic isn't the only type of nanoplastic researchers &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/bottled-water-can-contain-hundreds-thousands-nanoplastics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; in plastic water bottles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking tap water from a stainless steel or glass container can reduce your risk of ingesting plastic particles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Honey &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not expect your &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/is-honey-actually-good-for-you-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_self"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt; to harbor microplastics, but it does, even if it's in a glass jar. Microplastic fibers can be traced back to bees and pollution. One study exploring whether microplastics ingested or carried by honeybees were then incorporated into hives found that bees can continue the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123000805?__cf_chl_tk=MSXhDg.kFtGbZ0xj.BqEf_1RKejtd_VJPcTtz_7IQmw-1740000824-1.0.1.1-zSGcmly1meJNCQ1shRWNbSkegK_60v3.YZLjpZlvflc" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;dispersal of microplastics&lt;/a&gt; through honey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; Buying honey from local beekeepers who often use more-natural and sustainable harvesting methods may reduce the risk of microplastic contamination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Fruits and veggies &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vegetables and fruits are an essential part of a balanced diet. Unfortunately, they can also contain microplastics. One study that sampled &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/put-in-extra-effort-to-wash-these-12-pesticide-prone-fruits-and-vegetables/" target="_self"&gt;fruit and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120305703" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;apples were the most&lt;/a&gt; contaminated fruit and carrots were the most contaminated vegetable. How does this happen? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Plants have been shown to uptake micro- and nanoplastics from soil through their root systems, thereby contaminating the edible portions," Mercola said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many grocery stores also package fruit and vegetables in plastic to keep them fresh. According to the FDA, there isn't &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/environmental-contaminants-food/microplastics-and-nanoplastics-foods#:~:text=Health%20Effects%20Information&amp;amp;text=While%20some%20studies%20suggest%20there,a%20risk%20to%20human%20health." target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;enough evidence&lt;/a&gt; to determine that microplastics from plastic food packaging migrate into food. But Mercola suggests you avoid it as much as you can anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; Wash your fruit thoroughly, peel when possible, and opt for local or organic produce. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Animaflora/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Proteins &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study from researchers at the Ocean Conservancy found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749123022352" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;88% of vegetable and animal proteins&lt;/a&gt; contain some level of microplastics. But highly processed proteins, like plant-based alternatives, fish sticks or chicken nuggets, harbor the most microplastics, suggesting the microplastic contamination partly comes from &lt;a href="https://oceanconservancy.org/news/its-not-just-seafood-new-study-finds-microplastics-in-nearly-90-of-proteins-sampled-including-plant-based-meat-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;food processing&lt;/a&gt;. The study found that breaded shrimp had an average of 300 microplastic pieces per serving. Plant-based nuggets had 100 pieces per serving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food processing isn't the only way microplastics can get into these protein sources. Microplastics are in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666154324002953" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;animal feeds&lt;/a&gt; and in the environments where animals are raised. Plant-based alternatives can be contaminated through the soil or irrigation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to avoid it:&lt;/strong&gt; After reading that, you may be wondering what protein you should eat. The reality is that more research is needed to know the exact levels and their impact on our health. Our bodies need protein to function, so getting enough is important, no matter which source you choose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/an-easy-protein-visual-guide-to-help-you-reach-maximum-muscle-gains/" target="_self"&gt;An Easy Protein Visual Guide to Help You Reach Maximum Muscle Gains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; What do microplastics in food mean for you? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do all foods contain microplastics? I can't say for sure. I can tell you, however, that more research is needed to understand just how eating foods with microplastics affects us. Still, though the long-term health effects remain under investigation, microplastics are something to watch out for and guard against if you can, as Mercola explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ingested microplastics have been found to accumulate in the circulatory system and various organs, including the brain, where they can cause inflammation and tissue damage," said Mercola. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other potential side effects are hormonal imbalances caused by the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151227/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;endocrine-disrupting chemicals&lt;/a&gt; found in plastics. Microplastics can also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123021929" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;absorb other&lt;/a&gt; environmental toxins and introduce them into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no established safe level of microplastics, and we can't completely outrun them: They're everywhere and in everything. But it's a good idea to minimize exposure where you can. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt; Expert tips for reducing your intake of microplastics &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can cut down by following this advice:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be careful how much shellfish you eat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Shellfish like mussels, oysters and scallops have higher levels of microplastics, so don't overdo it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid food-storage containers made of plastic&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This is one of Mercola's biggest suggestions, because of the "plasticizing chemicals" in the plastic. BPA and phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals that can transfer from plastic to food. They're fat-soluble, so it happens most easily with fatty foods. It's best to store foods with fat in glass containers. You can store dry foods in plastic if you need to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid plastic-wrapped foods&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This can be easier said than done, but it's something to strive for in areas where you can make the switch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get rid of plastic kitchen utensils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;From the spoons we use to stir our sauces to the cutting boards we use to chop our vegetables, if they're plastic, you're ingesting microplastics. A good rule of thumb is: Anything plastic that comes in contact with your food should be swapped out for ceramic, glass, stainless steel or wood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help address the overall issue of microplastics in food, you can install a filter in your clothes-washing machine. If you can afford it, a special filter will catch microfibers before they pollute water systems. The &lt;span class="c-shortcodeCommerceLink"&gt;&lt;a href="https://planetcare.org/?srsltid=AfmBOorMia6_Q8gvv3v2g19v1pLOo9ZQkxOVxh7z6Qrdfl72EcmM6BFG" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" data-location="BODY"&gt;PlanetCare 2.0 microfiber filter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; starts at $125. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still have a lot to learn about microplastics and their long-term implications for our health when ingested. It might be hard to hear they're in so many of our foods, but that shouldn't deter you from eating well. A &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-food-sources-for-every-vitamin-you-need/" target="_self"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt; of protein, fruit and vegetables will ensure your body has enough fuel to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/medical/8-things-youre-already-doing-that-benefit-your-health/" target="_self"&gt;function and thrive&lt;/a&gt; -- microplastics or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 18:27:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPbVk1MGRrVVd4MUw4aVVOamEzanlVVVIwTzJ4RnVvbEhURUtZbHZCWURiZDRjTlpwaWZhbkV4am14QmZkR281NHR1YmVka1k4cDROQ2NIT2wxS1c5ektMTmlfRmgtUkM1ekpIUVZZNmlFMEhNbUFCSVRCY1JGYm1MTTVsZXdYYmlrcXJ4WTdkci1kS19qQVlmYWRobjZVenBkM0VV</guid></item><item><title>Are we torturing our sleeping selves?

It leads to inflammation and  scar tissue binding to and stiffening organs, causing a pulling sensation and sharp, shooting pains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pain &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-13031195/womans-struggle-stage-four-endometriosis-lifesaver-product-women-suffering-period-pain.html"&gt;can be unbearable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for some women. A build up of scar tissue can block the fallopian tubes, as well as disrupt the hormone balance necessary for ovulation, making it impossible to conceive. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The impact on a woman's quality of life can be enormous, from keeping her from working or attending school and socializing with friends, to racking up thousands in stressful debt for treatments and potential cures.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bhavini Shah, a general practitioner in the UK who works for digital health platform Lloyds Pharmacy, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250319/GP-reveals-seven-ways-to-relieve-endometriosis-symptoms.aspx"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘There is no known cure, and treatment is focused on managing pain symptoms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, studies and anecdotal reports from millions of women have helped doctors zero in on certain treatments that make a noticeable difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details tips from doctors for relieving endometriosis pain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;There is no cure for endometriosis. Current treatments include painkillers, heating pads, and in some cases, surgery to burn off excess tissue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Heat &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heat is one of the most powerful pain-relieving tools, according to gynecologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah and other physicians recommend a hot water bottle or heated wheat bag - a fabric pouch filled with natural wheat grains that can be heated in a microwave or oven - to be placed on the pelvic area to relax the muscles there and improve circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A heating pad is the most trusted home remedy for endometriosis pain. It loosens and soothes tight muscles in the pelvic area, reducing painful cramping and restoring blood flow to the area, which eases painful inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While a heated wheat bag is an easy find on Amazon and other retailers, a rice sock is also an excellent do-it-yourself source of relief. Take a clean sock, fill it with uncooked rice, and microwave it for about two minutes. Place it gently on the pelvic area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Michael Reed, a gynecologist in Beverly Hills, California, said: ‘Heating pads and warm baths are solid go-tos, but in my practice, I’ve seen a mix of medical, lifestyle, and alternative approaches make a real difference for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Pain relief often requires a combination of methods, as what works for one person may not work for another.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Painkillers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over-the-counter pain relievers are often prescribed and effective, such as ibuprofen, especially when taken the day before one’s period or pain is expected to begin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Tylenol has been shown to help alleviate pain as it’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In endometriosis, tissue that grows outside the uterus produces high levels of compounds called prostaglandins, which play a major role in inflammation and pain all month long, not just during a woman's monthly period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The excessive production of these compounds leads to stronger and more painful uterine contractions, resulting in severe menstrual cramps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ibuprofen is more effective when taken before the pain becomes severe because it blocks enzymes that help produce prostaglandins before they trigger pain and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to Dr Reed, over-the-counter meds ‘don’t always cut it.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Endometriosis causes tissue, similar to the lining of the uterus, to grow outside of the uterus, causing inflammation and pain. It can also cause bowel problems, fatigue, and infertility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told DailyMail.com: ‘Some patients find better relief through hormonal therapies such as low-dose birth control pills, hormonal IUDs, or GnRH agonists, which suppress estrogen — the fuel for endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In cases where pain has a neuropathic component, nerve pain medications can also be effective.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Hormone therapy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Shah added: ‘Some hormonal treatments can stop the ovaries from being stimulated, meaning that production of estrogen stops. Therefore, women might experience side effects causing a “menopause-like” state.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Birth control pills, patches, or rings with estrogen and progesterone can help to stabilize and suppress the natural hormonal surges in the menstrual cycle that stimulate growth of endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Progesterone-only treatments, such as pills, hormonal injections, and intrauterine devices (IUDs), can help reduce the growth of endometriosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, medications that target gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a brain hormone that stimulates the ovaries, are also effective in managing the condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both options work by altering hormone levels to slow the progression of endometriosis and alleviate symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Amitriptyline &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Amitriptyline is another medication that may help alleviate pain. Primarily known for treating depression, the drug has pain-modifying properties by altering the body's perception of pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Amitriptyline is another medication that may help alleviate pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Primarily known for treating depression, the drug has pain-modifying properties by altering the body's perception of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It does this through its action on raising levels of serotonin and norepinephrine, which help regulate and block pain signals from reaching the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also particularly effective at alleviating nerve pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;TENS machine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dealing with the symptoms may include trying even more advanced treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One such treatment uses a TENS machine (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation), which helps ease aches and pains, including back and shoulder pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The machine delivers mild electrical impulses through electrodes placed on the skin, which interact with the nervous system to modulate pain perception. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By overwhelming the nervous system with non-painful stimuli, the TENS machine reduces the brain's ability to perceive pain signals from the affected area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A TENS machine (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) is a non-invasive device that uses mild electrical impulses to relieve pain. It works by placing electrodes on the skin near the painful area, which deliver electrical currents to stimulate the nerves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-large health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;Surgery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another method is a laparoscopic laser to blast the tissue and break it up. Depending on the patient, this surgery may have to be repeated because endometriosis is a chronic condition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;New scar tissue and lesions can form on organs around one to two years after surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the tissue has attached itself to other organs, like the colon or bladder, a similar surgery would be performed with a broader team of doctors to ensure that no healthy tissue is damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jessica Rich, a gynecologist in Florida who specializes in endometriosis, told DailyMail.com: ‘The general focus should be on treatment of the disease and leaving the normal organs in place, but some women who are no longer trying to get pregnant and have tried other strategies may opt for hysterectomy or larger procedures.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some aesthetic treatments often used in cosmetic gynecology also show promise for symptom relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Reed added: ‘CO2 laser therapy and radiofrequency treatments, often used for vaginal rejuvenation, can help improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue healing in patients with chronic pelvic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections, which use the body’s own growth factors to encourage tissue regeneration, have also been explored for pelvic pain and discomfort.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-large mol-style-bold health-ccox"&gt;Physical therapy &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors also say women underestimate the power of movement and physiotherapy, which is designed to strengthen or relax pelvic floor muscles, reduce pain, and manage anxiety&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say women underestimate the power of movement and physical therapy, which is designed to strengthen or relax pelvic floor muscles, reduce pain, and manage anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The inflammation, pain, and scar tissue from endo can lead to pain that spasms in the pelvic floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Dr Ritch, ‘Working with a specially trained pelvic floor physical therapist can help to decrease some of this scar tissue and spasms to help reduce pain in conjunction with other endometriosis treatments.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doing some gentle activities when one feels like curling up into a ball on the couch, like yoga, stretching, or leisurely walks, can also increase blood flow and reduce cramping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Reed added: ‘Endometriosis pain is no joke—it’s like your uterus is throwing a tantrum, and unfortunately, it doesn’t come with a mute button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Ultimately, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for endometriosis pain, but relief is possible.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-1ba14940-04d7-11f0-b93a-8304302db766" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14515811/doctor-relieve-debilitating-symptoms-common-conditition-women-endometriosis.html"&gt;

We got onto the topic of–what else–politics, and my friend talked about how pervasively the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/aug/02/everything-youve-been-told-is-a-lie-inside-the-wellness-to-facism-pipeline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;alt-right&lt;/a&gt; has seeped into her sphere, which once felt like a bastion of, if not leftist ideas, at least anti-conservative ones. As the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-robert-f-kennedy-make-america-healthy-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;US government &lt;/a&gt;starts pushing fringe health theories into the mainstream,  two recent TV shows–&lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Common Side Effects&lt;/em&gt;–also explore this world and its dark side. Both shows make space to think about a world that can sometimes feel too big to wrap your head around, but they also raise the volume on dangerous wellness conspiracies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81637595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a recent Netflix series that intersperses a fictionalized account of fraudulent wellness influencer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Gibson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Belle Gibson&lt;/a&gt; with two actually fictional characters: Milla Blake, a woman who believes she cures her cancer through juicing and coffee enemas (and who seems based on a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/mar/01/jessica-ainscough-australia-wellness-warrior-dies-cancer-aged-30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;real-life influencer&lt;/a&gt; who ultimately died of cancer), and a woman with breast cancer named Lucy who becomes a fan of Belle’s work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(The following contains some general spoilers for the plot of &lt;/em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belle falsely claims to have been diagnosed with various cancers that she treats with a diet that ultimately becomes the worldwide phenomenon The Whole Pantry (while I didn’t recognize Belle’s name when I first started the show, I absolutely remembered the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Whole-Pantry/dp/0718180410/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1D-WX9UTLx3UwZlVnLWuEg.BP49G0vtBHSVXaHONBIB5i7ZrbOactWCUwTBGq7BOBQ&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;qid=1742234285&amp;amp;refinements=p_27%3ABelle+Gibson&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cookbook&lt;/a&gt;.). Her fraud comes to light following reporting by Australian newspaper &lt;a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/revealed-the-age-stories-that-exposed-belle-gibson-s-lies-20250213-p5lbqj.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Age&lt;/a&gt;, which first exposed that donations The Whole Pantry promised to various charities and individuals were never paid; the scrutiny ultimately forced Belle to admit that she had never had cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show jumps between multiple stories and timelines in a way that can be a bit confusing (the waters were further muddied for me given my feeling that the main actresses all look a bit alike) but which works to paint a complex picture of the world of wellness influencers. Milla, unlike Belle, earnestly believes that her non-medical cures saved her from having to have her arm amputated. When her cancer returns at the height of her fame, it doesn’t just threaten the media empire she’s built, but her entire sense of herself and her belief in the things she’s devoted her life to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy, meanwhile, is just a regular person. Her partner, who is one of the journalists investigating Belle, tries to stand by her through her treatment, but they grow estranged as Lucy’s fascination with Belle draws her deeper into alternative medicine. Unlike Belle and Milla, both of whom financially benefit from their experiences, we see the damage the wellness sphere does to Lucy financially, medically, and interpersonally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt; also shows how its protagonists’ actions affect other people in their lives. When Milla first decides to pursue alternate medicine instead of having her arm amputated, we see her parents struggle between supporting her and wanting her to get the care the doctors recommend. Later in the series, her mother is diagnosed with cancer; Milla insists she eschew traditional medicine. Lucy’s partner is motivated to look into Belle as much by his profession as he is wanting to free Lucy from Belle’s grip. Belle’s partner Clive is in a unique position; he loves Belle and her son, and he also clearly loves the swanky lifestyle her fame affords him. But he struggles as Belle’s story starts to fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I appreciated most about &lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt; is the way the multiple storylines complicate what might otherwise be another grifter tale in the vein of &lt;a href="https://play.max.com/movie/1d7c48f8-8064-46d7-a3b8-bb7b91fc2056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Inventor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81008305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inventing Anna&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While plenty of wellness gurus are obviously frauds, there are surely more people who are drawn to that space because they honestly believe in what it has to offer, and who become more than just participants because they earnestly want to help people. Through the show’s stories, we see how people value more than just the juices and health outcomes; the wellness world provides a sense of purpose and a narrative for the world that helps people make sense of themselves and their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their book &lt;a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/derek-beres/conspirituality/9781541702981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspirituality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Derek Beres, Matthew Remski, and Julian Walker write that “People are drawn to both marginal spiritual communities and conspiracism because 1) they are attracted to the idea of knowing something necessary for survival, 2) that no one else knows, and 3) that they can share with other kindred spirits.” When Milla’s cancer returns, she meets a woman who offers her &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/do-not-use-black-salve-dangerous-and-called-many-names" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;black salve&lt;/a&gt; for her tumors; the woman tells her she can’t legally sell Milla the salve “because the government are scared of its potential to destroy the big cancer industry.” &lt;em&gt;Conspirituality&lt;/em&gt; calls this an “an imagined fall from organic grace… as folk medicines were discredited by the captains of new pharmaceutical industries, and as spiritual rites were disenchanted by academics and bureaucrats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This strand in &lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt; would be right at home in another recent show, Adult Swim’s &lt;a href="https://aftermath.site/common-side-effects-adult-swim-max-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Common Side Effects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.That show follows Marshall, who has discovered a mushroom that cures all diseases, and his attempts to evade the government and pharmaceutical companies that want to get their hands on it. In one way, it flips &lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt;’s health frauds on their heads–there really &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a miracle cure out there “they” want to keep you from, and we see it have real results throughout the show. But unlike &lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt;’s characters, Marshall seems to have no desire for riches and fame; he just wants to save humanity with his discovery, while powerful forces try to stop him. He is, in a sense, portrayed as the exact kind of hero so many wellness influencers seem to believe they are, or at least present themselves as. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both shows deal with themes that are incredibly relevant today. It is indeed true that government and medical bureaucracy prevent people from getting the care they need and create dehumanizing systems. But the wellness world’s brand of conspiracy often fails to take the &lt;a href="https://aftermath.site/united-healthcare-luigi-mangione" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;right aim&lt;/a&gt;, inventing a shadow cabal that wants to push drugs and harm people instead of focusing on capitalism’s role in the health care industry. This thread feels especially notable now that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;RFK Jr&lt;/a&gt;. runs the Department of Health and Human Services. RFK’s “MAHA” (“Make America Healthy Again”) agenda whiffs of health conspiracies and wellness hacks that would be right at home in both shows’ worlds: vaccine skepticism, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;non-medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; for diseases, and various stances and theories that &lt;a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/gay-frogs-and-atrazine-why-the-alt-right-likes-rfk-jr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;appeal to the alt-right&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it might sound good on its face–a hypothetical priority on &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze391y17z7o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthy food&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-says-government-ignores-chronic-disease-misguided-rcna190042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;be a good thing, if they weren’t pushed by a guy who &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;drinks raw milk&lt;/a&gt;–but leaning into this as a country isn’t going to lead to some kind of wellness utopia; it’s just going to &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-measles-outbreak-grows-279-cases/story?id=119905598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;kill people&lt;/a&gt; and spread more misinformation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt; both humanizes and takes aim at this, &lt;em&gt;Common Side Effects&lt;/em&gt; seems to revel in it, at least so far (the show’s season isn’t over yet). As games journalist &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iantothemax.bsky.social/post/3ljbt6imz3s2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ian Walker&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, “It's just a mysterious mushroom from the rain forest instead of a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-58170809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;horse dewormer&lt;/a&gt;.” What does it mean for both shows to explore themes that have long caused real harm, and are gearing up to cause more widespread harm now? Both shows make space to think about these issues apart from the horrors of the news; as fiction, they can look more deeply and explore more facets than a news story that has to prioritize accurate information above all else. But they also turn up the volume on a confusing world that’s already making a lot of noise in the public sphere, potentially giving it more validity in some people’s eyes. And while I don’t believe fiction is duty-bound to give moral instruction–neither show needs some kind of “remember: this is bad” placard–does &lt;em&gt;Common Side Effects&lt;/em&gt;’ thriller conspiracy as humanized through its animation style and writing, or the ways in which &lt;em&gt;Apple Cider Vinegar&lt;/em&gt; paints Belle as compelling, add fuel to the fire of these conspiracies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I enjoy both shows a lot, including indulging in a certain brand of escapism they offer by letting me enter a version of our current world that doesn’t lead to babies getting measles. And &lt;a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt; is, of course, one way we explore and make meaning out of our lives, and the accelerated rise of the wellness sphere is something that’s urgently present in the lives of Americans right now. Ultimately, maybe anything that takes wellness claims out of the mouths of the people who peddle them has value, especially these days.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aftermath</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 17:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9UUDhoQXphQUo4cl81SnlLcVp4c0ZmMHRfZ0RoZExfdEV6OHlIcnMxajFoeDJOcXFiREwtSXotYjF6RktrR2Nnb01yLTFhSGlPbjdFdVd1N29RVHYtNWNVTkRFSGF3S1JXRGI2djFyMA</guid></item><item><title>Generic Cancer Drug Shows Promise in Treating Autism, Sparks Hope for Future Prevention - VINNews</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxPRVByd3oyQm1YR1p1R1I4UnYzb0RrdGV1OWc4cGg5cTVTc1BEU1ByOVhMOHFDSGFNLTU0WVdTZGFyUFRUVkRORU5yMWpWRkowSXoxRjZ6cHRTMmxpSm8yZDdhRV9wLXFreThuQkswdW5OSTFNaFMzU29ObmxmYUVzMDBrdS0wZ3M4UE5VZkdwbS1xWFdVVTNnM05XMmR3Z1RqdG42TUtxZWtUNUc3WUxsZVlkSzlsSFNfaHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-582705" class="post-582705 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-breaking-news" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK – A generic cancer drug, leucovorin, has shown promising results in improving autism symptoms, including enabling nonverbal children to speak for the first time. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist from Arizona, has spent over a decade studying the drug’s effects on children with autism, gathering evidence that it could both treat and potentially prevent the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong class="whatsapp-promotion-mobile"&gt;

&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucovorin, commonly used to alleviate chemotherapy side effects, is derived from folic acid, a crucial B vitamin. Frye discovered that many children with autism suffer from a condition called cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), which can be treated by leucovorin, bypassing the blockage caused by autoantibodies that impede folate transport to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, around one-third of children showed significant improvements in language skills, and some even began speaking after starting the drug. Frye has also observed improvements in social interactions and reduced repetitive behaviors. The drug’s side effects are minimal, making it a potentially game-changing treatment for children with autism.&lt;br&gt;

While leucovorin is not a cure, Frye believes it accelerates the effectiveness of other therapies, such as speech therapy and applied behavior analysis. He is also exploring the potential for preventing autism by treating parents who carry the folate receptor autoantibodies, offering new hope for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frye is testing a new form of leucovorin and hopes it will receive FDA approval for autism treatment. In the meantime, he encourages parents to discuss its potential with their child’s doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

Just consume it more often throughout your day,” said &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zumpano-julia-4757482a"&gt;Julia Zumpano&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="P2RCLOVBY5ELJD2GCJ4ROAFQTM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/168462/nutrients"&gt;Spinach&lt;/a&gt; is chock full of vitamins, minerals and &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-nutritional-science/article/flavonoids-an-overview/C0E91D3851345CEF4746B10406908F52"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt;. Also, the superfood is a solid source of fiber, which may keep people satisfied longer, and in turn, make between-meal cravings less likely, said &lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/dana-hunnes"&gt;Dana Ellis Hunnes&lt;/a&gt;, a senior clinical dietitian for UCLA Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="N7VVHPVOSBB6VI4AO5LATNHOZE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7551485/"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/10/03/eat-vegetables-first-food-sequencing/"&gt;meal sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, in which vegetables and proteins are eaten before carbohydrates, can reduce spikes in blood sugar. (Blood sugar spikes &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5912158/" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to cravings&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for carbohydrates and sugar, experts said.) A recent review of 11 studies &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/27697061.2022.2161664"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that people who consumed carbohydrates at the end of a meal had lower blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRJ5QIVQJVEO7LBLK7GDLRZ6PI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter how spinach is eaten, however, it has not been shown to retrain taste buds, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUVTGOQUE5E57HXP6EB4OATHUE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In any case, the social media trend is encouraging people to eat more spinach, which is “awesome,” Zumpano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HDNCNFNFBJETLAANDYHXR5FHOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are some risks, while rare, associated with eating too much spinach, though there is no consensus on how much is too much. A serving size is 2 cups of raw spinach or 1 cup of cooked spinach, &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov/eat-healthy/vegetables" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NUFLHHBI6BDSBL5BNZ3JEJGM24" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Spinach is rich in &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminK-HealthProfessional/"&gt;vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, which may interact negatively with some prescription blood thinners. Also, spinach can be high in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/17/3201"&gt;oxalates&lt;/a&gt;, compounds that bind to minerals such as calcium and can exacerbate kidney stones in people who are prone to them, said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/theresa-gentile"&gt;Theresa Gentile&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Cooking vegetables can significantly reduce the oxalate content, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15826055/"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NHGWZI2FAVCKXPNYDRKFWMZKUU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As for the nutritional value, Gentile said that while raw spinach has more lutein and vitamin C, cooked spinach better brings out the bioavailability of other vitamins such as vitamin A, beta carotene, thiamin, riboflavin, magnesium and calcium.

Those cells were then modified in a lab to go after the tumor target, called B7-H3. About a month later, he started getting infusions of the T cells, delivered directly into his cerebrospinal fluid. Once reintroduced back into the body, the T cells replicate, creating a surge of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/melanoma-new-immunotherapy-cancer-treatment-rcna60468" target="_blank"&gt;cancer-fighting immune cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-03/250308-brain-tumor-ch-1546-ced0ef.jpg" alt="The Nielsen family."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Gavin with his parents and younger sister, Aurora.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Jovelle Tamayo for NBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The results of Vitanza’s early-stage &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03451-3" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; were published in Nature Medicine in January. In addition to Gavin, 20 children and young adults with DIPG got CAR-T therapy every two to four weeks. The median survival was about 20 months — nearly double the expected prognosis. Three patients, however, are still alive 3 ½ to 4 ½ years after starting their treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gavin is one of those patients. Now 6 years old, he’s lived four times longer than doctors initially predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s the biggest miracle that I could ever ask for, just to have time,” Ashlee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gavin is still getting CAR-T infusions every two to three weeks. Sometimes, for about 12 hours after the infusions, he has headaches, nausea and vomiting.

Many are aggressive or diagnosed at a later stage, leading to a poor prognosis. A 26-year-old woman's excruciating pain in her stomach was dismissed as celiac disease. By the time her scheduled scan came through, her symptoms had intensified and she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, Business Insider reported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Colon cancer in young&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer cases in young people have witnessed a sharp rise in recent years even as the overall rate of the deadly cancer is on the decline. Over the years, the average age of early-onset colorectal cancer has decreased. A decade ago, it was in the 40s, but now it has dropped further to the 30s and 40s. In the case of younger colon cancer patients, an inherited genetic mutation could be behind the malignancy. However, lifestyle factors like eating an unhealthy diet and a sedentary lifestyle may also contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The young lady's painful predicament&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannin Desroches, 26, was full of life and leading an active lifestyle, eating healthy and clean diet. When she started experiencing stomach pain after meals, she was initially told by her doctor in Ontario that it was likely a gluten allergy, and asked her to get blood work done, a Business Insider report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she booked her own CT scan. However, due to a long waiting time, it took almost a year to schedule a scan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she ate smaller snacks to avoid abdominal discomfort, she experienced symptoms like constipation, pencil-thin stools, and felt a nagging pain in her left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what I ate, I was in excruciating pain, pretty much yelling for help," Desroches, told Business Insider. She feared that she with these symptoms, she wouldn't be able to make it to the scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was eventually admitted for an emergency colonoscopy in early 2024, however, by that time the tumour in her colon got so big that the procedure couldn't be finished. She told the outlet that The GI specialist "couldn't get the camera through."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, she was given a three-year life expectancy. She now wishes colonoscopies were more routine for people under 45, the recommended minimum age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I had a colonoscopy done, I could have caught this even in stage 2 or 3," she said. "That's the most frustrating part to me, knowing that I shouldn't have to be here fighting stage 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Another nightmare unfolds&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches was able to book an MRI in April 2024 with the help of a friend. A blockage was found and a colonoscopy the next morning confirmed it was a tumour. She subsequently underwent a six-hour surgery, which removed part of her large intestine where the tumour was located, her right ovary, 13 lymph nodes, and part of the membrane lining her liver. The large tumors on the liver could not be removed for the fear of liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning after she woke up with her husband at her side, the surgeon told her she had stage 4 cancer and advise her to start egg retrieval from her left ovary right away, if she wanted children as the cancer may spread quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember just almost disassociating," Desroches said. She and her husband broke down once the doctor left. "We just had a good cry together and just bawled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches opted for immunotherapy, a targeted treatment designed to help her immune system fight cancer, in combination with two chemotherapy drugs. However, chemotherapy took a troubling turn. During her 13th round of oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug, she suffered an anaphylactic shock, forcing her to stop the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably the scariest feeling I've ever felt, knowing that my body is literally shutting down on me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results have been far from encouraging as in the CT scan in January her tumours didn't shrink. The next one is scheduled for April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Desroches is exploring other options. The hepatic arterial infusion pump she needs is only available in Canada through a clinical trial she doesn't qualify for. While the procedure is more common in the US, her oncologist estimates it could cost over $500,000, making it financially out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She has started a GoFundMe page for her cancer treatments and looking for options in Europe. "It's very overwhelming, but when you're in fight-or-flight mode for your life, it doesn't matter," she said. "You just do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Desroches and family are trying to stay positive. In October, she married her husband, Cody Desroches, at a beachside wedding in Jamaica. "I would do anything to go back to that day," she said. They're also planning to have kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after surgery, Desroches met with a fertility doctor to start the egg-freezing process right away. "It was the worst pain I've ever experienced," she said, describing intense nausea from hormone injections and dry-heaving so violently she feared her surgical staples would tear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her procedures, she knows she’ll never be able to carry a child but hopes she and her husband can one day have one through surrogacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, picturing a future is still hard for her.

&lt;p&gt;Missing sleep might feel like a minor inconvenience, but its effects go far beyond tiredness, including sleep deprivation that can impact both physical and mental health. &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-reveal-what-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" data-type="link" data-id="https://scitechdaily.com/researchers-reveal-what-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-dont-get-enough-sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SciTechDaily&lt;/a&gt; reports that ongoing research links sleep deprivation to memory impairment, cognitive decline, and long-term health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; Sleep plays a crucial role in removing brain toxins, regulating hormones, and maintaining immune function. Yet, many people trade sleep for work, entertainment, or social habits, unaware of its deeper consequences. The full impact of sleep deprivation is more alarming than most realize.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgetfulness, Slow Thinking, and Poor Decisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When sleep-deprived, the brain struggles to store memories, process emotions, and make rational decisions. Research has shown that individuals who don’t get enough sleep experience impaired memory retention, making it harder to recall information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function slows down, affecting problem-solving and learning capabilities. Additionally, emotional instability increases, leading to higher levels of stress, irritability, and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study from The University of Hong Kong (HKU), led by &lt;a href="https://neurotlee.hku.hk/people/" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://cbh.hku.hk/people-tatia#:~:text=Prof.,American%20Board%20of%20Professional%20Neuropsychology." rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Tatia M.C. Lee&lt;/a&gt;, found that poor sleep directly impacts the glymphatic system—the brain’s waste removal network. This system plays a crucial role in clearing out toxins and harmful proteins that accumulate throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep quality, brain activities, and glymphatic functioning are related. Understanding how sleep quality influences the glymphatic system and human brain networks offers valuable insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning age-related memory change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt; Explains &lt;strong&gt;Professor Lee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; When sleep is disrupted, this process is hindered, leading to an increased risk of neurological diseases. Professor Lee explains that sleep quality, brain activity, and glymphatic functioning are closely linked, and understanding these interactions can provide valuable insights into age-related memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The HKU study observed older adults using functional MRI scans and found that poor sleep deactivates the glymphatic system, resulting in memory impairment and cognitive decline. According to Professor Lee, this discovery highlights the necessity of maintaining efficient glymphatic functioning to promote healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results clearly reveal the effect of sleep on the human brain’s network through the glymphatic system, which in turn affects memory performance in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lee adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Without proper sleep, the brain becomes overwhelmed with waste, making individuals more vulnerable to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impaired memory is a common complaint among older adults with poor sleep quality – Lee notes. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our results provide a novel perspective on the interplay between sleep, the glymphatic system, and multimodal brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constant Fatigue and Low Energy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you wake up feeling exhausted despite spending hours in bed, it is a clear sign that your sleep is not restorative. &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/bill-gates-admits-i-thought-i-was-one-mistake-away-from-death-with-microsoft-until-the-late-90s/" data-type="post" data-id="73393"&gt;Chronic sleep&lt;/a&gt; deprivation results in persistent daytime drowsiness, making even the simplest tasks feel draining. Physical energy diminishes, reducing motivation for exercise and overall productivity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2021 study revealed that sleep deprivation significantly affects balance and coordination, increasing the likelihood of falls and injuries. The brain requires sufficient rest to maintain motor function, and without it, movements become clumsy and reaction times slow down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Chronic sleep deprivation disrupts the brain’s ability to regulate emotions, leading to mood swings, irritability, and heightened stress levels. It also increases the risk of developing anxiety and depression. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Studies have found that &lt;strong&gt;80%&lt;/strong&gt; of people with depression suffer from sleep disturbances, and individuals with insomnia are twice as likely to develop clinical depression.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weakened Immune System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A lack of sleep weakens the immune system by reducing cytokine production, the proteins responsible for fighting infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt; As a result, sleep-deprived individuals fall sick more frequently and take longer to recover from illnesses. Chronic inflammation also increases the risk of long-term diseases, including autoimmune disorders and cardiovascular issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation negatively affects the body’s hormonal balance, particularly those responsible for regulating hunger and metabolism. Levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates hunger, increase, while levels of leptin, which signals fullness, decrease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; This imbalance leads to uncontrollable cravings for unhealthy foods, particularly sweets and carbohydrates, which contribute to weight gain. Additionally, higher cortisol levels, caused by stress from sleep deprivation, further promote fat storage, particularly in the abdominal area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart Disease and High Blood Pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep is directly linked to cardiovascular diseases. Studies show that individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours per night have a higher likelihood of developing high blood pressure (hypertension), irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias), and coronary artery disease. The long-term effects of sleep deprivation increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Driving while sleep-deprived is just as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that drowsy driving is responsible for thousands of car crashes, injuries, and deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After 20 hours without sleep, cognitive function declines to the equivalent of having a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.08%, which is the legal intoxication limit in most U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Ways to Fix Your Sleep Cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is crucial for long-term health. Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day—even on weekends—helps regulate the body’s internal clock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reducing screen time at least an hour before bed is essential, as the blue light from devices suppresses melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol in the evening also improves sleep quality, as both substances can interfere with the sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creating an environment conducive to sleep is equally important. Keeping the bedroom cool, dark, and quiet enhances sleep quality. Regular physical activity during the day can also contribute to deeper and more restorative sleep, but it’s best to avoid exercising too close to bedtime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Lastly, long daytime naps—especially those exceeding 20 minutes—should be avoided, as they can disrupt natural sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If lifestyle adjustments fail to improve sleep quality, consulting a sleep specialist may be necessary to rule out underlying sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin, the "cuddle hormone" that's known for its involvement in bonding, may also play a role in putting early pregnancies on pause, a study of lab animals finds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research in mice shows that the hormone can put embryos in the earliest stages of development into a kind of hibernation state. Once triggered, this process, called "diapause," might allow a mouse mother to delay a pregnancy at a time when resources are scarce — such as while she is still nursing a previous litter of newborn mouse pups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that oxytocin had an influence on this was a little bit of a surprise," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/moses-v-chao" target="_blank" data-url="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/moses-v-chao" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Moses Chao&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diapause, in general, is a bit of a mystery. The phenomenon naturally occurs in marsupials, such as kangaroos and possums, and in at least 130 species of mammals, including mice and bats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might even occur in humans — it's a difficult phenomenon to track in most human pregnancies, but a few scattered reports from in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics suggest that, in rare cases, embryos transferred into the uterus might hang out for weeks before actually implanting in the organ. In &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8671285/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8671285/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one case reported in 1996&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it took five weeks after embryo transfer for the pregnancy to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/pregnancy-may-speed-up-biological-aging-study-suggests" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/ageing/pregnancy-may-speed-up-biological-aging-study-suggests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pregnancy may speed up 'biological aging,' study suggests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not clear how long diapause can last, Chao said, nor is much known about how embryos enter this state of suspended animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VSLiwCgDLBuB5ciCKswfTg" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-VSLiwCgDLBuB5ciCKswfTg slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study first author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/froemke-lab/members" target="_blank" data-url="https://med.nyu.edu/research/froemke-lab/members" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jessica Minder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a graduate student at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, was interested in oxytocin's role in diapause because the hormone is also known to be involved in embryonic development and nursing in mammals, including humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minder and colleagues began the work by introducing male mice into the enclosures of female mice that had just given birth, allowing the rodents to mate while the females were still nursing their first litters. The researchers found that the resulting pregnancies lasted about a week longer in still-nursing female mice than they did in mice that were not nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They think this likely reflects a pre-implantation "pause." As mouse pregnancies typically last only 19 to 21 days, the pause reflects a significant delay in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then set about exploring how this pause might occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another group of newly pregnant mice, the team used a technique called optogenetics, which uses light to switch on specific neurons, to make the brains of the mouse moms release oxytocin. The researchers timed this stimulation to mimic the pulses of oxytocin seen during nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five days of this treatment, they removed the mice's uteruses to assess embryonic development. Five of the six mouse mothers had embryos that underwent diapause, as evidenced by a lack of development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in a comparison group, pregnant mice who did not have their oxytocin stimulated did not show any signs of diapause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another experiment, the team treated early mouse embryos with oxytocin in lab dishes, and that also induced cellular changes consistent with diapause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the evidence suggested that oxytocin caused embryonic cells to slow their translation of genes into proteins, the researchers reported March 5 in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt1763" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt1763" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Science Advances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This multistep process involves copying down instructions from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/37247-dna.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into a new molecule, called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that gets shipped to a cell's protein construction sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embryos without oxytocin receptors can still undergo diapause, Chao noted, so there are probably multiple signals that can trigger the pause. However, oxytocin seems to be important for the embryos to survive this arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers turned off oxytocin receptors in the mouse embryos, they found that only 11% survived diapause, compared with 42% of the embryos with working oxytocin receptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is an early exploration of the metabolism of early embryos, Chao said. Eventually, a better understanding of these mechanisms might reveal insight into why early miscarriages happen in people and could possibly lead to new fertility treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work will be needed to understand the biochemical steps that lead from oxytocin stimulation to diapause, Chao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings could also be helpful for understanding cell survival more generally, Chao added. For example, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604005020" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160604005020" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;half of the nerve cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the early embryo die as the developing nervous system is refined before birth. However, many of the nerve cells that develop in the womb ultimately last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Later on [in development], you don't want half your cells dying," Chao said, "so we're very interested in what keeps those cells going."&lt;/p&gt;

A new review highlights how unpredictable sensory experiences, beyond traditional stressors like abuse and neglect, can disrupt brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers explore key questions, including what stress means for a developing brain and how it shapes neural circuits long-term. Studies suggest that early stress alters gene expression and brain connectivity, influencing lifelong mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional scoring systems for childhood adversity may not fully capture individual risk, as emerging factors like inequality and pollution also contribute. Understanding these mechanisms could lead to new interventions to mitigate long-term effects of early-life stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unpredictability Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Inconsistent sensory experiences in early life can disrupt brain development, even without severe trauma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molecular Reprogramming:&lt;/strong&gt; Early-life stress alters gene expression and neural circuits, affecting mental health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Traditional Models:&lt;/strong&gt; Factors like social inequality and pollution may also contribute to childhood adversity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UC Irvine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early-life adversity affects more than half of the world’s children and is a significant risk factor for cognitive and mental health problems later in life. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an extensive and up-to-the-minute review of research in this domain, scholars from the University of California, Irvine illuminate the profound impacts of these adverse childhood experiences on brain development and introduce new paths for understanding and tackling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108181"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/child-adversity-behavior-brain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; Emerging factors, such as societal and anthropogenic characteristics like inequality and pollution, are gaining recognition as potential contributors. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study, published in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, examines the mechanisms behind the long-term consequences of childhood stress (adversity). Despite extensive research spanning over seven decades, the authors point out that significant questions remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, how do adults – from parents to researchers – fully comprehend what is perceived as stressful by an infant or child?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such conceptual queries, as well as the use of cutting-edge research tools, can provide a road map, guiding experts toward developing innovative methods and providing solutions to this pressing mental health issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that the unpredictability of a child’s early environment may be just as important as more traditionally recognized forms of adversity, such as abuse or neglect,” said lead author Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, Donald Bren Professor of Pediatrics and one of the world’s leading researchers in this field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our review has important implications for how we approach early intervention and prevention strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and co-author Matthew Birnie, a UC Irvine postdoctoral scholar, identify several key areas for further investigation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the developing brain perceive as stressful?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which aspects of stress most significantly influence brain maturation?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which developmental ages are most vulnerable to adversity?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the molecular mediators of stress effects on the brain?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How can transient stressful experiences lead to enduring dysfunction?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One notable discovery is a novel form of early-life stress: unpredictable sensory inputs from caregivers and the environment. This factor plays a substantial role in adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, even after controlling for well-known adverse childhood experiences, which are collectively referred to as ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review highlights the limitations of current ACE scoring systems in accurately predicting individual outcomes and underscores the complexity of early-life stress. Emerging factors, such as societal and anthropogenic characteristics like inequality and pollution, are gaining recognition as potential contributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal models have been instrumental in unraveling the mechanisms underlying brain development effects. Research has revealed that different types of stress can yield distinct outcomes, influenced by the nature and timing of stress, as well as species, strain and sex variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the molecular level, early-life stress can substantially alter neuronal gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. These changes may lead to long-term modifications in how the brain responds to subsequent experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the circuit level, early stress can disrupt the maturation of brain networks by interfering with crucial developmental processes, including neuronal oscillations and synaptic pruning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re gradually comprehending how early-life stress can ‘reprogram’ the brain at multiple levels, from individual molecules to entire neural circuits. This knowledge presents new avenues for targeted interventions,” Baram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review also identifies key molecular mediators of early-life stress effects, including glucocorticoids and neuropeptides like corticotropin-releasing hormones. Ongoing research is uncovering novel roles for these molecules in specific neural circuits affected by early stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In light of these findings, the researchers propose redefining early-life stress as “early-life adversity” to better encompass the diverse experiences that can impact brain development, even those not traditionally perceived as stressful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This review emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive understanding of early-life adversity,” Baram said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By focusing on how the developing brain processes and responds to these experiences, we can develop more effective strategies to prevent and mitigate their long-term effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest increased funding for and attention to this critical area of study, highlighting its potential to enhance mental health outcomes and reduce the societal burden of early-life adversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baram is also the Danette Shepard Chair in Neurological Studies and director of UC Irvine’s Conte Center, which is supported by a Silvio O.

                The total human cases from bird flu is still low but if the virus mutates in certain ways, scientists fear pandemic. They're studying how immunity from seasonal flu might protect us.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Bird flu has ripped through the animal kingdom for the past few years now, killing countless birds and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08054-z" target="_blank"&gt;crossing into&lt;/a&gt; an alarming number of mammals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yet people remain largely untouched.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the official tally&lt;/a&gt; of human cases in the U.S. is most certainly an undercount, there's still no evidence this strain of H5N1 has spread widely among us. But if the virus gains certain mutations, scientists fear it could trigger another pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This prospect has propelled research into whether our defenses built up from past flu seasons can offer any protection against H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So far, the findings offer some reassurance. Antibodies and other players in the immune system may buffer the worst consequences of bird flu, at least to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There's certainly preexisting immunity," says &lt;a href="http://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/krammerlab/" target="_blank"&gt;Florian Krammer&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine who is involved in some of the new studies. "That's very likely not going to protect us as a population from a new pandemic, but it might give us some protection against severe disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This protection is based on shared traits between bird flu and types of seasonal flu that have circulated among us. Certain segments of the population, namely older people, may be particularly well-primed because of flu infections during early childhood.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of course, there are caveats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While this is a bit of a silver lining, it doesn't mean we should all feel safe," says &lt;a href="https://med.emory.edu/departments/microbiology-immunology/research/labs/lakdawala/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Seema Lakdawala&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at Emory University's School of Medicine whose lab is probing this question.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For one thing, the studies can't be done on people. The conclusions are based on animal models and blood tests that measure the immune response. And how this holds up for an individual is expected to vary considerably, depending on their own immune history, underlying health conditions and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But for now, influenza researchers speculate this may be one reason most people who've caught bird flu over the past year have not fallen severely ill.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Earlier run-ins with flu can pay off&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;During the last influenza pandemic — the 2009 swine flu outbreak — people under 65 &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70121-4/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;accounted for most&lt;/a&gt; of the hospitalizations and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This was a surprising pattern for influenza, which generally strikes the elderly hardest. Scientists attribute it to the fact that people had dealt with a &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1186430" target="_blank"&gt;similar version&lt;/a&gt; of flu that had circulated until about 1957.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They were still getting infected, but they had an advantage," say &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/labs/sette-lab/" target="_blank"&gt;Alessandro Sette&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. "This is very clear evidence that preexisting immunity against influenza can have a beneficial effect."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So could we hope for a similar phenomenon — this time with H5N1 bird flu?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03599-6" target="_blank"&gt;published this month&lt;/a&gt; is encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By analyzing blood samples from close to 160 people, a team at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Chicago were able to show that people born roughly before 1965 had higher levels of antibodies — proteins that bind to parts of the virus — which cross-react to the current strain of bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's almost certain these people were never directly infected with that virus, meaning those antibodies can be traced to past seasonal flu infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They had a much clearer signal of an antibody response" than those born later, says &lt;a href="https://cobeylab.uchicago.edu/people/sarah-cobey/" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Cobey&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of ecology and evolution at the University of Chicago and senior author on the paper.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's driving that appears to be the viruses that people were infected with in childhood," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This is known as "immune imprinting" — when your immune system learns to respond to viruses that are the same or quite similar to the ones that first infected you.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Between 1968 and about 1977, the flu strain going around was more distantly related to H5N1, so people born in those years didn't have the same antibody response. And the picture becomes mixed in the following years because multiple versions of flu were spreading.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Younger individuals, particularly children, could end up being the most susceptible in the event of a pandemic, although the existing bird flu vaccines could boost antibodies in that group significantly, Cobey and her colleagues concluded in their study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's still going to be a lot of individual variation in what this disease could look like," she says. "If I were in my late 60s, I would still not be confident that this is necessarily going to be a mild disease for me.&lt;em&gt;" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Flu immunity guards against the 'worst virus' seen in animals&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/H5N1-seroprevalence-studies.html" target="_blank"&gt;found little to no evidence&lt;/a&gt; of past infections with H5N1 bird flu when they analyzed blood samples from the general population.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These tests focus on looking for antibody activity that would directly neutralize the bird flu virus. Other more fine-tuned measures, however, do turn up evidence that we are already familiar with and partly armed to fight this virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When battling an infection, the immune system makes antibodies that are targeted all over the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, Cobey's study measured antibodies that bind to a particular part of a protein that covers the surface of seasonal flu virus in humans and bird flu. Hemagglutinin, or the HA protein, latches onto the receptors of a cell so that it can gain entry and replicate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lakdawala says you can picture the HA as a "lollipop."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The heads can be very different, but those sticks, technically called "stalks," can sometimes be quite similar. That happens to be the case for bird flu and H1N1, which emerged as one of the predominant subtypes of seasonal flu after the 2009 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antibodies directed against the stalks of H1N1 viruses can cross-react with H5N1, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666379120301725" target="_blank"&gt;likely indicating&lt;/a&gt; some protection against severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Help may also come from antibodies aimed at the other dominant protein on the surface of influenza viruses, called neuraminidase.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In her lab, Lakdawala has recently run experiments on ferrets (a common stand-in for humans when studying respiratory disease) that suggest antibodies against this N1 protein — gained from previous seasonal flu infections — can also reduce severe illness when the animals catch bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These animals all survived. They didn't get that sick. Importantly the virus remained restricted to the respiratory tract," says Lakdawala.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She says this was a sharp contrast to previous studies where scientists took lab animals with no immunity to any kind of influenza and infected them with the current strain of bird flu. In that scenario, the infection went systemic, traveling into the bloodstream and brain.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People had described it as the worst virus they've ever put into an animal," she says. "So this offers a glimmer of hope."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1485_article" target="_blank"&gt;results appeared &lt;/a&gt;in the journal of &lt;em&gt;Emerging Infectious Diseases &lt;/em&gt;last month, alongside another ferret study &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1489_article" target="_blank"&gt;showing immunity&lt;/a&gt; from H1N1 could also limit the spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A third piece of the immunity puzzle — what could also explain Lakdawala's findings — are T cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Unlike antibodies, these immune cells hunt down the virus once it has broken into a cell and started to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.lji.org/news-events/news/post/t-cells-may-offer-some-protection-in-an-h5n1-spillover-scenario/" target="_blank"&gt;published last year&lt;/a&gt;, Sette and his team tested blood samples collected from volunteers to identify whether their T cells that target fragments of the flu virus could do the same for H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There was a nearly complete cross-recognition," says Sette.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The reason, he explains, is that proteins inside both of these influenza viruses are quite similar. Those fragments end up decorating the outside of the cell once it's infected, which is how T cells recognize it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is very hopeful, but we do not know how much cross-reactivity is necessary to impact disease severity," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Many unknowns about how deadly a pandemic could be&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers caution you can only extrapolate so much about pre-existing immunity from these studies.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's probably one of many factors that could be at play in the current outbreak including: a person's underlying health, whether they were exposed to a big "dose" of the virus, and the route of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And whatever mutations the virus gains in the future could change the risk calculus altogether.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are already concerns a variant of the current strain, known as the D1.1 genotype, might be more lethal, partly because it's linked to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-02262025.html" target="_blank"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; of the severe cases and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/06/nx-s1-5250251/bird-flu-death-louisiana" target="_blank"&gt;the only death&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. That variant had circulated widely in wild birds and gained attention recently after &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/05/nx-s1-5286265/bird-flu-cow-cattle-nevada" target="_blank"&gt;being detected&lt;/a&gt; in dairy cattle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lakdawala says her lab is still analyzing data on the D1.1 variant, but the initial results make her "hopeful" that their findings on pre-existing immunity apply here, as well.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Still, while there are reasons to believe at least some existing protection in the event of a pandemic or spillovers from livestock, scientists stress that bird flu is no joke. The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20250131.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;historical record&lt;/a&gt; of known H5N1 cases offers a harrowing case fatality rate of about 50% among humans.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's very likely an overestimate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Milder cases were probably missed over the years, as appears to be the case during this current outbreak, says Lakdawala. "Because if it were [that high now], we would be capturing so many more of the infections.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Krammer points out even a much lower fatality rate would be devastating:  "You don't need a 50% case fatality rate to have a really bad pandemic, right? If you have 1 or 2%, that could also be very bad already."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Since being nominated as America’s new health czar, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has said and done a lot of questionable stuff, the latest of which is to share his disturbing approach to the bird flu epidemic. RFK’s strategy for protecting the nation’s fowl population? Eh, just let the flu cull the herd and see if anything good comes out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/health/kennedy-bird-flu.html"&gt;reports that&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy has been suggesting that to defeat bird flu, you first have to let it get its groove on. The Times quotes a recent Fox News interview, in which Kennedy told the news channel’s listeners that America “should consider maybe the possibility of letting it run through the flock so that we can identify the birds, and preserve the birds, that are immune to it”—a notion Kennedy has offered multiple times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kennedy is only responsible for human health, not bird health (the Department of Agriculture is the point agency for that). Still, it’s not necessarily super comforting that Kennedy’s first impulse when he hears about a communicable illness is to just sit back and let it do its thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Gail Hansen, a former state veterinarian for Kansas, told the Times that Kennedy’s plan was “a really terrible idea, for any one of a number of reasons,” also calling it a “recipe for disaster.” Experts like Hansen seem to agree that giving the virus a free pass to spread would just allow it to mutate and grow more powerful. Indeed, other current and former federal officials and scientists that the newspaper spoke to all said that stepping back and letting bird flu ravage domestic chicken populations was really only a recipe for lost farm profits and more dead birds. Kennedy’s strategy (and the apparent worldview that informs it) also seems to hammer home the point that he is, on a fundamental level, unqualified to head the HHS. The Times writes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy “means longer quarantine, more downtime, more lost revenue and increased expenses,” said a U.S.D.A. scientist who was not authorized to speak to the media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr. Kennedy has suggested that a subset of poultry might be naturally immune to bird flu. But chickens and turkeys lack the genes needed to resist the virus, experts said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The way we raise birds now, there’s not a lot of genetic variability,” Dr. Hansen said. “They’re all the same bird, basically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This seems like yet another good example of why—when it comes to finding someone to lead the nation’s most powerful scientific policy and research organization—nominating a guy who self-admittedly &lt;a href="https://blog.ucs.org/dminovi/robert-f-kennedy-is-unfit-to-lead-u-s-public-health-agencies/"&gt;isn’t a scientist&lt;/a&gt; and doesn’t know anything about science might have been a stupid idea. But hey, while it seems increasingly unlikely that Kennedy can protect us from easily preventable illnesses like measles, and while he’s demonstrated a willingness to cut funding to critically important health research (including &lt;a href="https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/3/18/2311017/-RFK-Jr-s-anti-vax-stance-is-jeopardizing-cancer-treatments"&gt;cancer treatments)&lt;/a&gt;, and while he doesn’t seem particularly concerned that a nationwide chicken plague has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/business/egg-prices-wholesale.html#:~:text=An%20outbreak%20of%20bird%20flu,a%20dozen%20at%20their%20peak."&gt;driving up egg prices&lt;/a&gt;, at least he’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGetyhC4qVg"&gt;made America safe for tallow again&lt;/a&gt;, right? Yeah, tasty french fries are a good tradeoff for the breakdown of national health policy.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reveals that bowel movement frequency significantly influences physiology and long-term health, with the best outcomes linked with passing stools once or twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested associations between constipation and diarrhea with higher risks of infections and neurodegenerative conditions, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since these findings were observed in sick patients, it remained unclear whether irregular bathroom visits were the cause or result of their conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_132891" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the studied variables" class="size-medium wp-image-132891" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-642x578.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-461x415.jpg 461w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1-600x540.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/gr1.jpg 765w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-132891" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Participants provided samples of blood plasma and stool, in addition to filling out extensive diet, health, and lifestyle questionnaires.  (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Johnson-Martínez et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do hope that this work will kind of open clinicians' minds a bit to the potential risks of not managing bowel movement frequencies," senior author Sean Gibbons at the Institute for Systems Biology told AFP, explaining that doctors often view irregular movements as merely a "nuisance."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbons and his team collected clinical, lifestyle, and biological data – including blood chemistry, gut microbiome, genetics and more – from over 1,400 healthy adult volunteers with no signs of active disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants' self-reported bowel movement frequencies were categorized into four groups: constipation (one or two bowel movements per week), low-normal (three to six per week), high-normal (one to three per day), and diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When stools linger too long in the gut, microbes exhaust the available fiber – which they ferment into beneficial short-chain fatty acids – and instead ferment proteins, producing toxins like p-cresol sulfate and indoxyl sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we found is that even in healthy people who are constipated, there is a rise in these toxins in the bloodstream," said Gibbons, noting that these toxins are particularly burdensome to the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145266" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/fx1.jpg" alt="Graphic showing the study findings" class="wp-image-145266" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145266" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Toxins like p-cresol sulfate (PCS) and indoxyl sulfate (3-IS) in the bloodstream are particularly burdensome to the kidneys. (&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00360-4"&gt;Johnson-Martínez et al., &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;, 2024&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruits and vegetables key&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In cases of diarrhea, the team found clinical chemistries indicative of inflammation and liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbons explained that during diarrhea, the body excretes excessive bile acid, which the liver would otherwise recycle to dissolve and absorb dietary fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144992" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144992" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642.jpg" alt="Anatomical diagram of upper body with liver highlighted" class="size-full wp-image-144992" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642-295x415.jpg 295w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/LiverHumanAnatomy642-600x844.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144992" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The liver usually recycles bile acid to dissolve and absorb dietary fats.

&lt;p&gt;However, Gibbons emphasized that more research is needed to define this optimal range more precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographically, younger people, women, and those with a lower body mass index tended to have less frequent bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormonal and neurological differences between men and women may explain the gap, Gibbons said, along with the fact that men generally consume more food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144950" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144950" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642.png" alt="Food on a table with hands grabbing it" class="size-full wp-image-144950" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642-533x415.png 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PlantBasedDietFood642-600x467.png 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144950" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A more plant-dominant diet can have health benefits.

In fact, the US has been experiencing its most severe flu season in more than a decade. After a slow start, the second severe wave of influenza overwhelmed the healthcare system of the USA with many hospital admissions. Brain complications among kids have been one of the most concerning trends that has been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 19,000 people have died this year including 68 children, out of whom at least nine had flu-associated brain complications, according to a CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report published on February 27. A Maryland family is yet to recover from the death of their 10-year-old daughter due to complications of flu. She was sent back from the hospital twice after receiving medication and flu. However, it didn't help as soon, as the girl couldn't feel her legs and feet. By the time she was rushed to hospital, her brain showed no activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here's how the tragic incident unfolded&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka Aisha Greene, the healthy and lively 10-year-old developed low energy and a lack of appetite in late January, leaving her mother Kymesha Greene concerned. Greene noted that the girl's behavior changed. "She normally doesn’t get sick. This was like her first time getting sick,” the mother told DC News Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Minka was taken to the emergency room, she was diagnosed with the flu and a UTI. She was sent back home after receiving ibuprofen. However, soon the girl started experiencing headaches and was taken back to the hospital where she was given fluids and sent home for the second time again to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the morning, Minka's health deteriorated as she started vomiting in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I heard her screaming, ‘Mommy!’ And I’m like, ‘What’s wrong?’ That’s when she said she couldn’t feel her legs and her feet,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka who was not vaccinated for flu was rushed to hospital and on her way back Minka's eyes rolled to the back of her head and her tongue started moving uncontrollably. By the time they reached hospital, Minka stopped breathing. While CPR and other life-saving procedures were performed on her, the parents were told that their daughter had no brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was the last time I carried her, the last time I held her in my arms. I will cherish that for the rest of my life," said David, her father. The girl died on February 10 at the hospital. The heartbroken mother said they had to let their baby go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reason for Minka's death&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka suffered from severe brain inflammation caused by the flu. The parents are sharing their story to warn other parents about advocating for their babies and "when they say they’re hurting, tell the doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain complications in children due to Flu&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenza-associated encephalopathy or encephalitis (IAE) is a spectrum of neurological syndromes which can make kids critically ill. In January, the CDC received anecdotal reports of kids getting affected by it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encephalopathy can cause brain dysfunction while encephalitis may cause brain swelling, according to the Cleveland Clinic. IAE symptoms include seizures, decreased level of consciousness, hallucinations and personality changes lasting more than 24 hours, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of influenza viruses&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of influenza viruses namely Flu A, and Flu B with the former considered more dangerous. Flu B symptoms range from mild to severe. Neurological complications affect one-fifth of hospitalized children due to influenza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination and frequent handwashing are effective measures to contain the spread of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shocking! 14-yr-old girl’s leg amputated after wall collapses on her during heavy rains in Maharashtra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Hilariously Bossy Cockatoo Has Big Feelings About When Mom Is Allowed to Record Him - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVVh5OGFrbFlxTTJmeThTTEFtQ0xabUxsNlh4VTV2ZkY0aFR4ajhEd010TUpycTBRMDFSbXQ4MjJ4MExaa3FueGs0WUY4RjlXRTE2NlRGejRvSjJmUThwMlFGajZFTU93UFd2OVRPU1FwUFRKbzk0WGFjRFJwWkQzaUQ1dHdEU19YUElqVHByQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I think all of us pet parents have wished on more than one occasion that our cats and dogs could tell us what they want and what they are thinking, but some Cockatoo parents don't have this issue because their amazingly smart feather babies are telling them exactly what's on their mind. That's the case with a Cockatoo named Furby, who bosses his mama around and tells her when to stop and start filming him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He's just too adorable for words and such a smart fella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The sweetly hilarious video was uploaded to the TikTok account for @Furbythebirb, and everyone is so floored about how smart this sweetie is. One person commented, "It must be life changing to have an actual conversation with a bird."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/cockatoos-pole-dancing-routine-shows-true-queen-she-is" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Cockatoo's Pole Dancing Routine Shows Everyone What a True Club Queen She Is;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Cockatoo's Pole Dancing Routine Shows Everyone What a True Club Queen She Is&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I love how Furby says, "I'm shy. Don't record" and then he full on wilds out and tells her to record him because&lt;em&gt; he's flapping&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another person said, "I have seen plenty of birds that say words, but I’ve never seen one.

Wow!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We have written about sweet &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/cockatoo-watches-wkbn-weather-paul-wetzl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Furby a few times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Furby a few times&lt;/a&gt;, and one thing I absolutely adore about these videos is that Furby's mom, named Robin, is very sensitive to this Cockatoo's feelings and preferences. It's just such a sweet way to parent such an intelligent bird! She always asks him what he wants to do and if it's okay she does certain things with him, and it's just so kind and respectful. I'm pretty sure one of the reasons Furby is as amazing as he is has to do with the fact Robin is really careful with how she interacts with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/pet-news/cockatoo-helps-mom-finish-work-day-in-hilarious-destructive-way" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Related: Cockatoo 'Helps' Mom Finish Her Work Day Early in Hilariously Destructive Way;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Related: Cockatoo 'Helps' Mom Finish Her Work Day Early in Hilariously Destructive Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Furby is such a smart Cockatoo, and it's so wonderful that his mom respects that so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Intelligent Are Cockatoos?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salmon-Crested Cockatoo tilting head while sitting on perch.

The article states: “Unlike most other mammals, &lt;a href="https://paradepets.com/birds/best-bird-names" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:birds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt; are very similar to humans in the way they perceive the world around them — being visually and auditorily oriented, as well as intelligent and highly spatial. Thus, it makes sense that birds would perform quite well on these tests, reflecting similarities to human children in cognitive development.” The conclusion was, “So far, the performances turned in by a number of corvid and parrot species do rival those of human toddlers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;So, the next time you hear someone use the phrase&lt;em&gt; bird brain &lt;/em&gt;to describe someone of low intelligence, you can feel free to correct them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dog-face" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐶;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐶&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/newsletters/parade-pets" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIGN UP to get “pawsitivity” delivered right to your inbox with inspiring &amp;amp; entertaining stories about our furry &amp;amp; feathered friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/paw-prints" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:🐾🐾;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;🐾🐾&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 12:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPVVh5OGFrbFlxTTJmeThTTEFtQ0xabUxsNlh4VTV2ZkY0aFR4ajhEd010TUpycTBRMDFSbXQ4MjJ4MExaa3FueGs0WUY4RjlXRTE2NlRGejRvSjJmUThwMlFGajZFTU93UFd2OVRPU1FwUFRKbzk0WGFjRFJwWkQzaUQ1dHdEU19YUElqVHByQQ</guid></item><item><title>Florida man eats feral pig meat, contracts rare biothreat bacteria - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPVzFxTzdEdW5ETU9reUJoakxORlBCODdzbWNYV3hPYmVxSmpjam1neXZ6SGZncFl6Ym9KOU9JOEQyUm5qcFJnWW9RazBkZmdVcWRDN0ZDNkx0T0lheFhwanZCTXd2dVk3bjc5NVlIVzRINXRMa0ZWX3BGTFV0a2xZUWdVNmJ1VlZyNE5yd1hHWWhrV182TmtMYjVhZ2RkMlpYN1haQnFHdl8?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B. suis &lt;/em&gt;is an extremely infectious bacteria that's usually found in pigs. The most common symptom in pigs is reproductive losses, such as stillbirths, though they can also develop other symptoms, such as abscesses and arthritis. In humans, it causes an insidious, hard to detect infection called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;brucellosis&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to describe an infection from any &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; species: &lt;em&gt;B. suis, B. melitensis,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;B. abortus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;B. canis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the US, there are only about &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/BrucellosisFactSheet.pdf"&gt;80 to 140 brucellosis cases&lt;/a&gt; reported each year, and they're mostly caused by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/brucellosis"&gt;B. melitensis and B. abortus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. People tend to get infected by eating raw (unpasteurized) milk and cheeses. &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, however, is generally linked to hunting and butchering feral pigs and hogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, the &lt;em&gt;Brucella&lt;/em&gt; species were designated as select agents by the US government, a classification to flag pathogens and toxins that have the potential to be a severe threat to public health, such as if they're used in a bioterror attack. &lt;a href="https://www.selectagents.gov/sat/list.htm"&gt;The current list&lt;/a&gt; includes things like anthrax and Ebola virus. &lt;em&gt;Brucella &lt;/em&gt;species were originally listed because they can be easily aerosolized, and only a small number of the bacterial cells are needed to spark an infection. In humans, infections can be both localized and systemic and have &lt;a href="https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_suis.pdf"&gt;a broad range of clinical manifestations&lt;/a&gt;. Those include brain infections, neurological conditions, arthritis, anemia, respiratory involvement, pancreatitis, cardiovascular complications, like aneurysms, and inflammation of the spinal cord, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK441831/"&gt;among many other things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/12/17/2024-29567/agricultural-bioterrorism-protection-act-of-2002-biennial-review-and-republication-of-the-select"&gt;In January&lt;/a&gt;, federal officials removed &lt;em&gt;Brucella &lt;/em&gt;species from the select agents list—a designation that limits the types and amount of research that can be done on a pathogen. According to the US Department of Agriculture, the reason for the removal was &lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/aphis-updates-select-agents-toxins-registration-list-removes-agents"&gt;to ease those limits&lt;/a&gt;, thereby making it easier for researchers to conduct veterinary studies and develop vaccines for animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Perilous present&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding &lt;em&gt;B. suis&lt;/em&gt;, the doctors went to gather more information about how the man could have contracted this rare species. The man said he wasn't a hunter, but recalled receiving a gift of feral swine meat on several occasions in 2017 from a local hunter. Though he couldn’t recall the specific hunter who gave him the biohazardous bounty, he did remember handling the raw meat and blood with his bare hands—a clear transmission risk—before cooking and eating it.&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;When you need a quick meal, nothing hits the spot like a hot piece of cheesy &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/fast-food-pepperoni-pizzas-taste-test/" target="_blank"&gt;pizza&lt;/a&gt; loaded with your favorite toppings. But not everyone has time to run to their favorite pizza joint or wait for delivery. That's where &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/tag/frozen-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;frozen pizza&lt;/a&gt; comes in and makes a good option for those in a time crunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're in the mood for an all cheese pizza or one packed with meat and veggies, there's plenty of choices. An entire grocery aisle is dedicated to frozen pizza in many stores with affordable delicious options, making it easier on consumer's wallets for a fast cheap meal. In fact, according to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/5030661/frozen-pizza-global-strategic-business-report?utm_source=GNE&amp;amp;utm_medium=PressRelease&amp;amp;utm_code=tcq9st&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2031408+-+Frozen+Pizza+Industry+Analysis+Report+2024%3a+Global+Market+to+Reach+%2427.4+Billion+by+2030+from+%2420+Billion+in+2023+-+Online+Grocery+Trends+Influence+Sales+Dynamics&amp;amp;utm_exec=chdomspi" target="_blank"&gt;Research and Market&lt;/a&gt;, the global market for frozen pizza was at $21.2 billion last year and is projected to reach $27.4 billion by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;While you can't beat the convenience of a frozen pizza, it doesn't mean they're all healthy for you. Many are filled with so much salt and fat that if consumed often it could pose a serious health risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are key things to look for when shopping for a frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories&lt;/strong&gt;: Depending on age range and fitness goals, on average, the guidelines for calorie intake range between 1,600 to 2,000, per &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/how-many-calories-a-day-should-i-eat#:~:text=Calories%20per%20day%20for%20men%20and%20people,moderately%20active%202%2C600%2066%E2%80%9375%20Calories:%20sedentary%202%2C000" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturated fat&lt;/strong&gt;: Saturated fat is something you'll often find in frozen meals like pizza. According to the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats#:~:text=AHA%20Recommendation,of%20saturated%20fat%20per%20day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;, if you're following a 2,000-calorie-a-day diet, you should not have more than 13 grams of saturated fat. Too much can lead to serious health issues like high cholesterol and heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium&lt;/strong&gt;: Some frozen pizza contain a lot of salt for flavor. While it might be tasty, you're risking your heart. The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; says too many Americans consume more salt than recommended. The organization suggests having no more than 2,300 milligrams a day, but many people have 3,500mg daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help guide you through the plethora of frozen pizzas, Eat This, Not That! spoke with dietitians who reveal the worst ones on the shelves ranked in order from unhealthiest to absolutely terrible for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p class="nutrinfo-black"&gt;&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Nutrition&lt;/span&gt;: ⅕ of the pizza&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Calories&lt;/span&gt;: 320&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Fat&lt;/span&gt;: 16 g (Saturated fat: 8 g)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Sodium&lt;/span&gt;: 730 mg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Carbs&lt;/span&gt;: 28g (Fiber: 2g , Sugar: 3g)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;span class="upper"&gt;Protein&lt;/span&gt;: 15g&lt;/p&gt;
        
&lt;p&gt;Pizza is already tasty enough, but when you add a cheese stuffed crust, it takes the pie to a whole other level, but one that's really bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you are looking for a better option health-wise for a frozen pizza – it would seem obvious to steer clear from a product with its crust stuffed with cheese and topped with cured meats," says Michelle Rauch MSc RDN, Registered Dietitian/Nutritionist for &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-rauch-msc-rdn-55a6773/" target="_blank"&gt;The Actors Fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Digiorno's brags that each pizza is stuffed with 2 ½ feet of cheese in its crust in addition to what is on top of the product, but for only 1/5 of this pizza you'll be eating 320 calories, and 16g of fat (of which half is saturated)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the alarming amount of calories and fat for a small slice, salt is another concern to be aware of with this pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauch says, "One serving, which is just 1/5 of this pie contains 730 mg of sodium is half (48.6%) of the recommended daily sodium amount as recommended by the American Heart Association for those with conditions such has high blood pressure and kidney disease (1500mg) and approximately 1/3 (31.7%) for of the daily value for the general population (2300mg).  Some of the excessive sodium in this product is coming from the pepperoni and the cheeses."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a healthier choice, Rauch recommends a thinner crust without  extra meat and cheese toppings. Or make one yourself with fresh pizza dough and choose better ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://screaminsicilian.com/product/original-ultimate-deluxe/" target="_blank"&gt;Screamin' Sicilian Ultimate Deluxe&lt;/a&gt; has generous toppings with a variety of crunchy veggies, but according to Rauch, this frozen pizza doesn't deserve space in your freezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She says, "This pizza from Screamin' Sicilian is advertised as 'everything but the kitchen sink' with a buttery crust, mounds of whole-milk mozzarella cheese and 'piled high with Italian sausage, premium pepperoni", and some veggies such as peppers, onions, and mushrooms."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean it should be eaten very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauch explains, "A single serving of the Ultimate Deluxe is listed as 1/5 of the pie which contains 350 calories and 770 mg of sodium. This is 33% of the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association's recommendatio&lt;/a&gt;n for sodium per day for the general population and just over half (51%) for those who are supposed to limit salt intake due conditions such as hypertension and kidney disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, "Italian meats such as sausage and pepperoni along with cheese are known to have a high salt content and should be limited for those with high blood pressure and kidney disease.  This high sodium product, if eaten, doesn't leave room to stay in those recommended guidelines for the remainder of the day."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauch also emphasizes, "Once slice (based on the recommended serving size) contains 20g of fat – 8g of which is saturated.  The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association recommends&lt;/a&gt; limited Saturated Fats to under 6% of your total calories per day.  To put that into perspective, if you are eating 2000 calories daily – you should not eat more than 13g of those types of fats per day.    In this case, you would have already gone over that."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thin crust people is typically a bit healthier and has less calories and fat, but &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/violeta-morris" target="_blank"&gt;Violeta Morris&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN from Columbus, OH, The Concierge Dietitian, &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://@conciergedietitianvioleta" target="_blank"&gt;@conciergedietitianvioleta&lt;/a&gt; says not to let the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.shopbernatellospizza.com/bellatoria-ultra-thin-crust-ultimate-supreme-%20pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;Bellatoria Ultimate Supreme Pizza&lt;/a&gt;  fool you into thinking it's healthier than other frozen pizzas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Its nutritional profile is quite like other frozen options, with 350 calories per serving, 20 grams of fat, 740 mg of sodium, 24 grams of carbohydrates, and 16 grams of protein," she says. "This pizza contains enriched flour and three types of sugar—sugar, dextrose, and maltodextrin—which add to its refined carbohydrate content, potentially raising its glycemic load and providing empty calories."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.goodnes.com/digiorno/products/croissant-crust-four-cheese-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;Digiorno Four Cheese Croissant Crust Pizza&lt;/a&gt; is a mouthwatering blend of four cheeses with a croissant crust, but Rauch says that it's not an "ideal choice" for healthy frozen pizza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Looking at this &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.goodnes.com/digiorno/crusts/croissant/" target="_blank"&gt;whole line from Diogiorno's&lt;/a&gt; – this is probably the 'better' choice over their 'croissant crusted' varieties of pepperoni or three meats." She explains, "If you are able to stop at just 1/5 of the pie (their calculated serving), that's almost 400 kcals (370 kcals), and 18g of fat – half of which (50%) is saturated.  It's no surprise with a product loaded with cheese, and a crust made of a French pastry.   Eating a diet high in fats can lead to an increase in cholesterol which in turn increases the risk of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;developing heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, stroke, obesity, and other metabolic disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides being high in fat, sodium is also a problem with this pizza, so avoid or eat very seldomly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's no question the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.redbaron.com/products/fully-loaded-hand-tossed/fully-loaded-hand-tossed-meat-lovers.htm" target="_blank"&gt;RED BARON Fully Loaded Hand Tossed Meat Lovers Pizza&lt;/a&gt; is a dream for carnivores, but it's a nightmare for your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Most labels show nutrition facts for 1/4 of the pizza, but for RED BARON Fully Loaded Hand Tossed Meat Lovers Pizza, the nutrition facts are for 1/6th of the pie meaning the fat, calories, and sodium are much higher when eaten in a typical volume," &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="http://entirelynourished.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Michelle Routhenstein&lt;/a&gt;, MS RD CDCES CDN, Preventive Cardiology Dietitian and Heart Health Expert at EntirelyNourished.com points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explains, "If you have 1/2 of this pizza, you would hit the upper limit of saturated fat for a day and surpass an upper sodium threshold for the day. We want to limit saturated fat since high levels can increase LDL cholesterol and lead to insulin resistance."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routhenstein explains the "Great Value Stuffed Crust Pepperoni Pizza is loaded with saturated fat, sodium, and made with simple carbohydrates, not offering much satisfaction at only 1/5th of a pizza!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She adds, "Consuming more than 1/5th of the pie leads to very high saturated fat, sodium, and refined carbohydrate levels which can negatively impact cardiometabolic health."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While I, as a dietitian and a mother, understand the appeal of offering pizza occasionally to kids, it's important to recognize that frozen pizzas, like this one, are packed with empty calories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and lack essential nutrients," Morris says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pizza contains a high amount of sodium, saturated fat and calories, but Morris explains it's also ultra processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Research, including a 2024 review published in the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10899807/" target="_blank"&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/a&gt;, examined 45 studies involving nearly 10 million participants and found links between ultra processed foods and 32 health concerns, including cardiometabolic diseases, mental health issues, and higher mortality rates. As parents, it's important to be aware of these findings to make more informed decisions about what we feed our children."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the pizza is is marketed on their website as the #1 selling frozen pizza in the Chicagoland area and is now available nationwide that Morris advises to be very careful how much you consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a dietitian, it's important to be mindful of how many slices you're eating, as the nutritional content can add up quickly," she says. "After eating frozen pizza, ask yourself how long you feel full. While it may be a quick and convenient meal, it can leave you feeling unsatisfied and hungry again just a few hours later."&lt;/p&gt;

The disease no longer kills &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/world-tb-day/history/index.html#:~:text=In%201882%2C%20TB%20disease%20killed,more%20about%20this%20deadly%20disease."&gt;one in seven people&lt;/a&gt; in the US, as it did in the 19th century. But look elsewhere and its burden is still terrible: TB killed &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;more than 1.2 million people&lt;/a&gt; in 2023, likely making it once again the deadliest infection on Earth, after it was briefly supplanted by Covid-19 during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And as &lt;a href="/future-perfect/384524/john-green-author-youtuber-tuberculosis-advocacy-future-perfect-50"&gt;John Green&lt;/a&gt;, YA author, YouTuber, and author of the new book &lt;a href="https://www.johngreenbooks.com/everything-is-tuberculosis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Is Tuberculosis: The History and Persistence of Our Deadliest Infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, told me in an interview: “That number is about to go up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="/future-perfect/404040/foreign-aid-cuts-trump-charts-usaid-pepfar-who-hiv"&gt;evisceration of US international aid&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration is ending funding for its global TB programs. The US is the world’s largest single funder of tuberculosis treatment, and the spending cuts &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/tuberculosis/usaid-funding-freeze-disrupts-global-tuberculosis-control-efforts#:~:text=TB%20medications%20that%20have%20already,is%20working%E2%80%94have%20been%20interrupted."&gt;quickly interrupted medical care&lt;/a&gt; for TB victims. And any delay in treatment &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/epidemiology/articles/10.3389/fepid.2023.1234865/full#:~:text=Introduction%3A%20Tuberculosis%20treatment%20interruption%20increases,occurrence%20of%20drug%20resistant%20Tuberculosis."&gt;can lead&lt;/a&gt; to worse outcomes for patients and makes it more likely the bacteria will evolve to resist antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“All of this is a direct result of the decisions made by the US government,” Green told me. “Allowing tuberculosis to spread unchecked throughout the world is bad news for all humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There may be as many as 10 million additional TB cases by 2030 because of the cuts, depending on how deep they ultimately are, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.04.25323340v1.full.pdf"&gt;one initial estimate&lt;/a&gt;.

One TB program director &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/10/us-aid-cuts-tuberculosis-tb-untreatable-bug-drug-resistance-stop-tb-partnership-who?utm_source=dlvr.it"&gt;told The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; last week their funding had still not resumed despite receiving a reassurance from the administration that it would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The funding freeze is not only a threat to people in the developing world who live with tuberculosis as an ever-present threat, Green told me — it also poses a risk to the US itself. Right now, Kansas has &lt;a href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2242/Tuberculosis-Outbreaks"&gt;68 active TB cases&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest US outbreaks in recent history. One estimate from the Center for Global Development &lt;a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/tuberculosis-doesnt-respect-borders-us-aid-cuts-could-fuel-global-health-crisis"&gt;finds that&lt;/a&gt; US TB cases will rise in parallel with cases in the rest of the world. That won’t just increase health care costs — it will increase the risk that TB will become more drug-resistant and therefore deadlier to people around the world, including in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I spoke with Green about the history of one of humanity’s oldest infectious diseases, the threat posed by the Trump administration’s cuts, and what concerned people can do in response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Our conversation is below, edited for clarity and length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the state of tuberculosis right now? Why do people in the US and other wealthy countries often think of it as a disease of the past, a problem that has been solved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I used to think of it as a disease of the past as well. I thought of TB primarily as the &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/column-poet-john-keats-met-early-end#:~:text=Today%20marks%20the%20day%20in,Tom%2C%20who%20died%20in%201819."&gt;disease that killed John Keats&lt;/a&gt;, and then we figured out a solution to it, so now it’s not a threat anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But in fact, tuberculosis is still the world’s deadliest infectious disease. It kills over 1.2 million people per year. That number is about to go up. It sickens about 10 million people per year. Around a quarter of all living humans have experienced a TB infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, the vast majority of those people will never become sick. They’ll have what we call latent TB, where these clumps of white blood cells form what are called tubercles to surround the bacteria and keep it in check. But in about 10 percent of people who experience a TB infection, they will become sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We understand some of the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tb/risk-factors/index.html"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for developing active TB disease. They include malnutrition, other health problems like diabetes, or HIV infection. But we don’t fully understand why some people develop active TB and others don’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You call the disease “weird” in your book. What is weird about TB? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The weirdest thing about TB is the cell wall that the bacteria builds. It builds this really thick, fatty cell wall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That takes a long time to build, so TB has an extremely slow growth rate compared to other bacteria; in some cases, hundreds of times slower. That means that it sickens us slower because it takes a long time to overwhelm the body’s defenses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This is one of the reasons why tuberculosis used to be a narratively convenient disease, a disease that was the subject of so many books. It was a narratively compelling disease because it tends to take a life slowly over the course of months or years, rather than all at once like a disease like cholera or the black plague.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Classically, we understood death as something that occurred very early on in life because about half of people died before the age of 5, or something that occurred late in adulthood, in your 50s or after. Tuberculosis killed so many people in their 20s and 30s that it was called the robber of youth. But it also killed people early in childhood and late in adulthood. It killed indiscriminately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;To some extent, it still does. I mean, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/20-11-2024-inclusion-for-every-child--reaching-every-child-affected-by-tuberculosis"&gt;218,000 kids&lt;/a&gt; are going to die of tuberculosis this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s so frustrating to me is that all of those deaths are unnecessary because we’ve had a cure since the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This disease has been with us forever. It was even glamorized to an extent in earlier generations. But then there was a transition when it became more stigmatized — it became associated with being dirty and poor. How did that happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Until 1882, at least in Northern Europe and the United States, it was generally believed that tuberculosis was an inherited genetic condition. But in 1882, the German doctor &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000222.htm#:~:text=On%20March%2024%2C%201882%2C%20Robert,tuberculosis%20and%20its%20causative%20agent."&gt;Robert Koch&lt;/a&gt; proved that tuberculosis was in fact caused by bacteria. The moment it became an infectious disease is really the moment that our imagining of the disease changed radically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Instead of being a disease of wealth and civilization, it became a disease of poverty. The implications of this were huge because it meant that we could control tuberculosis by trying to control the bacteria that caused TB. But it also meant that we wanted much more control over the lives of people living with tuberculosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We started to understand them very differently. We started to see people with tuberculosis as a threat to the social order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the same time, by the middle of the 20th century, we developed vaccines and cures. How did our perception of TB continue to change — and how did race increasingly factor into it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;TB had &lt;a href="https://www.gresham.ac.uk/watch-now/tb-history"&gt;long been understood&lt;/a&gt; by Europeans as a racialized disease. It was widely believed in Europe and in the US among white doctors that only white people could get consumption because it was a disease of civilization. To acknowledge that consumption was common among people of color and colonized people would have been to undermine the entire project of colonialism itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After we understood the disease as infectious, it became racialized in a different way, where it came to be argued that people of color were uncommonly susceptible to tuberculosis. Instead of believing that it was impossible for them to get tuberculosis, people started to argue that their susceptibility to tuberculosis was owing to some factor inherent to race. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now, we knew this was hogwash from the beginning. There were lots of doctors, including African American doctors and researchers, pushing back against this notion. They argued, correctly, that the actual cause of tuberculosis was crowded living and working conditions, poor pay, malnutrition — all the stuff that today we know does cause tuberculosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the racialization of the disease was so profound that it’s still shaping who lives and dies of tuberculosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, how does tuberculosis look in the United States versus a place like Sierra Leone, which you cover extensively in your book?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Starting in the 1940s, we began to develop &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ja2014108"&gt;treatments for tuberculosis&lt;/a&gt; that were very powerful. We created combinations of multiple antibiotics that, given over the course of several months or even years, could cure tuberculosis. This disease that had always been one of the leading human killers suddenly became curable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Unfortunately, we did a really poor job of distributing this cure to the places where it was most needed. As a result, we’ve seen the development of extensive drug resistance for tuberculosis, and we’ve seen a huge amount of ongoing suffering from the disease. The Ugandan HIV researcher Dr. Peter Mugyenyi &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(21)00222-9/fulltext"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; of HIV drugs in the year 2000: “Where are the drugs? The drugs are where the disease is not. And where is the disease? The disease is where the drugs are not.” And that’s very much the case with tuberculosis as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If you or I got tuberculosis tomorrow, even if we had a complex drug-resistant case, we would get access to the best personalized, tailored treatments of antibiotic cocktails we would need in order to cure our TB. But for someone like my friend Henry living in Sierra Leone, when he got really sick in 2019 and 2020, those drugs weren’t available to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;So even though his TB was very curable, his life was at risk — not ultimately because of a lack of technology, but because of failure to get the technology to the places where it’s most needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the book, you called TB both a form and an expression of injustice. It seems to me that TB is one very striking example of a pattern of injustice that applies across a lot of diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Yeah. I think it’s really important to acknowledge that tuberculosis is not the only disease of injustice. &lt;a href="/future-perfect/369095/hepatitis-vaccine-deaths-symptoms-infections"&gt;Hepatitis&lt;/a&gt; is a disease of injustice. &lt;a href="/future-perfect/395355/malaria-vaccines-rollout-children-rtss-r21"&gt;Malaria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/explain-it-to-me/396016/hiv-aids-cure-pepfar-who-progress"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/the-highlight/24093360/early-cancer-young-adults-colon-stomach-research"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; are diseases of injustice. When my brother got cancer, one of the first things he said to me was that there was a 94 percent cure rate if you have access to treatment, and about a 5 percent cure rate if you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s very hard to grapple with the fact that the real cause of a huge percentage of human death is injustice — the failures of human-built systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There are many deaths that we simply don’t have the technology or the tools to prevent. But there are many, many, many, many deaths that we do have the technologies and tools to prevent. It’s important to understand that as a justice problem, as an equity problem, as a failure to appropriately apportion the resources that we as a human species have developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It breaks my heart. It’s devastating. I’m often asked whether I think people are good. Like, at the end of this book, do I think people are good? And I can’t answer that question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What I can say is I think people are capable of extraordinary generosity and compassion and sacrifice. When people are proximal to suffering, they show an extraordinary capacity for giving. And when people are not proximal to suffering, when people don’t let themselves become close to the suffering of others, they can act monstrously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There has been imperfect progress on global health, but progress nonetheless. But now the US government is pulling back from the global health commitments that have helped make that progress possible. What does this mean for TB specifically?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The United States has long been the most generous donor when it comes to fighting TB, and now essentially all tuberculosis-related funding has been &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/05-03-2025-funding-cuts-to-tuberculosis-programmes-endanger-millions-of-lives#:~:text=This%20funding%20was%20approximately%20one,been%20the%20largest%20bilateral%20donor."&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt;. That’s catastrophic on a number of levels. To my Republican friends and congressional representatives, I try to compare it to the 2008 financial crisis when the capital markets just froze, and it was very hard to get them to start working again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In many communities, that’s what’s happening as a result of this sudden, chaotic, very unpredictable, haphazardly rolled-out funding freeze. Hundreds of thousands of people have seen their treatment &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/tuberculosis/usaid-funding-freeze-disrupts-global-tuberculosis-control-efforts"&gt;interrupted&lt;/a&gt;, and we know that’s a catastrophe, not only for those individuals, many of whom will die, perhaps most of whom tragically will die, but also because it means that they will develop &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/10/us-aid-cuts-tuberculosis-tb-untreatable-bug-drug-resistance-stop-tb-partnership-who?utm_source=dlvr.it"&gt;drug resistance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even a couple of weeks without getting access to your medication means a skyrocketing chance of drug resistance. Even if they’re able to get back on treatment, the relatively inexpensive treatment that worked before may no longer work. That means more cases of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis circulating in communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s also a threat to the United States. We have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7312a4.htm#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%2050%20U.S.,0.8%20cases%20per%20100%2C000%20persons."&gt;10,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; of active tuberculosis in the US every year. We have a tuberculosis outbreak right now in &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/tuberculosis-in-kansas-the-larger-picture"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;. Tuberculosis anywhere is a threat to people everywhere and allowing tuberculosis to spread unchecked throughout the world is bad news for all humans. It’s bad news for human health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We’ve made so much progress in human health during my lifetime. The year I graduated from high school, 12 million children died under the age of 5. Last year, &lt;a href="/future-perfect/24100883/child-mortality-rate-worldwide-united-nations"&gt;fewer than 5 million did&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It’s easy to feel like that progress is inevitable or natural or somehow it was always going to happen. But it wasn’t always going to happen. It happened because millions of people worked together to make it happen, because we decided collectively to value children’s lives more and to work hard to protect them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Now what we’re seeing is the first regression of my lifetime when it comes to overall human health. We’re seeing it in the United States where life expectancy &lt;a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/healthy-aging/whats-behind-the-decline-in-american-life-expectancy/"&gt;has been going down&lt;/a&gt;. We’re about to see it globally where tuberculosis cases, by one estimate, will increase by 30 percent over the next couple of years, leading to 13 million people getting sick every year instead of 10 million and leading to hundreds of thousands more people dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;All of this is a direct result of the decisions made by the US government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like it’s hard for people to understand the feedback loop that’s potentially in play here that can put our health at risk because diseases are spreading elsewhere. I think it’s also hard for us to take the long view.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious where you think that failure comes from? And have you seen anything that’s sort of effective in overcoming that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I think we have to bridge the empathy gap. There’s always an empathy gap between every person, right? I don’t know what it’s like to be you. I don’t know about your joys and sorrows. And even when I do, I can only kind of situate them in my own experience. I can only relate to it through my own eyes because those are the only eyes I get to see through for the whole time that I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And so there’s always an empathy gap, but that empathy gap grows or shrinks based on how close you allow yourself to be to the suffering and joy of others. And so you know when my uncle gets sick, I’m going to respond to that very differently than if I hear through the grapevine that someone else’s uncle is sick. And for me, the empathy gap is also a social justice gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The further the rich world feels from someone’s life, the less likely the rich world is to intervene. So for me, it’s about shrinking that empathy gap everywhere we can so that we understand that the lives of other people, even other people whose lives may feel distant from ours are just as real and just as important as ours, that their joy and grief and longing and loss is as real and profound as ours is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;I try to do that in the book by telling Henry’s story because you can talk all day about what a great investment tuberculosis response is, and it is a great long-term financial investment. You can talk all day about how many people are dying of TB every year. All that just boils down to statistics. And the statistics don’t decrease the empathy gap, at least for me. And so I wanted to tell a human story at a human scale because I feel like that’s what really changes our perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What options are available to people like Vox readers, who want to contribute in some small way to making these problems better? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It sounds meaningless and everybody says it, but it’s true. When you reach out to your congressional representatives insofar as you’re lucky enough to have some say in your governance, it really matters. What funding we’ve been able to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-restores-some-aid-humanitarian-groups-ask-where-is-money-2025-03-07/"&gt;claw back for USAID&lt;/a&gt; is a result of people reaching out to their senators and representatives and those senators and representatives in turn reaching out to Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio and saying, “This is ridiculous. This can’t happen.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s really, really important that people in power hear that it is unacceptable for the United States to walk away from its long-term commitments to global health and human health, and that it’s unacceptable for the United States to break its promises. They need to hear it’s also bad for America. It’s bad for farmers who provide food aid. It’s bad for overall human health in the United States. We’re seeing our own numbers of tuberculosis cases go up every year, and that will accelerate now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQQVYybEZKWENKdFQ0T0VUMTZySWtQMUU0aE5QMnp6WEktb2g3c00yU2RMc1dSclV5Z2lqXzJwYmh6SV9MTE9PbjhKMFJ0SnRMazJuVUNtMXRzZ1ZuR2pnX3lGWWYyRnJKU3hFeUF3RVZTTWR6ZzFhZWpjaTlfSHctSlN0RklHSmM</guid></item><item><title>S.F. may stop giving free foil and pipes to drug users.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlh9iq000v26oxfsb49khv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the early 2000s, when Dr. Alexandra Cvijanovich was completing her medical training in Utah, her team cared for a 13-year-old boy with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001185.htm#:~:text=Subacute%20sclerosing%20panencephalitis%20(SSPE)%20is,Walker%20Boulevard%2C%20Augusta%20GA%2030912." target="_blank"&gt;subacute sclerosing panencephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, a degenerative neurological disease that can be fatal. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=Subacute%20sclerosing%20panencephalitis%20(SSPE)%20is,10%20years%20after%20measles%20infection." target="_blank"&gt;rare complication&lt;/a&gt; of the measles virus that appears years after the initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00023b5vzytp5e1g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The boy had been infected with measles when he was 7 months old, after contact with an unvaccinated child. Years later, he died of the complications, and Cvijanovich has never forgotten about him.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00033b5vl58o0njg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He … got the virus before he could be immunized. And that’s just a tragic, horrible, preventable death,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00043b5vw9e58sdo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials recommend that children get their first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine between &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;12 and 15 months&lt;/a&gt; of age. Two doses of the vaccine are 97% effective against the measles virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ezmdvv00013b6mtfn69zry@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To achieve herd immunity, where enough people are vaccinated that infection doesn’t widely spread in the community, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;95%&lt;/a&gt; of the population needs to be vaccinated, according to the US Department of Health and Human Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00053b5vwfqa9sfd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now a pediatrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Cvijanovich treats people from all over the state – including the southeastern region, which is currently part of one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/18/health/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-oklahoma"&gt;more than 300&lt;/a&gt; people across three states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00063b5v8wgn9zx6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She often tells the story of her 13-year-old patient to families that are hesitant to vaccinate their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00073b5vjv7sqlbg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I tried to use stories of patients that I’ve taken care of,” she said, “and then I also tried to plead with people that they actually think about the greater good of the community around them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk00083b5viqo5pcl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many pediatricians say they are seeing an increase in parents who are hesitant to vaccinate their children with the MMR vaccine and others. Here are some of their tips for communicating with vaccine-hesitant parents.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000a3b5v0qltwc67@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the key to communicating with families about vaccination is to address their specific concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000b3b5v0ccunfj8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tailoring your approach and your communication to that family-specific concern has been the most effective for me and my practice,” said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. “That is really what helps families feel confident about their choice.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000c3b5vxrmzr9uh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For some families, this includes addressing worries about side effects they may hear through anecdotes in their communities. Pediatricians say these often circulate in community or family WhatsApp groups or through parent Facebook groups.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000d3b5vrzz6ktad@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So I am taking time to say, ‘pull it up, let’s look it up together. Who did it come from? Do you know this person? Do you know their full medical history?’ ” Bracho-Sanchez said. “And I do spend time outlining the difference between something happening to someone around the time that they had a vaccine and someone having something happen as a result of the vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000e3b5v0m3eemnp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts warn against getting medical advice or information from community social media and urge patients to have conversations with their providers instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000f3b5vnkdhgvkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other families may have concerns about specific ingredients in vaccines, and doctors recommend understanding which ones are causing worries, like metals or preservatives. Explaining how those same ingredients might also be found in foods or other daily life exposures can quell those fears, according to Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000h3b5vkai9xx43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As Cvijanovich has found with her own experiences, helping patients understand the illnesses they are preventing with vaccination can be helpful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000i3b5vp0khe9zf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vaccines have been victims of their own success,” Johns said. “We don’t see many of these vaccine-preventable illnesses anymore [and] people think they’re no big deal. And the fact is that they really are a very big deal.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000j3b5vrgcnl70h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With measles, the consequences can be severe. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html#:~:text=Encephalitis.,deaf%20or%20with%20intellectual%20disability." target="_blank"&gt;One in five&lt;/a&gt; unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, 1 in 20 children with measles will develop pneumonia, and 1 in 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis, or swelling of the brain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000k3b5vgo32ny0o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/13/health/measles-vaccine-shot-booster-adults-wellness"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;One to three in 1,000 children who have measles will die from complications, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. A school-age child who was not vaccinated is among the two deaths that have already been associated with the ongoing measles outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000l3b5vj0j8ius2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Being a pediatrician, watching my patients grow up, that’s the best part of my job,” Cvijanovich said. “I mean, that’s why I go into work every day. I love seeing babies who then enter middle school and graduate from high school and go off to college. That’s fantastic. And the best tool I have to accomplish this is vaccines.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000n3b5v5a2pkz8k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some pediatricians say that approaching these conversations in “partnership” has gone a long way.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000o3b5v2buhn8pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pediatricians want what’s best for your child. That’s why I’m in this business, and I know that is true for you as a parent about your own child,” Johns said. “So given that, let’s talk through why you’re concerned that this might not be the best thing for your child and why I’m convinced that it is. And let’s sort through that together.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000p3b5vd0af86a1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even when parents might be fearful about getting certain vaccines for their children, trust in doctor-patient relationships can be helpful, according to Bracho-Sanchez.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000q3b5v8em1qljx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Some parents will still say, ‘OK, I trust you, Doctor. Let’s go ahead and do this.’ But it doesn’t mean that they’re completely fearless, right? They trust me and our relationship and my explanation and the conversations that we have, [which is] enough to go ahead and vaccinate,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000r3b5vpgojwb60@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even if parents choose not to vaccinate their children at the end of an appointment, doctors can leave the door open for future conversation and continuing dialogue, Johns said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8eyglqk00023b5v16tcl9dy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Officials say the current measles outbreak, which started in West Texas, is rooted in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/west-texas-measles-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Mennonite community&lt;/a&gt; whose members may not seek traditional health care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ey6gls00003b5v1a71pseo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In talking with members of the community, we’re not necessarily seeing that this is hesitancy … around religion. We’re seeing it much more as they have been impacted, just like the rest of Americans with a lot of the social media,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f045rp00003b5v5r0i6631@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She said she has found one-on-one conversations or community health workers meeting with small groups to be most useful in addressing this hesitancy in West Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000t3b5vzfecq36s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Anti-vaccine websites and misinformation have become “more sophisticated,” Cvijanovich said. This raises the amount of concerns that many parents have when considering whether to vaccinate their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000u3b5v2hrkdhtx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s important not to be dismissive and not to be superior. Not say, ‘Well, I have my MD degree, and therefore, I learned how to analyze data, and you don’t know this,’” she said. Doctors need to be “understanding that there is a vast amount of information available to parents these days, and it is a constant challenge to figure out what’s accurate and what’s inaccurate, what’s misleading.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f04p6n00023b5v7cgyn426@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, some false claims have spread so broadly that Cvijanovich says some of her patients are not so much “vaccine-hesitant” as “anti-vaccine.” She described a family that expressed that they think the measles cases in New Mexico are a “conspiracy to try to get their kids vaccinated.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8f0b8mu00053b5vx407eyh2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So [my] arguments, they do tend to fall on deaf ears, unfortunately, but I continue to have the discussions,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000w3b5vsadbacz2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With any infectious disease, the spread affects not only individuals but communities. With a virus as contagious as measles, which can stay airborne for two hours even after an infected person leaves a room, its effect on entire communities is heightened.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000x3b5vuocirfar@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some doctors have found that highlighting protection for the whole over the self can be an effective strategy in encouraging vaccination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8dlhdlk000y3b5vcmixb0nt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Sometimes, people are willing to get infected and deal with the side effects that you do get infected, but sometimes you can reach them if they realize, ‘hey, I’m not just talking about myself. I can make potentially other people sick, too,’ ” said Dr. Vivek Cherian, a Chicago-based internal medicine doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

These autopsies revealed a reduced presence of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology among regular egg consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that egg consumption may have a protective effect on the brain, potentially slowing the progression of Alzheimer's-related changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis indicated that 39 percent of the protective effect of egg consumption was mediated through dietary choline, a nutrient abundant in eggs that is essential for brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline assists in the production of neurotransmitters, particularly acetylcholine, which is vital for memory and cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choline, found in abundance in eggs, supports the structural integrity of brain cell membranes and aligns with previous research linking choline intake to enhanced cognitive function. This study strengthens evidence proposing a connection between choline consumption and mental acuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The potential benefits of choline-rich diets for brain health are increasingly recognized; such diets may include foods like eggs. With Alzheimer's disease being a major contributor to dementia worldwide, the link between diet and cognitive aging grows more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauren Ball, Professor of Community Health and Wellbeing, and Karly Bartrim, Lecturer in Nutrition and Dietetics at The University of Queensland, discussed the study's findings from a food questionnaire on The Conversation website. They queried participants about the frequency of their egg consumption in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals reported their egg consumption as rare—possibly once a month, 1-6 times a week, or daily. The researchers observed, "Overall, people who consumed eggs 1–6 times per week had the lowest risk of death during the study period (29% lower for heart disease deaths and 17% lower for overall deaths) compared to those who rarely or never ate eggs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, they clarified, "Eating eggs daily did not increase the risk of death either."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the cholesterol content leading some to demonize eggs due to potential health impacts, this study offers a more encouraging perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High cholesterol often lurks in the shadows, ominously dubbed the "silent killer" due to its symptom-free presence until it starkly manifests in serious health issues like heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:48:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwFBVV95cUxPR0FicG14MlNxYzNXQlRtYTBUMGw2QWlSS2hLbUM4RHNpdS1wNGNZWFJwMjY1SXU0aTdWeE1aMnFENDJFTGRraU9ZOUxHcGtLMUNLRmdWTU5xUDZaSTg5Y2VsOU9vekFkcUNUYjZpLUFveGlOUnU2RDJPQ0hyRVVCbWFTcXJhaGptcE0w0gGQAUFVX3lxTE0waFdRaU9iaFhSdDUzd0dFMnNHTUd6RHdQMUxxOW1GbW5jdERXTGcwMWVCV19PU1RKS3lJdnRod3ZDUUc5d1NES3BmSWVqZGhGYmx5dWd0NHhFMXc1bG5pa0ZfRU9qNlNJWG1Ncmg0X2kzQkZ2bjJReV94Tm9MOHNwZ1N6R211U25XY2JjeWVTcQ</guid></item><item><title>Measles outbreak could last a year, health official in Texas says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQQ3FSTFlRSnN4Y0lHYThyT2xodTBGQ2NwSGlkT3ZGcGFTY1lwMHF6eGF3LTY4U2M2ME0zMVltTndUakNOWF96S3ZVRFJ0aF9vSnJzaEd0THRDeExrSXFmTFlMd1RLcTFmenZCanhvZkxyR2JCRnpXcmZCLVdkWGRQN0xvOVBZRTR0NnNWb0xWZEEyZy1DR2fSAYwBQVVfeXFMTy1CeHRfMzExYUNRdUx6bEtLT0o4ZnhwSkFUWS0wVnRzRXVIN0xTMUNxVWtJLXhoUmFkdVBYOEwtaGhXcnB2a1BvS2NxcjU3YWluZDBwc0lzWklacGx6U2R6NUtBZS1iMjJNWFhieS02bTFIQ1VjY0JqOTdtMVEwS1VPMDlEOGxlNU9Kc1o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Three hundred and twenty-one cases have been reported in the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, the states said Tuesday. This is an increase of 25 cases since an update on Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000c3b5v5qu6qps3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Texas has reported 279 outbreak-associated cases, New Mexico has reported 38 cases, and Oklahoma had previously reported four cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000d3b5v2r0cfspz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thirty-eight patients have been hospitalized, an increase of two over last week. Ninety-five cases are in children up to age 4, and 130 are among young people ages 5 to 17. Cases have been identified in 11 Texas counties and two New Mexico counties.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000e3b5v89day62j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Texas, the bulk of the cases, 191, are in Gaines County, where the outbreak was first identified. In New Mexico, most cases are in Lea County, which borders Gaines County.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The &lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html" target="_blank"&gt;Oklahoma State Department of Health&lt;/a&gt; said last week that it had four measles cases in people with “exposure associated with the Texas and New Mexico outbreak.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpp000g3b5vk5car7q3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although most of the cases are in people who were unvaccinated or who had unknown vaccination status, six were found in people who said they have received at least one dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine: two in Texas and four in New Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000h3b5v0peba4em@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last month, Texas announced the outbreak’s first death, a school-age child who was not vaccinated and had no underlying conditions. Health officials in New Mexico are continuing to investigate the cause of death of an unvaccinated person who tested positive for measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2tu000023b5vtze33pvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given the highly contagious nature of the disease, officials expect continued spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000j3b5v6k1xb69q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases. … I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000k3b5vgyjkqsji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just think, it being so rural now, multistate, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000l3b5vk7p11roe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, officials say that increased testing capacity will be helpful in containing the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000m3b5vxjztejrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Labs have been set up in Lubbock, close to the epicenter of the outbreak. This means specimens no longer need to be sent via plane to Austin, reducing the time to get results from 72 hours to the same day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000n3b5vocpq0hji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At Tuesday’s briefing, officials noted that identifying cases, exposures and unvaccinated people was critical in curtailing a measles outbreak in Chicago last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000o3b5vevnq94ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as we continue to have a pool of unvaccinated people, it will continue to spread. So it’s very hard to say it has peaked unless you have successfully vaccinated everyone who is unvaccinated,” said Dr. Olusimbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000p3b5v36irgtwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html#:~:text=Over%2030%2C000%20doses%20of%20measleswithout%20the%20City's%20rapid%20intervention." target="_blank"&gt;30,000&lt;/a&gt; MMR vaccinations were given to Chicago residents during the outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which kept it from crossing the 100-case mark, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a2.htm?s_cid=mm7319a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the outbreak stopped at 64 reported cases, most of them linked to a shelter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epulfv00003b5vd39sxuwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to a CNN tally, there have been at least 353 cases reported in the US as of March 18. This already surpasses the total number of cases for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000j3b5v1kisi7c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were 285 total measles cases reported in the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is only the third year since measles was eliminated in the US in 2000 that an outbreak has led to more 200 cases. The others were 2014, when there was an outbreak tied to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/health/disneyland-measles/index.html"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, and 2019, when a nearly year-long outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt; came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000b3b5v8lb9wv16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has been assisting efforts on the ground in Texas, and Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, says local efforts are “dependent” on federal support.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000c3b5vzsabgj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our staffing to be able to do vaccination clinics and our epidemiology staff to do the investigations and contact tracing … so much of that is federally funded that we are very dependent on and very concerned about some of the potential staffing cuts that we’re seeing at the federal level, as well as some of the budget cuts,” he said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2tu000023b5vtze33pvh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Given the highly contagious nature of the disease, officials expect continued spread.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000j3b5v6k1xb69q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is going to be a large outbreak, and we are still on the side where we are increasing the number of cases. … I’m really thinking this is going to be a year long,” Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, said at a briefing Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000k3b5vgyjkqsji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I just think, it being so rural now, multistate, it’s just going to take a lot more boots on the ground, a lot more work to get things under control. It’s not an isolated population.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000l3b5vk7p11roe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, officials say that increased testing capacity will be helpful in containing the outbreak.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000m3b5vxjztejrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Labs have been set up in Lubbock, close to the epicenter of the outbreak. This means specimens no longer need to be sent via plane to Austin, reducing the time to get results from 72 hours to the same day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000n3b5vocpq0hji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At Tuesday’s briefing, officials noted that identifying cases, exposures and unvaccinated people was critical in curtailing a measles outbreak in Chicago last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000o3b5vevnq94ye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As long as we continue to have a pool of unvaccinated people, it will continue to spread. So it’s very hard to say it has peaked unless you have successfully vaccinated everyone who is unvaccinated,” said Dr. Olusimbo Ige, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew5x09000p3b5v36irgtwm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/health_protection_and_response/news/2024/may/cdph-press-release-05-30-2024.html#:~:text=Over%2030%2C000%20doses%20of%20measleswithout%20the%20City's%20rapid%20intervention." target="_blank"&gt;30,000&lt;/a&gt; MMR vaccinations were given to Chicago residents during the outbreak,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which kept it from crossing the 100-case mark, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7319a2.htm?s_cid=mm7319a2_w" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the outbreak stopped at 64 reported cases, most of them linked to a shelter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epulfv00003b5vd39sxuwf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to a CNN tally, there have been at least 353 cases reported in the US as of March 18. This already surpasses the total number of cases for all of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8epykpq000j3b5v1kisi7c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, there were 285 total measles cases reported in the US, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is only the third year since measles was eliminated in the US in 2000 that an outbreak has led to more 200 cases. The others were 2014, when there was an outbreak tied to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/20/health/disneyland-measles/index.html"&gt;Disneyland&lt;/a&gt;, and 2019, when a nearly year-long outbreak &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-outbreak-new-york-2019-lessons-learned/index.html"&gt;in New York&lt;/a&gt; came within weeks of ending elimination status in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000b3b5v8lb9wv16@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC has been assisting efforts on the ground in Texas, and Dr. Philip Huang, director of Dallas County Health and Human Services, says local efforts are “dependent” on federal support.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8ew2vlo000c3b5vzsabgj1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our staffing to be able to do vaccination clinics and our epidemiology staff to do the investigations and contact tracing … so much of that is federally funded that we are very dependent on and very concerned about some of the potential staffing cuts that we’re seeing at the federal level, as well as some of the budget cuts,” he said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

The boxes are cardboard and contain individual plastic packages of products. The lot code and best-by date 11152026 is stamped on products. The pet food was distributed in California, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="N4R3FEPUZBBIPDBX2JJK337HRE"&gt;New York City health officials this week urged consumers to avoid Savage Pet products because of the cats' illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GDVAKAR3ENFTVASQD2NOLJTT6Y"&gt;One cat fell ill and died this month after eating the Savage Pet products. Final test results are pending, but a preliminary test for H5N1 was “nonnegative,” which indicates that a certain amount of virus was detected, a department spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WU5OMVCLVRGB3GTERA2Y4FRN5E"&gt;A second cat was diagnosed with H5N1 and died — and tests suggested it was infected with a strain related to that found in the recalled Savage Pet food. However, that cat did not eat the food; it was exposed to a third cat that fell ill after eating the food from the implicated lot. That cat survived but was not tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UWQD2WN6XFBNJHJ75Q2LKF7CLE"&gt;The New York cases are the latest reports of cats in several states sickened and killed by H5N1.

This is because &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; can help us “stay vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades”, says Ollie Thompson, personal trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://welltolead.com/"&gt;Welltolead&lt;/a&gt;, a performance-focused health coaching company. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my opinion, the benefits of maintaining healthy muscle are highly underrated,” he says. “Resistance training is crucial for long-term &lt;a href="/news/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; – not just from a movement perspective, staying physically strong and mobile, but also for maintaining overall physiological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistent resistance training enhances metabolic function by improving insulin sensitivity, supports cardiovascular health by reducing &lt;a href="/topic/blood-pressure"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="/topic/inflammation"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, helps maintain hormonal balance to combat age-related declines, preserves bone density to reduce fracture risk, and strengthens the immune system to help fight off disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to help you build strength, Thompson has shared three &lt;a href="/topic/gyms"&gt;gym&lt;/a&gt; exercises he believes hold the most value if training for &lt;a href="/topic/longevity"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; is your goal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-2 epFywa EqCSl"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assisted chin-up &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bulgarian split squat &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Farmer’s carry &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 kULwBk fWblEi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Based on my experience, if we define longevity as living better for longer – with an emphasis on staying vibrant, physically independent and disease-free in our final decades – then these are the top three gym exercises for longevity,” says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When combined, they can strengthen muscles across your upper and lower body, boosting joint health, developing balance and coordination, and improving your posture, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/anne-hathaway-workout-trainer-plank-b2695184.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This one-move workout from Anne Hathaway’s trainer builds core stability in just three minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do an assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/56/Personal-trainer-Ollie-thompson-demonstrating-an-assisted-chin-up.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74391"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie thompson demonstrating an assisted chin-up&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place a barbell in a rack at roughly chest height. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sit on the ground under the barbell then reach overhead and grasp it with an underhand grip, hands roughly shoulder-width apart. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your feet on the floor for support, pull your body upwards until your chin is above the bar. Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you do this. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slowly control yourself back to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over time, try to provide less support with your feet to make the exercise more challenging, in line with your increasing strength levels. You can also use an assisted pull-up machine or resistance band to perform this exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the assisted chin-up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/courteney-cox-chin-up-workout-b2625004.html"&gt;chin-up&lt;/a&gt; has a somewhat intimidating reputation. But by using a machine, resistance band or even a lower pull-up bar and supporting yourself with your feet, Thompson says it can be scaled to suit most fitness levels. And adding it to your regular routine unlocks plenty of benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up not only recruits multiple muscles across your back, biceps, forearms and core, but it’s also one of the best things you can do to develop a healthy set of shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key reason I picked the assisted chin-up is that performing a full repetition – from a dead hang to the top with your chin at the bar – takes your shoulder blades through a full range of motion,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the bottom hanging position, with your hands supinated [palms towards you], you create external rotation at the shoulder joint while under load with your arms overhead – an excellent way to maintain strong, stable and well-functioning shoulders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this exercise can’t be beaten for training grip strength, which &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6778477/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have strongly correlated with healthier muscle mass and better longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/stanley-tucci-workout-b2630043.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Tucci got into the ‘best shape of his life’ at 63 with this training method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/36/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-demonstrating-a-Bulgarian-split-squat.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74392"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson demonstrating a Bulgarian split squat&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand one step in front of a bench or sturdy surface that’s around knee height. Face away from this surface. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in your left hand with your arm by your side, palm facing your body. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right leg long and your hips square, place the top of your left foot on the bench behind you. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lower your left knee until it’s just above the ground, keeping your chest up as you do this, then drive through your right foot to return to the starting position. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Bulgarian split squat &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chin-up promises to strengthen multiple muscles across your upper body, and the Bulgarian split squat mirrors this for your lower half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a unilateral [single-limb] exercise, it’s excellent for building strength and stability at the hip, knee and foot, helping to correct severe muscular imbalances while also incorporating a balance component,” says Thompson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also challenges kinaesthetic awareness – your ability to sense your position and movement in space – which is a crucial skill for preventing trips and falls in later life.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some impressive longevity credentials, and the Bulgarian split squat has another trick up its sleeve that elevates it above standard &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, in Thompson’s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a huge fan of this exercise because, when performed correctly, it not only engages every major muscle in the leg but also forces you into hip extension,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This position, where the leg moves behind the hip and midline, tends to weaken significantly with age. Developing strength and mobility in this range plays a key role in maintaining movement quality and walking mechanics, and it can also be instrumental in reducing back pain, hip pain and dysfunction in these areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps a day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to do the farmer’s carry &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 JinrT"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/19/11/21/Personal-trainer-Ollie-Thompson-performing-a-farmers-carry.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-74393"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Personal trainer Ollie Thompson performing a farmer's carry&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Ollie Thompson / Welltolead)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 epFywa fsVXVg"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell in each hand with your arms by your side and your palms facing inwards. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright torso and tight core, walk with the weights. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the farmer’s carry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The farmer’s carry is a refreshingly straightforward exercise: simply pick up a couple of &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-dumbbells-home-hand-weights-b1847563.html"&gt;dumbbells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-kettlebell-set-workout-b1837551.html"&gt;kettlebells&lt;/a&gt; and take them for a walk. This simplicity means it’s overlooked, but Thompson says those who omit it are missing out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The farmer’s carry is an exercise I don’t see performed nearly as often as it should be. Here’s why: it’s a full-body movement that involves ambulation, it tests your grip strength and it’s fantastic for improving posture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It builds strong joints, enhances hip stability, challenges your balance, coordination and kinaesthetic awareness, and ultimately provides a brilliant way to build strength while also taxing your aerobic system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, it will bolster your heart and lung health by having you breathing heavily, while also strengthening your entire body. The farmer’s carry is a viable option for the vast majority of people too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I often prescribe farmer's carries to my online clients because they are incredibly accessible and can be scaled easily, with progress easily tracked. Simply pick a challenging kettlebell or dumbbell, then walk for time, distance, steps or breaths. This way, you can keep track of how your performance improves over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/kettlebell-training-loaded-carries-b2691274.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘This will change your life’ – An expert strength coach shares the training method missing from your workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other things to consider when training for longevity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance training is Thompson’s top recommendation when exercising for longevity. But he says cardiovascular exercise – activities that raise your heart rate for a sustained period – should also be among your top priorities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cardiovascular exercise is, of course, essential for heart health, but it also plays a critical role in mitochondrial function, reducing the risk of major diseases and cancers, supporting brain health, enhancing energy production, improving sleep quality and managing stress,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As well as resistance training, a well-rounded approach to exercising for longevity includes both low-intensity zone two cardio [performed at roughly 60-70 per cent of your maximum heart rate] and short bouts of high-intensity training. This combination builds both a wide aerobic base and a high aerobic peak – known as VO2 max – which is strongly associated with better health, longevity, and reduced all-cause mortality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/isle-of-man-wellness-retreat-b2696904.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I went on my first wellness retreat, and it wasn’t what I expected at all&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNTl9sWkJCUENacWhpNEdKMVFXZ1V6akYxVjFkNlM4bHdLMEdDVkE5SXFGZk9TUHJXeDRuZTdiRU4xcTZiS3FOR0s3NGNXb2Yzc1lpbjNDTGhkTU9XdlF0RUlDR1lKMGdseG5wTmEwdjl4RVFCdGRNR0hSM3JjdldEM0p4dTM1WndFNGxZRkN1QmFWVDNWNFhHMHRtWVJjb0FvYi1tTGN3</guid></item><item><title>One food lowers blood pressure 'as effectively as beta blockers' - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxOOU5aR1JXVGpnWUR3ZGJYVTQyTnh1SW5aaFpsLUdDVkRHald6cG1VZnZBbHU4TzNpVVpKUEJBd0NsRVdBOFVvb1VnWDN0VlMwRHhRNllwQ08tSW9ya2NZRXdHMUFyVlhoTlFVcklseDBJcGo1TDdGSXF0R2t6c0I4Y3F0SzBQdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is a potentially lethal condition made even more dangerous by the fact that it can have no symptoms until you fall seriously ill. High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high. Over time, this can lead to serious health complications, even if there are no immediate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can lead to heart attacks and strokes, heart failure, aneurysms, kidney failure, blindness and dementia as well as erectile dysfunction - among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition, which is detected through a simple, blood pressure test using a cuff inflated around the arm, is usually treated with lifestyle changes and medication. But one expert says there is also another solution you can add to help bring blood pressure down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Karen Keane, lecturer at Northumbria University, Newcastle, said drinking cherry concentrate can lower blood pressure for up to three hours. She told &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cherry-concentrate-can-lower-blood-pressure-as-much-as-drugs-our-study-finds-58521" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; : "Tart Montmorency cherries are rich in a number of plant compounds that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. In cell and animal models, cherry extracts have been shown to have a range of cardiovascular health effects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the biggest killer, globally. In Europe, CVD is the leading cause of death in adults and is responsible for nearly half (48%) of all deaths. And in the US, 25% of deaths are attributed to CVD – that’s about 610,000 premature deaths each year. Raised blood pressure is the greatest risk factor for cardiovascular disease and even small reductions in blood pressure can have a big impact on mortality rates."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Northumbria University has undertaken a number of studies into the health benefits of tart Montmorency cherry concentrate. Karen said: "We have have found that drinking the concentrate improves the quality and quantity of sleep. It also reduces gout symptoms."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added: "In this study, we examined the acute effects of the consumption of Montmorency tart cherries on arterial stiffness, blood pressure and dilation of small blood vessels in men with early hypertension. Sixteen non-smoking men with early hypertension (with systolic blood pressure of 130mmHg or above, and diastolic blood pressure of 80mmHg or above – or both) took part in the study. At the start of the study, the participants provided a blood sample and we assessed their general cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Each participant then received either Montmorency tart cherry concentrate, diluted with water, or a placebo (fruit cordial). We took blood samples and assessed cardiovascular function one, two, three, five and eight hours after they drank the juice. Blood pressure was taken hourly. No food or drink was provided during the study period except for mineral water. Each person returned to the lab at least two weeks after the first visit to repeat the test with the other intervention drink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to show that drinking cherry juice can lower systolic blood pressure. Previous studies have demonstrated that foods such as cocoa, beetroot, and grape extract can also have a positive effect on blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Our study is particularly noteworthy because data from observational studies have shown that lowering average (mean) systolic blood pressure by 5-6mmHg over a five-year period is associated with a 38% reduced risk of stroke and a 23% reduced risk of coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Compared with the placebo, we found that cherry juice concentrate reduced peak blood pressure by 7mmHG. The blood pressure lowering effects of cherry juice are comparable to those achieved by some antihypertensive drugs – such as beta blockers and diuretics – in people with mild hypertension. Our findings suggest that Montmorency cherries could be used alongside standard treatment to manage hypertension."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:17:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgFBVV95cUxOOU5aR1JXVGpnWUR3ZGJYVTQyTnh1SW5aaFpsLUdDVkRHald6cG1VZnZBbHU4TzNpVVpKUEJBd0NsRVdBOFVvb1VnWDN0VlMwRHhRNllwQ08tSW9ya2NZRXdHMUFyVlhoTlFVcklseDBJcGo1TDdGSXF0R2t6c0I4Y3F0SzBQdw</guid></item><item><title>Debunked myths that vaccines cause autism are increasing stigma - The Guardian US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTFBuQ2VpTzVOQ0tkVFFuVVBaMXdzSkw3b0J4YlNPaEtBWkhCLWVyU0V2SVhnWVMwb2pNeDJQY1Z3bkU0ZnhTS2VKRi1JLS13ajRfZzFMLVVraW5aLVZwbHREVkdfZHFRNmNzTHdPNDZ1b2VCZUY4NUlDMjB4dEZNeTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector  dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/cdc-study-vaccines-autism" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;planning to devote research dollars&lt;/a&gt;

Many autistic people make it to adulthood without a diagnosis – despite the challenges that come even with mild cases, they are able to live independently. Others require lifetime support. While autism as a disability is defined by impairments, it is also associated with strengths, including &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/aut.2021.0037" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dedication, focus and creativity in the workplace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Even in more challenging cases, parents of autistic children find it repugnant that other parents are risking their own children’s serious illness or death, ostensibly to avoid the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kate Abarca, a retired occupational therapist in South Carolina, says that learning to understand her son’s autism was immensely rewarding. Caring for him made her a better therapist, and advocating for him helped her overcome her shyness. Now 35, her son Benjamin Beals is beloved in his community. He lives in a semi-independent facility and is known for his karaoke performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="ff65e2ed-405a-4187-b78a-019a27fe87c1" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":13,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Measles outbreak spreads as 250 cases reported across multiple states","elementId":"ff65e2ed-405a-4187-b78a-019a27fe87c1","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/measles-outbreak-spread"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":6,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Abarca realized early that her son’s difficulties stemmed from her own inability to understand his needs.

Knapp, along with others contacted for this story, suspects that anti-vaxxers see autism as a combination of exaggerated stereotypes stemming from misunderstood behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Knapp was diagnosed with autism at 63.

It is possible that the version found in the chickens is circulating in wild birds, but most researchers think it probably acquired it’s deadly attributes once it got into the Noxubee chicken operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that’s the case, “my money is on a one-and-done, perhaps with some local spread,” said Richard Webby, an infectious disease expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webby said most bird flu outbreaks follow that pattern: A low-pathogenic version is introduced to commercial poultry, and it becomes highly pathogenic once inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of H5N1 — the bird flu virus that’s been infecting dairy cows, commercial poultry, pet cats, wild animals and wild birds since March 2024 — into poultry and livestock populations was a notable exception to this trend: It was already circulating among wild birds and animals as a highly pathogenic virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Korslund, a veterinarian and former USDA researcher, agreed with Webby and noted that the operation housed breeder broilers: Chickens that are grown and maintained for breeding purposes, not for their meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is significant because breeders live for months, if not years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a low-pathogenic virus “happens to get into a broiler meat flock, the birds don’t get sick and they go onto slaughter,” he said. But when a breeder flock picks up that virus, “the virus can replicate for weeks ... this may well be what happened in Mississippi.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-9/chapter-I/subchapter-G/part-145" target="_blank"&gt;USDA rules&lt;/a&gt;, routine and periodic testing of breeder birds for low-pathogenic avian influenzas is required. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/usda-avian-influenza-factsheet.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;In 2017, an outbreak of H7N9 &lt;/a&gt;occurred along the Mississippi flyway, probably starting in late February, but reported only in March. A summary report of the outbreak suggested the virus was introduced via wild birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As suspected in this case, it is believed it started as “low path” and only became “high path” once it got into the commercial operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, experts said, if they are wrong and a highly pathogenic virus is circulating in wild birds, it’ll start popping up in other states and sites too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Time will tell how nasty it gets this time,” Korslund said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to preventing these kinds of outbreaks — or at least getting ahead of them — is wildlife surveillance, the experts said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agencies such as the USDA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Wildlife Health Center, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have divisions that are tasked with sampling wild birds and other animals for infectious diseases. The information they gather is then used by agriculture and public health officials to determine where and when to bolster biosecurity, or to keep a lookout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without that information, said &lt;a class="link" href="https://angelarasmussen.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Angela Rasmussen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Canada.”we’re flying blind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the positive news that came out this week, &lt;a class="link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1485_article?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1315-DM145916&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Influenza%20Articles%20in%20the%20March%202025%20Emerging%20Infectious%20Diseases%20Journal&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_1315-DM145916" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a team of international &lt;a class="link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/3/24-1485_article?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_1315-DM145916&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=Influenza%20Articles%20in%20the%20March%202025%20Emerging%20Infectious%20Diseases%20Journal&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_1315-DM145916" target="_blank"&gt;researchers found that&lt;/a&gt; ferrets  exposed to a common seasonal human flu — H1N1 — before being exposed to H5N1, acquire some immunity from the seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferrets that weren’t exposed to the seasonal flu before being infected with H5N1 had high levels of the virus in their respiratory tissues, as well as detectable virus in their hearts, spleen, liver and intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, those that had been exposed to the seasonal flu beforehand had virus only in the respiratory tract — and at pretty low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest take home message of our data is that prior human seasonal virus infection can provide some level of protection against the lethality of bird flu,” said Seema Lakdawala, a microbiologist at Emory University in Atlanta and one of the study’s researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webby, the St. Jude researcher, said the work supports other research that has looked at the potential protectiveness of prior exposure to flu viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is for sure playing some role in modulating H5N1 disease in humans,” he said, but was unlikely the only factor. “After all, many people have severe seasonal H1N1 infections each year despite lots of immunity to the virus from previous H1N1 exposures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the finding may help explain why the virus recently has been associated with generally mild disease in the people who have been infected. Seventy people in the U.S. have been infected since March 2024, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-01-06/first-us-h5n1-bird-flu-death"&gt;one person has died.&lt;/a&gt; (Four people, including the Louisiana patient who died, have been hospitalized).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before last year, the virus was thought to have killed roughly 50% of those infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasmussen said the worry now is that if H5N1 mutates to become transmissible between people, it’ll be young children as well as the old and compromised who are likely to be most affected. Children younger than 5 are less likely to have been exposed to seasonal human influenza viruses than school-aged children and adults — potentially making them more susceptible to the harms of a virus such as H5N1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she said, the bird flu viruses circulating in birds and livestock “as far as we know, can’t transmit easily between people. But, if there’s reassortment, then who knows? We don’t know what kind of residual population-level immunity we would have” from a virus such as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How seasonal flu vaccines could affect this protection isn’t clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seasonal vaccines will not provide the same diversity of immune response as natural infection and unlikely to provide the same level of protection,” said Lakdawala, who is testing this issue in the lab.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 10:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxQNXJORGE4b1BmMklOMjhnMVo0Vzk0UG1hRV9RdjNRQXZQcGpMbURGZlpyY1BtUGFQMG9IdXhnV1RmdGZYVm5LMUd3NkJRUmJWYXk0UTQ3YmNnWkxJNDdmNFFsZS12NG9zWHItZjJ5WGZSRm5fbWZ3eWdOWlJjTGpqQ3JHTE1lTUJnX1lYaUxXbi00SGJUOEJFYVg2bGVPNWtUdURTUVhLVkRxeTZtX1dEc2FRNk94b29nbi1NNGtR</guid></item><item><title>Help!

It started with her participating in Dry January and me deciding not to. Neither of us drinks that much, I didn’t feel the need to examine my relationship with alcohol or feel the effects of abstaining from it as I have unconsciously gone more than a month without drinking alcohol before. Even though I morally supported her, I did not go out of my way to shield her from alcohol (she is not going through an addiction recovery program after all—she is a 33-year-old challenging herself).&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exzu0s00323b73jxhibsj3@published"&gt;The whole month she would get upset if I had a glass of wine with dinner or wanted to go to lunch at our favorite brewery, which has a lot of nonalcoholic options and which she typically doesn’t even order alcoholic drinks when we go. Even me choosing brunch at the place with the “best Blood Mary in town” (her words) was seen as me not being supportive.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="162" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0i001u3b73bi7t5s1u@published"&gt;It has now evolved into me not supporting her fitness journey because I won’t participate in the things she does or diet. I don’t believe in diets. I was a wrestler in my youth and had a messed up relationship with food. I have since learned to eat and exercise in moderation and to enjoy both things. I support her goals—I encourage her, ask her about how her training is going, or how she’s liking various exercise classes or strength training sessions but I don’t want to join her in them. Apparently, by not wanting to go on a strenuous hike on a Sunday afternoon I’m being unsupportive. I was fine going on an easy to moderate hike but she wants to turn everything into a workout. I picked up Chipotle for us the other day and got her the healthy bowl option that she wanted but I was being “unsupportive” because I got my usual with extra guac and sour cream.&lt;/p&gt;

But what if I don’t want to go to a hot yoga class (why is all yoga heated these days?!), or if I’d rather read a book than go on a walk after dinner every evening? How can I explain to her that being supportive doesn’t actually mean participating?&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to me that your girlfriend is confusing “being supportive” with “adjusting your behaviors to match mine exactly.” That’s a pretty controlling mindset. If she’s unable to tolerate your status as an independent person who is allowed to make lifestyle choices that are different from hers—and if she treats every one of your aberrant choices as a direct affront to hers—then I’m not sure there’s much of a future in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="85" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8exvk0l001z3b735gdgx401@published"&gt;Tell your girlfriend that if she needs a partner whose lifestyle will match hers exactly, she may have to start looking for a new partner. A healthy relationship often pushes us to change our habits, but the desire has to be mutual, and these expectations still need to take everyone’s preferences and sensitivities into consideration. One person does not get to call all of the shots; in this situation, being accused of being “unsupportive” sounds a lot more like you’re being accused of being “disobedient.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8ewrh0k001n1gm4edtca0bo@published"&gt;My aunt is a doctor. I recently learned that before we were together, my fiancé incessantly messaged her office and wrote negative reviews, all because it didn’t support a therapy that very few doctors support—although apparently specialists to whom my aunt has referred people for other issues do support the therapy in question, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/11/dear-prudie-fiance-harassed-aunt-negative-reviews.html"&gt;which seems to be why my fiancé thought he could get things changed.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The patient: &lt;/strong&gt;A 17-year-old boy in the Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The symptoms: &lt;/strong&gt;The teenager was admitted to a hospital in the Netherlands for knee surgery after getting injured while playing soccer. The surgery was successful, but when the patient woke up from the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/33731-anesthesia-work.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anesthesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he spoke exclusively in English and insisted "repeatedly" that he was in the U.S. Prior to this incident, he spoke the language only during English class in school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not recognize his parents and could not speak or understand spoken Dutch, his native language. According to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-021-03236-z" target="_blank" data-url="https://jmedicalcasereports.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13256-021-03236-z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report doctors wrote about his case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the patient had no history of psychiatric symptoms and no relevant medical family history, apart from some instances of depression on his mother's side of the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next:&lt;/strong&gt; The nurse who initially noticed the patient speaking English was not immediately worried by it, thinking the teen was experiencing&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7714637/#:~:text=Emergence%20delirium%20(ED)%20is%20an,behavior%20%5B8%2C12%5D." target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7714637/#:~:text=Emergence%20delirium%20(ED)%20is%20an,behavior%20%5B8%2C12%5D." referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;emergence delirium&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a state of confusion that can occur during recovery from anesthesia. However, when medical staff still could not get the patient to speak a single word of Dutch a few hours later, they called for a psychiatric consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/can-you-forget-your-native-language" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/mind/can-you-forget-your-native-language"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you forget your native language?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The psychiatric team found the patient relaxed and attentive. He was able to answer questions, albeit in English spoken with a Dutch accent. Later on, he started to give short answers in Dutch but found it difficult to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;The 17-year-old was diagnosed with foreign language syndrome (FLS), which happens when patients suddenly and involuntarily switch to using a second language instead of their native language for a period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; A neurologist found no abnormalities during a full neurological examination of the patient. Then, 18 hours after his surgery, the teen was able to understand Dutch but still couldn't speak it. Some of the teen's friends came to visit him the day after his surgery, and suddenly, he was able to understand and speak Dutch again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the teen spontaneously started speaking in his native language again, doctors saw no need to run any neuropsychological tests, electroencephalograms (EEG) or other types of brain scans on him. He was discharged three days post-surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;FLS is rare, with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_6185554598107295609&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12991-024-00538-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-after-surgery-a-17-year-old-could-speak-only-a-foreign-language" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12991-024-00538-6" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2Fs12991-024-00538-6&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fdiagnostic-dilemma-after-surgery-a-17-year-old-could-speak-only-a-foreign-language" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about nine cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described in medical literature.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;In most of these cases, the patient was a white male who switched from their native language to another one they had learned later in life; the patients weren't typically bilingual growing up. The race of the patients in two cases was not documented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors of the case report said FLS is rarely seen in children, and they suspected that they were the first to formally document a case of FLS in an adolescent. In total, they found eight reported cases of FLS that were similar to that of their patient, in which the person affected switched to a completely different language rather than speaking in a way that could be perceived as a foreign accent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what happens in a related condition — &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/italian-womans-rare-foreign-accent-syndrome-caused-her-to-sound-canadian" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/italian-womans-rare-foreign-accent-syndrome-caused-her-to-sound-canadian"&gt;&lt;u&gt;called foreign accent syndrome&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — in which people adopt a speech pattern that makes it sound like they're speaking with an accent. The rare condition has often, but not always, been seen in the context of brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly why FLS happens is unknown, although there have been other cases in which the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216510/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39216510/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;syndrome emerges after anesthesia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The case report authors noted that an anesthetic's effects on cognition, as well as the clearance of anesthetic drugs from the central nervous system, can lead to emergence delirium. For that reason, they're not sure if FLS can be classified as a distinct condition or merely a variation of emergence delirium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP-MYwcVa3wTQxHK54UMjbvpqgWJCwrpZ9k" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-LXjPMVKD9GS5yvbVjwHTWP-MYwcVa3wTQxHK54UMjbvpqgWJCwrpZ9k slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Dr Adriana Quinones-Camacho, a cardiologist, said cholesterol has been 'shown to be problematic for heart health'. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Bad cholesterol refers to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which can build up in the walls of your arteries, leading to plaque formation. This plaque narrows and hardens the arteries, increasing the risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;LDL contributes to atherosclerosis (artery hardening), increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and can cause reduced blood flow to vital organs. High LDL levels are caused by factors including, an unhealthy diet (high in saturated and trans fats), lack of exercise, smoking, genetics (familial hypercholesterolemia), obesity and certain medical conditions such as diabetes and hypothyroidism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Heart conditions, and high cholesterol, are often managed with medication called statins - taken by millions of people in the UK every day. But Dr Quinones-Camacho says a doctor will try to help you make lifestyle changes first. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; These changes could be more effective than statins at bringing your cholesterol down permanently, and improving your heart health. The four recommended changes are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consume Fats Wisely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The type of fats you consume has a huge impact on cholesterol levels. Foods high in omega-3 fatty acids, like walnuts, salmon, flaxseeds and mackerel have cardiovascular benefits that have been studied extensively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less Sugar, More Fibre&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emphasizing fibre in your diet can help reduce high cholesterol. Fibre reduces the absorption of cholesterol into your bloodstream and can lead to significant improvements for someone with high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Make Time For Exercise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study in 'Sports Medicine' found that almost any kind of exercise can have a major impact on cholesterol. Another study suggests that psychological stress was also a contributing factor to high cholesterol, and physical activity could mitigate that risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Refer to Your Doctor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Talking to your doctor can help determine lifestyle changes you should make along with any medication that may be a good fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 09:47:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxObU1jOUh5OFEyaFdnbWx6UEZPSzNVUG5zeEtTY2JPQ1dwam5NcDUwb1BFc0FwZ2laSlZrenB1ajBmQ3FwdVNvei0tOHBMUm1SXzJxaVJIU0lZX3J5RjE5a0RuTTJWYU9jc3dONUFpSW1fYlVSVDZLMU10SDRYczJFY0FTMFdJUmtZZ2pYOA</guid></item><item><title>The Lifesaving Items That Doctors Always Pack On Vacation - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNMEd1Rk9ISlhMeHd5aHl4RXVnSXlvXzlDbF9uUG1FS0EtTU9qczBKZVM0YzFpTXdJal9tNjVtdy1ybVNweUhfSjVYRzg1RnlfVnBjcU9OallQVndwQXFvb1hrQmNrRC1fbG1ab2JZWTI1LW5Vd1JpRThaMzNCUlQ5X1FYZVJkV1NSdjRUOHZKQU5VbTJ0Q3Jj0gGcAUFVX3lxTFA3SHhTTXRLWndZQ3JXaGtiMEh6TENweFA2bGMzOTVMNVRLeXVwcTBrenpyUjdBeDVjVXlSbkptVDI5RFdvOXNtdVpkZWpKdVRYUmFWVTZhckJibnNOSk1iSzdPakVHT0tqMlQ0VThaRnBFS3g3LTROVDUxa2tmOEVkQWsxY1BRRThScjhaaHVuOEd4d1kwbE5XalpoWA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My idea of &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/life/travel" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="travel " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d9d08ae4b0e9567a99d8a9" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/life/travel" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;travel &lt;/a&gt;preparedness doesn’t always take into account the many mishaps that could potentially occur when venturing away from home.

&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons to get stronger, but often, what motivates you changes as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, very few 20-year-olds exercise to maintain their independence but that takes on greater importance in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I asked Hayley Madigan—a trainer, sports scientist and Oner Active athlete—about the best exercises to do if you’re new to exercise and over 65, she suggested focusing on functional everyday movements, like squats and step-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're older and maybe you live on your own, how are you gonna get your shopping bags upstairs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to be able to do step-ups. I want to be able to squat down. I want to be able to deadlift my bag from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And those are all functional movements that are taught in weight training," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no need to start with weights if you're new to strength training. The most important thing is to begin at the appropriate level and gradually increase the difficulty as you get stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZWi8BagHxaMdE2pRSq799T" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZWi8BagHxaMdE2pRSq799T slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help, Madigan has provided options for each exercise so it suits your fitness level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-exercises"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the exercises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-squat-to-chair"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

Step-up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets:&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;Reps:&lt;/strong&gt; 6-8 each side&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stand in front of a slightly elevated surface, like a step or weight plate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Place one foot on the elevated surface and push through your heel to extend your leg and rise.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bring your other foot on the elevated surface, then step back down carefully and with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeat the move, leading with the opposite foot. Continue, alternating sides with each step.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it easier: Lower the elevated surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make it harder: Choose a higher surface or hold a weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why step-ups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step-ups are another exercise that targets your glutes, along with your hamstrings and quads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These large muscles support your knee joint, so strengthening them can help you avoid some knee problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Step-ups are a really important one for knee strength and knee health, and also hip health, and that's really important for us as we get older," says Madigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative to this move is &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/lunges-bodyweight-exercises" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/lunges-bodyweight-exercises"&gt;lunges&lt;/a&gt;, but Madigan cautions that this exercise can be tricky if you have sore knees.&lt;/p&gt;

If you do notice you have a dry cough after you start a new medication, it’s important to notify your physician so they can monitor, Addrizzo-Harris said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If your cough brings up mucus, this is a sign of what experts call a productive cough. The type of sputum (a mix of mucus and saliva) that you cough up can hint at what’s causing it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Is it clear? Is it … yellow or green? Is it bloody? … Usually the darker the color [and] the thicker the sputum, there’s a lot more inflammatory cells in [it], often white blood cells mixed with bacteria,” Addrizzo-Harris said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you notice the color of your sputum is starting to change color, this could be an early sign of a bacterial infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; If this happens, reach out to your doctor because you may need to start antibiotics, she advised. They can send the sputum to a lab to determine what type of bacteria and other organisms are in it and how to treat it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bronchitis, bacterial bronchitis or bacterial pneumonia are the most common causes of a productive cough. But it could also be due to bronchiectasis (a disease where the airways of the lungs are dilated and aren’t able to clear out sputum as well), c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;hronic obstructive pulmonary disease &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(COPD) or lung cancer (although less common).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: damircudic via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;damircudic via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Timing, dryness and other symptoms can all help you determine what kind of cough you're dealing with, according to experts.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long have you had the cough? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Timing is really… [a] key thing to differentiate coughs,” Galiatsatos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; said. One of the first things your doctor will probably ask is, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tell me when this cough began.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Depending on how long a cough has been going on, it can be categorized as acute, subacute or chronic, Seo explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An acute cough is one that comes on suddenly and lasts for less than three weeks. It’s “usually caused by an acute upper or lower respiratory tract infection, allergies or irritant,” she said. But it also could occur if you have chronic conditions like asthma or COPD and your symptoms are exacerbated. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you have a dry cough with a viral illness and then about 10 days later develop a “heavy, productive” cough, this could be a sign of a bacterial infection, like bronchitis or pneumonia, Addrizzo-Harris said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The airways [can] become compromised [when you have] the flu [or other virus] and the regular bacteria that are living within the lung aren’t … cleared out as well,” she explained. “As they grow, the chance of getting a bacterial [infection is higher].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A subacute cough can last for three to eight weeks. While it can be an exacerbation of an underlying disease, it could also be a post-infectious cough lingering even after a respiratory infection is over, Seo said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The infection [may have] caused some lung damage and the lungs are repairing themselves,” Galiatsatos added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Lastly, a cough is generally considered chronic if it lasts for more than eight weeks and could indicate conditions like asthma, COPD, GERD or a more serious lung disease, like lung cancer, Seo said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have other symptoms with the cough? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to timing, any accompanying symptoms can be helpful clues for why you have a cough.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, if you have a cough with a stuffy or runny nose, sore throat or body aches, you could very well have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="viral infection" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d2d8dbe4b0180744f7a006" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12342-common-cold" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;viral infection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; like a cold, flu or COVID.

This could be a sign of bronchitis, asthma, allergies or other other health conditions, according to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/15203-wheezing" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cleveland Clinic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67d2d8dbe4b0180744f7a006" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/15203-wheezing" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What time of day are you coughing most frequently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s helpful to watch for any patterns of when you’re coughing the most, especially if it develops more gradually, Galiatsatos said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Does your cough come within hours of … going to bed and recently eating a meal? This would clue me in that it could be acid reflux,” he said. “Does your cough wake you up in the middle of the night, like hours into sleep? That tells me maybe that’s a little bit more asthma.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That said, the frequency (and severity) of a cough also really vary depending on the individual, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Seo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For example, the influenza virus may trigger a mild, short-lived cough in a healthy young person, but in an older individual with a weakened immune system … it can lead to a severe, potentially life-threatening cough and illness,” she explained.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So... what’s the best way to treat your cough? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The best management is really trying to understand why you have the cough,” Galiatsatos said. “Treating a cough with a cough suppressant without trying to figure out the underlying cause of it is like just taking pain meds without giving a second thought of why you’re having chest pain, for instance.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should see a doctor promptly if your cough is accompanied by fevers, chills, night sweats, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, chest pain or unintentional weight loss, Seo said.

Whenever I have period cramps, pelvic pain or a stabbing sensation in my thighs I get scared that I will have another ruptured cyst."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her diagnosis in 2023, Nina says everyday life has massively changed for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "Living with endometriosis has changed my life entirely, it's taken away my favourite hobbies such as volleyball and it has placed a huge strain on my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It effects my job and my productivity as there are days when I cannot leave my bed due to the pain. It really scares me that I could lose my job as each month I am absent due to the insufferable pain."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina says the biggest challenge she has faced since her diagnosis is how endometriosis has effected her fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "I felt like my life fell apart as I had always dreamt of becoming a mum but with endometriosis it is likely that I will struggle to conceive naturally, so the freedom of choosing when I would like to be a mum has been taken away from me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis Action Month is calling for greater awareness towards the chronic condition, Nina believes knowledge of endometriosis is getting better but it can come with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina said: "The diagnosis rate is getting better but it does mean more dedicated nurses within the NHS are needed to help women get the support they need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BloodyEndoMidlands is a charity supporting women suffering with endometriosis in the West Midlands region, you can visit their support group Facebook page and website online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="article-body-link" href="http://hellorayo.co.uk/hits-radio/play/" target="_blank"&gt;First for all the latest news from across the UK every hour on Hits Radio on DAB, at hitsradio.co.uk and on the Rayo app.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Rayo</author><pubDate>Wed, 19 Mar 2025 06:32:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-wFBVV95cUxPdzFkS0dPUVhWeHVnTmwyLUNQb0NXRjB1UXc1MEVaWFhFb2IyR1FoazRrbFNsSFlLNklFZmljV3oycldSRUhVX1o2RnRtdTZ3VnNkLXk3R0UwczVLMjhoWWdBbE1UNTRXeGZRd1hPNXVIcjlJWkdROC1rVTA1Yl9wYW45OGlfXzV5ck1JMU13Tk1vOFFVMng4UlZJNl9ydktnYzR5NGtBZkxRenFHYi01OV94VUN5bm4ycHAtbVdOSktEM2NGTlFiZ1J4NnBsT2dYbXNRYlBNQjNwQnA5SEowQmtmVGxkN1p0dFljS2xVUTEyWkUybDBTbXdmVQ</guid></item><item><title>Coach, athletic director recipient of UTMC's 1st pancreas transplant - Toledo Blade</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOWUkxbm5GYmF0dFEtY3Mtc3FQaXZVN3FhQWZmVTNVbUs3NmFmdmc3eG5UcDdfME92MDJKaFo0ajJPZDBORVV3WHBoNjVDdmJwTVpfWlhzRUtvZjI5VXJwMnFCSlJpZlZPWEdud1FzNXZBc2tpazA1VG5sRjI2TzFXWE1FNEZFYTU5R0lmYVdOMTRiRkoxY2lMRUg4ejg5YWFhYTVRS3BzU0I2STlpdV8xb3MxNHNJTGNhUHhN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body class="pgevoke bs-grid pg-hasicomoon pg-site-blade pg-requesttype-story pgevoke-pageparentsection-news pg-user-checkingstatus pg-useviafoura" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

This graph shows the latest year for which data is available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society estimates 154,270 Americans will be diagnosed with colon cancer this year, and 52,900 will die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease is also the second most common cause of cancer deaths around the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Cancer Research UK, 44,063 cases are diagnosed per year, and the nation experiences 16,808 deaths every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Studies show that in industrialized countries like the US and UK, early-onset colorectal cancer is increasing by two to four percent every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since the 1990s, cancer statistics have shown that EOCRC (early-onset colorectal cancer) has increased by more than 50 percent, meaning it is the leading cause of cancer death in men and the second-leading cause in women under 50. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colorectal cancer is most commonly found in the sigmoid colon, the lowest part of the colon just before the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A survey conducted by the Colorectal Cancer Alliance revealed that young patients with EOCRC often experience changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation, unexplained weight loss, fatigue and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The biggest red flag, however, is blood in the stool, on the toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If blood is bright red, it's 'newer' or came from lower in the digestive tract, such as in the sigmoid colon or rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if it's darker or black, it's 'older' and could have come from higher up in the colon or the stomach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the main reasons colorectal cancer is diagnosed so late or dismissed in young people is these signs could be attributed to more benign and common conditions like hemorrhoids or irritable bowel syndrome.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, roughly half of all Americans will have hemorrhoids at least once in their life, and one in 10 will be diagnosed with IBS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although bright red rectal bleeding is commonly associated with hemorrhoids, the rising incidence of EOCRC means that any concerning symptoms in younger individuals should not be dismissed without further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This blood loss can also cause anemia, leading to fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Why is there a surge of cases in young people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diets rich in red and processed meats, sedentary behavior, and obesity, are well-documented risk factors for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year a study from Cleveland Clinic's Center for Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer shed some light on why processed meats such as deli ham, hot dogs and burgers can be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;My &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13746823/oncologist-discovery-record-colon-cancer-patients.html"&gt;colleague Dr Suneel Kamath&lt;/a&gt; and his team collected plasma samples from 64 patients with colorectal cancer and found young patients had higher levels of compounds called metabolites from red and processed meat in their blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We think these metabolites help feed cancer cells and hijack normal cells, causing tumors to grow while healthy cells are deprived of the energy they need to function normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is also thought to be the case for alcohol.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for obesity, the latest science tells us that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14292265/body-fat-areas-higher-risk-colon-cancer-study.html"&gt;carrying more visceral fat around organs like the colon&lt;/a&gt; may create inflammation, which makes cancer cells more likely to form.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a significant proportion of young patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer do not fit this typical high-risk profile. Many are fit, have healthy diets, and do not exhibit common lifestyle risks like smoking or drinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This paradox points to the complexity of environmental exposures contributing to the disease, an active area of research that still comes with many unknowns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The concept of the 'exposome' - the total amount of environmental exposures that a person encounters during their lifetime - has emerged as a valuable framework for how genetic predisposition and the environment raise the risk of early-onset cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Teams like ours at the Cleveland Clinic are now trying to figure out which environmental factors contribute to the rise in colorectal cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some research has already provided theories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A review from the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14202563/colon-cancer-explosion-toxins-air-link.html"&gt;University of California San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; of more than 3,000 studies found that microplastics can accumulate in the colon and cause it to produce less mucus, a protective layer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the colon can't produce mucus, the intestinal walls can't protect against contaminants like microplastics and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mucus also lubricates the colon and helps stool pass easily. When stool builds up in the colon, it irritates the colon and inflames the inner lining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, much of this territory is still uncharted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;Am I at risk?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Besides environmental risk factors that still need to be identified, there are several known inherited conditions that predispose patients to colorectal cancer at a young age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, about 15 to 20 percent of early-onset colorectal cases cases are attributed to hereditary conditions - those passed on through families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of these are related to Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs when genes involved in DNA repair - mismatch repair genes - mutate. This significantly raises the risk of cells in organs like the colon growing out of control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimates one in 279 Americans has Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;FAP, meanwhile, causes the growth of numerous polyps that almost always lead to early-onset cancer if left untreated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For people with a family history of these conditions, genetic testing and early and frequent screening, including colonoscopies, are critical in identifying and preventing colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, risk-reducing surgeries, like removing parts or even all of the colon, may be the best prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A family history of colorectal cancer, especially when in a first-degree relative, even without a known hereditary condition, doubles your overall risk, so it's crucial to know your history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A known family history of colorectal cancer may prompt genetic testing and potentially life-saving screening colonoscopies, even if you're younger than 45, the current recommended screening age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer screened for and diagnosed?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer is crucial, as cancers detected in the early stages can often be cured with surgery alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unfortunately, early-onset colorectal cancer is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages because young people are more likely to ignore their symptoms or not be old enough for regular screenings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This complicates treatment and lowers survival rates. &lt;span&gt;When addressed early, the chances of successful treatment and cure are significantly higher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The good news in recent decades has been thanks to screening tools like colonoscopies and at-home stool tests, colon cancer rates are down in people over 65.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alarmingly these important gains were accompanied by a rise in cases and deaths in young people that are still below the age of recommended screening examinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing colorectal cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves inserting a long tube with a camera on the end into the anus and passing it through the rectum and colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the doctor finds polyps during the exam, they will remove them and test them for cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Cancer Society recommends getting a colonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45, though this guideline fails to capture the growing number of patients in their 20s and 30s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At-home stool tests like Cologuard have also become increasingly popular, allowing people to take a sample of their stool and send it off to check for hidden blood for DNA changes, which could be a sign of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, if you get a positive stool test, you will likely still be referred for a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;How is colon cancer treated?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treating young people with colon cancer requires special considerations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since hereditary conditions are more commonly found in young patients with cancer, any patient diagnosed with early-onset colon cancer should undergo genetic testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diagnosing genetic conditions like Lynch syndrome or FAP can have significant implications not only for the patient but for their relatives, as it could prevent further cancers in the family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Young patients with metastatic disease - meaning the cancer has spread to other areas - may benefit from aggressive treatment, including surgery to remove the primary tumor in the colon and also potential metastases in the liver or lung, but this must be balanced with a careful, individualized approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychological care is also an essential part of treatment, as cancer at a young age can have profound emotional and social impacts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can be very difficult for people who are used to being the primary caregivers in their families, taking care of young children and aging parents, to suddenly require care to be given to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Financial toxicity, which refers to the high costs associated with cancer treatment, is another challenge faced by many young patients who frequently do not have sufficient savings and are dependent on regular paychecks to make ends meet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social work support is crucial in addressing these financial burdens and helping patients navigate the complexities of cancer care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, since some cancer treatments can affect reproductive and sexual health, it is critical for EOCRC patients to discuss their plans for childbearing with their cancer provider and be referred to fertility specialists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike many patients traditionally diagnosed with colon cancer, these patients are focused on expanding their families, and we want to make sure they have every opportunity to do that.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The goal of my team is to optimize the quality of life for cancer survivors and provide ongoing support tailored to their unique needs. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox"&gt;What's the takeaway?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset colorectal cancer presents a significant public health challenge, driven by complex interactions between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preventing and reversing the rise of the disease in young people requires a deeper understanding of these influences and the implementation of personalized screening strategies, particularly for individuals with hereditary risks or a family history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early diagnosis is crucial to improving survival, and patients and healthcare providers need to be vigilant to prevent delays in detection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment must be tailored to the unique needs of younger patients through a multidisciplinary approach at expert centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As innovative research continues to shed light on the causes of colon cancer in young people, a more comprehensive patient- and population-centered approach will not only improve outcomes but also help reduce the overall impact of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It is getting dramatically worse by the day and baffled medical professionals at America's top hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His illness hasn't just affected his body; it has also impacted his mental clarity and decision-making, he and his wife told DailyMail.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dating back to June of last year, he began feeling extremely fatigued almost all the time and had begun developing serious acne on his back. By January, he'd developed the first major sore on his leg, which started out red but soon morphed into a terrifying black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of Wednesday last week, &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/news/article-14491549/new-skin-disease-ravages-father-doctors-warning-pyoderma-gangrenosum.html"&gt;40 to 50 percent of his skin was covered in sores&lt;/a&gt;. In just the last several days, he has developed five more wounds on his stomach, at the top of his right arm, and on the palms of his hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first wound in January coincided with a major personality shift, according to Mikkel Becker, his wife of one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At that time, he lost $25,000 of her retirement money by purchasing &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tesla/index.html" id="mol-864a33e0-0475-11f0-9899-c9616624572f"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; stock option contracts that went bust after 'Elon sent a tweet,' Ryan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Becker and his wife Mikkel are pictured with their kids at Disney World. Soon after this, he would get his first skin sore&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; Dermatologists believe Ryan, 38, has a never-before-seen form of pyoderma gangrenosum, a disorder that typically leaves sores only on the legs. He has developed sores on his arms, back, chest, stomach and even the on the palms of his hands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'January is when Ryan started to do dumb stuff he would never have done, like gambling my retirement [on a risky investment],' said Mikkel, who has a four-month-old baby named Atlas with Ryan. ‘Then that's the day that one of the first sores on his legs showed up.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dermatologists say their best guess is that Ryan, 38, has a never-before-seen form of pyoderma gangrenosum, a disorder that typically leaves sores only on the legs and is treatable with steroid therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But neither is true for Ryan. The sores have spread to nearly every corner of his body and doctors have not been able to find an effective form of treatment for him, even as he reports being in agony for large portions of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said his sores cause him 'burn victim level pain.' She added that nearly all the doctors they've seen have been shocked by his sheer number of ulcers and the severity of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Everywhere we go with Ryan, doctors are in shock, awe and horror. I mean, they can’t hide it on their faces. They're trained to not show any expression, but when they see Ryan, it's just like, “Oh my god,”’ Mikkel said, adding that they often go and get second, third and even fourth opinions from their colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He sought help at the Mayo Clinic in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-4e84a940-047f-11f0-9af9-f5bacadcdf9c"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and a Johns Hopkins-affiliated hospital in Washington, D.C., but still remains without answers he desperately seeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although his prognosis is still unknown — given that pyoderma gangrenosum remains poorly understood by scientists — Johns Hopkins gave Ryan the grim prediction in February that he likely has six months to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan said his latest test results have led the heartbroken family to believe that he's going to die 'a slow, painful death.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no cases that any of the dermatologists that I've talked to that have seen it spread to the legs, the torso and the arms,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan's sores first show up as red marks on his skin. They then get raised and blister before popping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After that, the sores become necrotic, meaning its essentially a mass of dead skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And with each new sore that appears, he goes through the same grueling process each time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So what happens is, they get red, they get raised, they blister, then they pop, then they go necrotic,’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When skin or any other tissue enters a 'necrotic' state, it essentially means that the cells have died due to a lack of blood flow. This is also when the skin turns dark black and almost looks like frost bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Necrosis can be extremely painful and &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection"&gt;presents with symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as a fever, sensations of 'crackling' under the skin, and brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan freely admits that in his case, it has gone far beyond brain fog or just normal confusion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though the first sores appeared in early January, it wasn't until early February when Mikkel realized it was time to go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I woke up to him having a seizure in the bed. And I'm trying to stop him from hitting his head on the bed. And his hands are flailing everywhere and he, you know, accidentally punches me in the face,’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At this time, he had also developed a chest wound 'in the shape of a heart,' Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan said he doesn’t remember that seizure at all, but Mikkel said he started having them during their family trip to Disney World from December 31 to January 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan Becker is pictured in a hotel room ahead of his visit to the Mayo Clinic with his wife Mikkel and four-month-old baby Atlas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once at the Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, the couple said Ryan was loaded up with a massive cocktail of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say he was given corticosteroids intravenously, a treatment typically given to deal with inflammation. Experts also say that high doses of these types of steroids can lead to psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was definitely in a state of acute psychosis,' Ryan said. ‘I was like, “I must have murdered someone or something” … I thought all the nurses were involved in it, that it was a sting operation, that I was gonna go to sleep, and they were gonna arrest me. But then also, my parents were into organized crime.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel and Ryan both said he believed Mikkel was an FBI agent and that his stepdaughter Reagan was a CIA agent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After that, Ryan said he agreed to be given Dilaudid, an opioid weaker than fentanyl but stronger than morphine, and Haldol, a powerful antipsychotic used to treat schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They kept me sleeping, at least I thought they did. Apparently, I sleep-walked,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over the last month, Ryan and Mikkel have been traveling around the country searching for a cure to his unusually aggressive disease. Their baby has been with them every step of the way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said that while she appreciated the doctors' efforts at the hospital in their home city, she fears their treatment was below what was needed given the severity of his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan and Mikkel thought their fortunes had turned around when the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota squeezed them in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to them, their arrival at the world-renowned health facility was the start of an entirely new nightmare when he wasn't taken seriously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple say doctors began making suggestions that weren't true, and it was briefly believed he was suffering from factitious disorder, better known as Munchausen syndrome, a condition where someone intentionally harms themselves to gain attention or affection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They completely stopped treating me,' he said, which he said included heavily reducing his course of painkillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A resident said, "So we believe you've been using substances... and you're causing these wounds yourself. So, we're going to go ahead and discharge you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm like, "How in the world do you think I'm causing these wounds by scratching myself?"' Ryan recalled saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mikkel said they had to jump through a lot of hoops to get the misunderstanding corrected, and their version of events was solidified when Ryan's urine test came back negative for drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan reports having extreme pain from the sores on his body as well as fatigue dating back to June of last year, before he even had any breakouts on his skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also said she had to repeatedly tell doctors that she was with her husband 24/7 and would know if his wounds were self-inflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When asked about Ryan's experiences, the Mayo Clinic declined to comment, citing patient privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After two weeks at the Mayo Clinic, the couple along with their baby got on another plane bound for Johns Hopkins Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors at the hospital, which partners with the National Institute of Health's Undiagnosed Diseases Program, did not believe Ryan had factitious disorder or had a drug problem, the couple said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That much was a comfort, they said, but their trip to Johns Hopkins yielded no more answers to why Ryan's case of pyoderma gangrenosum is so unusually aggressive — or why he is one of the few patients with the disease who could die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There's also no indication of what causes his sores to appear, though scientists who have studied the disease suspect it could be autoimmune-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The uncertainty that surrounds every aspect of Ryan's fast-progressing disease is what spurred them to travel across the country to the top medical institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That has also had the downside of taking Ryan and Mikkel out of the workforce, which will threaten their access to their employer-sponsored health plans in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To deal with Ryan's ongoing medical bills, the family has set up a GoFundMe that has raised more than $33,000 so far&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan works as a commercial plans examiner for Spokane County. He was originally under the impression that he'd have to return full-time by April 1, otherwise, he'd have to pay roughly $3,000 per month for COBRA coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His job has since worked out a deal with him that it will keep his family's benefits intact through August as long as they contribute to the health plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan doesn't have only himself to worry about. He has six children ranging from a four-month-old son to a 17-year-old daughter who need health coverage too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of possibly losing coverage, he recently received an unexpected medical bill from the Mayo Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It sent Ryan a letter stating that his stay was not covered by his health insurance and that he would be responsible for his remaining balance of $100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan is afraid that Johns Hopkins will do the same thing, though he hasn't received any denial of coverage correspondence from them yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far, the family has raised more than $33,000 on &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/RyanandKel"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Tuesday night, Ryan and Mikkel were on their way to Portland from their home in Spokane to see one of the world's foremost experts on pyoderma gangrenosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ryan and Mikkel are currently on their way to see Dr. Alex Ortega-Loayza (pictured) who is one of the world's foremost experts on pyoderma gangrenosum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Alex Ortega-Loayza is a dermatologist at the Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University Hospital, where he assembled a team of scientists, biostatisticians, and clinicians to specifically study pyoderma gangrenosum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ryan is scheduled to see Dr. Ortega this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, Ryan and Mikkel haven't lost their optimism or sense of humor, with the couple joking that he has 'zombie skin,' a fear he eerily predicted on his Bumble profile back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I think we met on Bumble, right? He had on there, what's your greatest fear?’ Mikkel explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And he said,’ Mikkel started before Ryan interjected, ‘to have a condition that causes a zombie apocalypse to be named after me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Now he's like, “Oh my God, my skin is like zombie skin now!”’ Mikkel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Beneficial microbes, primarily bacteria, help with digestion, synthesize certain micronutrients, and support your immune system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Microbes feed on what you eat, which is why your nutrition can play a crucial role in maintaining a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/how-to-heal-your-gut-8769420" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut&lt;/a&gt; microbiome.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming foods that nourish beneficial bacteria helps them grow and function. This also limits the food available for harmful bacteria, which helps to curb their growth.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fiber comes in two types: soluble and insoluble. The bacteria in your gut break down soluble fiber, producing beneficial compounds and gases. Insoluble fiber doesn't dissolve in water, but it helps soften stool and adds bulk, making it easier for food to move through your digestive system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming at least 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bacteria in your gut can break down prebiotics and make compounds called short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some foods, like yogurt, are fermented with live bacteria. Probiotics can also be added to unfermented foods such as juices, smoothies, milk, cereals, and formulas.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Probiotic foods may also help treat digestive concerns like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/condition/diarrhea-overview" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; or constipation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, not all fermented foods contain probiotics. Probiotics can be killed due to food processing, prolonged shelf life, and the acids and enzymes in your digestive system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Whether or not fermented foods contain live bacteria, they can still support your gut health because they contain compounds that bacteria produce while fermenting the food.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A study gave participants 100 grams of fermented vegetables daily, 100 grams of pickled vegetables daily, or none for six weeks.

			&lt;p&gt;When Catalonian &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Branyas"&gt;Maria Branyas&lt;/a&gt; died in August 2024 at the grand old age of 117 years and 168 days, she was officially the world's oldest living person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine how Maria managed to collect so many birthdays, a team led by researchers from the Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute in Spain conducted a comprehensive analysis on everything from her genes to her proteins to her microbiome to her metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their report, which is yet to be peer reviewed, provides a rare glimpse into the cellular machinery that just might give some of us a shot at starting a second centenary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155484" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg" alt="Maria at her 117th birthday" class="wp-image-155484 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-444x415.jpg 444w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/maria_117_642-600x561.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155484" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maria blowing out candles at her 117th birthday. (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Branyas#/media/File:Maria_Branyas_Morera_(117%C3%A8_aniversari).jpg"&gt;Family archive of Maria Branyas Morera/Wikimedia Commons/PD&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria was a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercentenarian"&gt;supercentenarian&lt;/a&gt; – someone who reaches the age of 110 or urpasses it – and it's quite an achievement. Only around 1 in 10 of the people who make it to a century of living then manage another decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a host of different analytical techniques and interviews, the researchers found that Maria checked a lot of the recommended boxes when it came to longevity and healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155398" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg" alt="Multiomics chart" class="wp-image-155398 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-416x415.jpg 416w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MultiomicsChart-600x598.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155398" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers looked at multiple signs of aging. (Santos-Pujol et al., &lt;em&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a mentally, socially, and physically active lifestyle, for instance, spending quality time with family and friends; all factors known to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-social-life-could-help-you-stave-off-dementia-for-years-study-finds"&gt;keep dementia at bay&lt;/a&gt;. Maria also ate well, sticking mostly to a Mediterranean-style diet that's been linked &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;to a longer lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing the researchers noted was Maria's love of yogurt. The researchers think the supercentenarian's diet choices helped to encourage healthy gut bacteria – and indeed her gut microbiome had the characteristics of someone much younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microorganisms are critical in determining not only the metabolite composition of our body, but also inflammation, intestinal permeability, cognition, and bone and muscle health," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variations in our DNA have long been considered critical in determining our mortality. Maria had genes associated with a stronger immune system, protection against heart disease, and a reduction in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-risk-of-cancer-could-fluctuate-even-born-youre-born"&gt;risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also looked at &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation"&gt;DNA methylation&lt;/a&gt;; a chemical marking mechanism that affects how genes are expressed. Since this mechanism is influenced by stresses in the environment, it is often used to gauge the passing of life's trials in what's described as our biological age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Remarkably, all the distinct algorithms of age based on DNA methylation yielded the same result," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our supercentenarian exhibited a much younger biological age than her real chronological age and this occurred in the three different tissues analyzed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other factors highlighted by the researchers were Maria's highly efficient metabolism, leading to lower levels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/experts-reveal-how-to-actually-lower-your-cholesterol"&gt;of 'bad' cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and higher levels of 'good' cholesterol, as well as low levels of inflammation (protecting against multiple health issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20250310/genetico-maria-branyas-117-anos-microbiota-nina/16484198.shtml"&gt;Maria herself&lt;/a&gt; put her long life down to an "orderly life and pleasant surroundings", but it's clear that there were multiple factors at work. While most of us won't reach 117, the research does help in understanding how the body can be given the best chance of aging without damage or disease – and from there improving our health in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The picture that emerges from our study shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level," &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but is available on the preprint server &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.24.639740v1"&gt;BioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;"For as long as I can remember, every time I pee, my eyes tear up. I don’t mean just a little watery-eyed moment, I mean full-blown tears streaming down my face, sometimes even a runny nose. The longer I hold it, the worse it gets. I always assumed this happened to everyone. Growing up without the internet, there wasn’t exactly a way to fact-check my experience, and honestly, it never even crossed my mind to ask my family about it. It was just…normal. Then, one fateful day in high school, I hadn’t adjusted to my new schedule yet, so I went for two full class periods without a bathroom break. By the time I finally made it to the restroom, the floodgates (both kinds) opened. When I walked back into class, my friends looked alarmed."&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“'Are you okay? Why were you crying?' one of them asked. Confused, I just shrugged. 'Oh, I wasn’t crying. I just really had to pee.' Apparently, this wasn’t a universal experience. No one in my friend group had any idea what I was talking about. In fact, they didn’t even believe me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today, and thanks to the internet, I now know this rare phenomenon is called Gustatory Lacrimation. It’s a quirky little glitch in the nervous system where the body gets its wires crossed, making my tear ducts go into overdrive when I relieve myself. If that’s not a completely useless superpower, I don’t know what is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;

It can be really difficult to place something your body has always done as being "wrong" when it's all you know!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/angelicaamartinez/unusual-body-experiences-add-yours" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:I asked BuzzFeed readers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;I asked BuzzFeed readers&lt;/a&gt; to share experiences like this that they've had, because we absolutely need to normalize talking about our bodies.

Sometimes, it sounds like jazz; other times, it’s old-timey swing or big band.

Basically, I can feel certain sounds in different parts of my body. For example, thunder feels like being kicked in the spine, and rustling paper or bags feels like someone running their fingers all over my back and chest. I love music because some songs feel like I'm being tickled or getting a massage. I was 33 when I discovered it wasn’t common to experience music and noises like this."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/megandonovan" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:megandonovan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;megandonovan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I wake up from anesthesia all the time. Every time. The first time I was under anesthesia, I was like 8 and getting stitches in my head. The doctor took a step back and was like, 'Oh gosh, you’re awake!' I felt him sewing my head back together and snip the stitches. It didn’t hurt, but it was itchy as crud. I also had jaw surgery when I was 13, and I woke up alone in a chair and dragged myself down the hallway until a nurse found me and helped me back to my room to sleep off the remainder of the anesthesia."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cornynugget234" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cornynugget234;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;cornynugget234&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;6.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I have experienced two very unusual brain-related conditions. First, when I was a child, I experienced something VERY STRANGE, and only within the last 10-15 years or so did I find it has a name for it: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fangelicaamartinez%2Funusual-body-things-2025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F24491-alice-in-wonderland-syndrome-aiws&amp;amp;xcust=7844528%7C0%7CRSS%7C0&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alice In Wonderland Syndrome;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Alice In Wonderland Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, I was experiencing things around me, and myself, growing and shrinking in size. It was more than visual — it was like I knew the sizes were changing. Sometimes it was accompanied by sounds. I didn't tell anyone about it until I was an adult, because I had no idea how to explain it."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Henrik Sorensen / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Then, starting at some point in early adulthood, I started experiencing something called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fangelicaamartinez%2Funusual-body-things-2025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.clevelandclinic.org%2Fhealth%2Fdiseases%2F21907-exploding-head-syndrome-ehs&amp;amp;xcust=7844528%7C0%7CRSS%7C0&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exploding Head Syndrome;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Exploding Head Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. (Why do both of these have the coolest-sounding names, btw?) When this happened, I would hear something like a loud explosion, which would wake me up. Upon asking others about it, there was no noise. Other times it manifests as hearing someone yelling my name, which wakes me up, too. But again, nobody is yelling anything, it's just my head."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hwh" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hwh;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;hwh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When I get turned on, I sneeze.

The sleep-drinking was the most problematic, because I've woken up drinking acetone, windex, and contact solution before. My brother did these, too, and my dad was notorious for eating a sleeve of Oreos while asleep. So, I thought it was normal. Over the last year, it's gotten WILD. One time, I made full-blown oven nachos with chopped vegetables. I fed them to my mom at 3 a.m. while dead asleep.

I have also seen it described as lacking a 'mind's eye.' Anyway, after hearing about it, I realized I have it. I had no idea. The fact that I can’t visualize images wasn’t something I had ever consciously thought about, but my mind is blown that when other people think about something they can vividly see it in their mind!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;15.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I can't hear anything while underwater, which I learned is apparently not normal.

I always assumed this happened to everyone. Growing up without the internet, there wasn’t exactly a way to fact-check my experience, and honestly, it never even crossed my mind to ask my family about it. It was just…normal. Then, one fateful day in high school, I hadn’t adjusted to my new schedule yet, so I went for two full class periods without a bathroom break. By the time I finally made it to the restroom, the floodgates (both kinds) opened. When I walked back into class, my friends looked alarmed."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“'Are you okay? Why were you crying?' one of them asked. Confused, I just shrugged. 'Oh, I wasn’t crying. I just really had to pee.' Apparently, this wasn’t a universal experience. No one in my friend group had any idea what I was talking about. In fact, they didn’t even believe me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fast forward to today, and thanks to the internet, I now know this rare phenomenon is called Gustatory Lacrimation.

I would always get frustrated because I was never sure if I was doing the exam correctly, but any attempts at clarifying the situation went nowhere. Fast forward a couple of decades, and I was listening to a podcast where the host was interviewing an optometrist about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fangelicaamartinez%2Funusual-body-things-2025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.optometrists.org%2Fgeneral-practice-optometry%2Fguide-to-binocular-visual-dysfunction%2Fwhat-is-vertical-heterophoria-signs-and-treatment%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DVertical%2520heterophoria%2520(VH)%2520is%2520a%2Cresulting%2520in%2520serious%2520vision%2520problems.&amp;amp;xcust=7844528%7C0%7CRSS%7C60038586&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vertical heterophoria;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;vertical heterophoria&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Joey Ingelhart / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"It was fascinating to hear that all these weird, random things I never thought twice about could be related and could be impacting my life negatively. I took an online quiz on that optometrist’s website, and she personally called me back a couple of days later. The weird dry feeling I get in large public spaces? Drifting into someone that I’m walking next to? Yep, didn’t realize people don’t normally do that. Aching eyeballs? Closing one eye to read? Neck pain because my head is always tilted? Every single one was a yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then, the doctor asked if I had double vision. I said no, just the normal kind that happens when I rest my eyes. She paused for a beat then told me double vision isn’t normal. I reassured her that it wasn’t actual double vision, just the normal double vision that everyone has when they unfocus and relax their eyes. That's when she diagnosed my vertical heterophoria, which is a type of binocular vision disorder where my eyes don’t align properly. I was prescribed prism glasses and was blown away when my headache, motion sickness, head tilt, neck pain, anxiety in open spaces, headaches, eye strain, and double vision went away immediately. Eye teaming issues are not screened for in standard vision exams, so binocular vision disorders are commonly missed. If I had not happened across that podcast, I doubt I would have ever realized there was an issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Jess, 44&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;28.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I thought all periods were just really bad. I thought it was normal to vomit and pass out purely from pain. Turns out it wasn’t, I have extreme hormone levels. I found out it wasn’t normal when after passing out for the third time in school. My school nurse told me he didn’t get periods, but even he knew this wasn’t normal. I’m currently on a treatment plan that involves birth control, and life is so much better. I had no idea how much of my life was needlessly painful, including times when I wasn’t even menstruating."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;29.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I learned that I have &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fangelicaamartinez%2Funusual-body-things-2025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Farticles%2FPMC9511037%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DBackground-%2CMusical%2520ear%2520syndrome%252C%2520also%2520known%2520as%2520musical%2520hallucinations%2520(MH)%2Cstimuli%2520%255B1%252C2%255D.&amp;amp;xcust=7844528%7C0%7CRSS%7C60038581&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Musical Ear Syndrome;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;Musical Ear Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; by reading the comments from one of these BuzzFeed articles. When it’s quiet but there is white noise, like a fan running, I’ll hear very faint music or talk as if a radio were on in another room of the house."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Jessica, 44&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;30.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I have a 'pocket' in my throat! I can partially swallow food I’m not done chewing and then regurgitate it back into my mouth whenever I want. While I have something stashed in my throat pocket, my mouth is completely empty, and I can breathe and talk just fine. I can only stash solids (liquids are a no-go), and if I wait too long to put the food back in my mouth, I’ll reflexively swallow it the rest of the way. It may seem a bit gross, but it’s actually really convenient — being able to do this has saved me from choking and/or embarrassing myself with a spit-take on so many occasions!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Jan-Otto / Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Lindsey, 30&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;31.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Only my right arm has seizures. Yup. As a kid, I could at first extend my arm, and just kind of let it shake, and my wrist would go back and forth and clench. It was a cool party trick. When I was older, I was having a physical, and my doctor asked if I had any questions. I thought since I was getting older and body changes were occurring (like leaking when laughing type thing), I should show him my arm thing. Of course, it stopped on its own, and my doctor sent me for a bunch of tests. I found out I have a form of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74679X1524629&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buzzfeed.com%2Fangelicaamartinez%2Funusual-body-things-2025&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yalemedicine.org%2Fconditions%2Fneuropathy&amp;amp;xcust=7844528%7C0%7CRSS%7C60038585&amp;amp;xs=1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuropathy;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;neuropathy&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;32.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"I can’t smell ammonia. I didn’t realize it had a smell at all until I got married and started living with my husband. We were talking about the products we needed to buy to clean our first place. He said he preferred bleach-based products because he hated the smell less than ammonia-based products. I was confused, to say the least! We immediately went to buy some ammonia for a little scientific test. Sure enough, no smell! I can ~feel~ the burn in my nostrils (always waft, folks!) but absolutely no smell."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;33.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;"When I got pregnant and had my first doctor’s visit, they examined me from top to bottom. The doctor asked me to lift my gown to see my breasts. She then exclaimed, 'Oh, look at that. You have a third nipple!' Then, she reached down and wiggled it with her finger while saying, 'Boodoodoodoodoo!' I was so shocked that I didn’t think to be offended. I always thought I had a weird-shaped mole. I was 22 years old when I learned it was an extra nipple."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; Gareth Cattermole / Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;—Anonymous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span&gt;34.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;And lastly, "Often after using mouthwash, the inside of my mouth peels. I’m in my 40s and never thought a thing about it. One day, I was talking to my dentist, and she offhandedly mentioned how some people have an allergic reaction that will make their mouth slough skin.
