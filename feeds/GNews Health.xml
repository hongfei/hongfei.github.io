health officials announced last week that pertussis - perhaps better known as whooping cough - is on the rise in the popular tourist hotspot at a 'worrying rate,' &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/hi/hawaii/news/2025/05/22/whooping-cough-cases-increase-in-hawaii"&gt;according to Spectrum Local News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of May 15, the state had already recorded 108 cases this year - surpassing last year's total cases of 84, the State of Hawaii Department of Health reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It called whooping cough a 'highly contagious respiratory disease' that spreads from bacteria through the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At first, the symptoms can resemble a cold - but they can quickly progress to 'intense coughing fits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In children, those fits could be followed by a 'deep breath' that makes a 'whooping sound' due to clogged airways that are not fully formed,&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/american-honeymoon-hotspot-hit-highly-contagious-illness-health-officials-warn"&gt; Fox News reports. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Complications from the disease 'can be serious and even life-threatening, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated,' health officials warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those complications can include pneumonia, seizures, apnea, encephalopathy (a disease of the brain) - and even possibly death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pertussis - perhaps better known as whooping cough - is on the rise in one American state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;As of May 15, Hawaii  had already recorded 108 cases this year  - surpassing last year's total cases of 84&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'Pertussis is insidious and can be easily mistaken for other respiratory diseases - including viruses,' Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel warned. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that whooping cough - which is a bacterial infection - can be treated with routine antibiotics but it is 'easily missed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best protection is vaccination, including repeated boosters in teens and adults,' Siegel suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The DTaP (diptheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine is administered to children under the age of seven, while the Tdap (tetanus, diptheria and pertussis) vaccine is available for older children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neha Pathak, WebMD chief physician editor, told Fox News that about 98 out of 100 children who get the DTaP vaccine are protected from the diseases for at least one year after a fifth dose and about 70 percent are still protected up to five years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also said she suggests pregnant woman get the Tdap jab during their third trimester to pass antibodies onto their newborns who are too young to get the DTaP vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Hawaii health officials called whooping cough a 'highly contagious respiratory disease' that spreads from bacteria through the air&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Siegel further claimed that DTaP is 'highly effective' in children with nearly 100 percent protection with appropriate dosages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, multiple doses are also generally recommended for infants, children and adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in Hawaii, health officials say vaccination rates 'for all routinely-recommended vaccinations for school entry - including those for measles, pertussis, polio and varicella (chicken pox)' have declined since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its vaccination levels are now even below the national average, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/05/22/whooping-cough-cases-surge-hawaii/"&gt;according to Hawaii News Now. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The uptick in pertussis cases is concerning, but not surprising given what we are seeing with vaccine hesitancy,' Pathak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors say the best way to prevent pertussis is by getting routine vaccinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, the rise in pertussis cases in Hawaii comes as experts warn &lt;span&gt;America is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7109605/US-measles-caseload-surpasses-1-000-health-officials-announce.html"&gt;poised for a measles explosion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; if vaccine rates continue to fall at their current pace. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research from Stanford University estimates that just a five percent decline in coverage with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) would lead to an estimated 5.7 million measles cases and at least 2,500 deaths over the next 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's the equivalent of 228,000 cases and 320 deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in a devastating scenario, a 50 percent decline in vaccinations could flood the country with &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691635/Americas-measles-outbreak-reaches-terrifying-milestone-96-infected-common.html"&gt;the life-threatening disease&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to 51 million cases, including 10.3 million hospitalizations and between 151,200 and 164,700 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For context, the US has confirmed 5,567 measles cases over the past 25 years, averaging 223 per year. In 2019 alone, there were nearly 1,300 cases; in 2020, just 13. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If rates stay where they are, the US could &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-7403205/There-reasonable-chance-lose-measles-elimination-status.html"&gt;lose its measles elimination status within two decades.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Stanford research projects that if vaccinations dip by just five percent, the case count of measles could jump to 5.7 million with 2,550 deaths over the next 25 years. In the worst-case scenario, if vaccination coverage were to plummet by 50 percent, cases could exceed 51 million with between 150,000 and 164,000 deaths&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;The US&lt;span&gt; is facing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, centered in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/coverage"&gt;Gaines and Lubbock counties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, West Texas, where just 74 percent and 92 percent of children are vaccinated, respectively. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas has confirmed 728 measles cases so far, with over 400 in Gaines County alone. Two children in Texas and one in New Mexico have died. New Mexico has reported 71 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hawaii also confirmed two cases in April, but health officials since concluded there was no further spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, health officials in the Aloha State warn they are not out of the woods on that yet, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Measles cases in the United States continue to rise, with more than 1,000 cases already reported across 30 states this year,' they said in the news release last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The risk remains high for future travel-related measles cases reaching Hawaii and DOH recommends continued vigilance efforts to increase the MMR vaccination rate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It then stressed its 'strong' recommendation for children and adults to stay up-to-date on all vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 05:37:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxPSU5oUVBRRUhtUG9DdXJ2VTE1dVRfRUc1OWo5V2xlcHZFanZzTmI4UGNYeWRuaU0wSEdCQVNqMHRCZk4tT0dLeGt0SmlER0x2MU5QUUNJUHl3SUdMTVJ4b0VsTm1jZVVaUEtqbmVJM2d1UXE3cWpBcTdoVm16Umc2VkpzODk4MEZqc2hfYmZpaTM2MWVLcVN3LW5ZSzRlS24taV930gGoAUFVX3lxTE5KTFdnWTI1QWhrVUViRE5UdFplUEpGcUZ2R0FGU3pkU2JUZG9QY3R1S3FWVkdFY1Y0RlB1MDlFdmw4bUFSMnZldmdLVlZpYktGaU5rQWtxZnZoSjN5Q1dqTTZsb0kzM3pzbkpmcTFzTzdjanc3cWQxa1BLZmhKQWc5SjJXRkJuOWVIOXVPUlUtaUxYTnh5TTNkN2liNlpnTjFDR1JXN2xlVQ</guid></item><item><title>我归咎于压力的早期预警迹象，实际上是我40多岁的早发性阿尔茨海默氏症-每日邮报 | Early warning signs I blamed on stress that were actually early-onset Alzheimer's in my forties - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxOa25lUVNRTUdrRUlOU2tBMFkydlJOdFFFbEwxem44ZXBOZi12cndFeUI2Tl9sT2FGQUhQWXlock5JTnF0Zm5FZDB6cW9vTjhna20zSFVpNUlkeTdHWnBITjZ2TzVyLW1HaEFERzc5US1tRmVteUZZaDBqYWhra0NoUjU4MUJ1ZTY3QVlFSjk0R0x4eW1Db2JaTTV3SXNqeG1rQWE1aTBtdlVSa3Z2dUQ5blgxMmNHekJ1TzlXem5PRERRTTNOVWJxNFVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rebecca Luna says she can't remember the previous day ‘seven to eight times out of 10.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She occasionally blacks out in the middle of conversations with friends: 'It's almost like I'm not there, it's black, and it feels blank. It's a complete nothingness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she comes to, she doesn't know what she's just said or done. The mother-of -two has also forgotten to turn the stove off and unknowingly started her car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These lapses are all part of Luna's rare diagnosis: &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14485077/man-alzheimers-symptom-subtle-disease-early-onset.html"&gt;early-onset Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her symptoms began two years ago, and she started seeing psychiatrists for her memory ‘blips’, which Luna first chalked up to perimenopause or her &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/adhd/index.html" id="mol-d8efc380-3b11-11f0-9bce-2b2fdcade45d"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;. Luna also suffered from alcoholism for years - she is now 15 years sober - and feared her lapses could be repercussions of her addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn’t until a neurologist administered a two-hour cognitive test, which she failed, and took detailed MRI scans, that she learned the truth nine months ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Canadian native has grappled with the knowledge that the neurodegenerative disease will rob her of time with her children and has had to explain to them that, given her diagnosis, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;the mother they know her as will likely begin to disappear&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer's is more progressive, with a shorter life expectancy of about eight years from diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rebecca Luna's early-onset Alzheimer's symptoms appeared about two years ago. She would black out mid-conversation, lose her keys only to find them in her car's ignition, forget what she did the day before, and left to stove on at home for an hour before returning to find her kitchen full of smoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wheredidrebeccago/video/7492897462038842629"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: ‘It’s really hard to think about that stuff because I am in denial. So when my brain is like, let’s look at the facts, sometimes I look at my neurology documentation with all the scientific facts – they’re not just out of nowhere, they’re not perimenopause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I have to look at that stuff to make it real for myself because I just love gaslighting myself… It is a progressive illness. We’re catching it super early, which is amazing, but there is no cure.’  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna had noticed a growing number of troubling instances over around two years in which she couldn’t remember doing basic, everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One day, she returned to her car in the gym parking lot and realized she couldn’t find her keys. She checked around and underneath the car and even looked on the roof, thinking she had left them there like she'd done in the past with her coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, she realized: the car was running, and the keys were in the ignition. She had already gotten in the car and turned it on but it didn't register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My car was on that whole time. I had completely blanked out the process of getting in, putting the key in, and turning the ignition on,’ she told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/i-have-early-onset-alzheimers-im-48-100001051.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIKzB4JHK31GEmdl2AXQxqYvK341rLNj2mOtC4uHs-KMPi5YsaLoJUJLgFmaDiGyC44CxjrDxvt1pOCIwvvIqh3VKza90FqXZu3YXMPToGoAksbqW_eFQHbNKu72aGah9E2MoBl6-1BlaH_cRDNjDKvzCI__Od9fgY-C7uJLa32J"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another time, she began boiling an egg on the stove, forgot about it, and left home for about half hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she eventually realized what she had done, she ran home to find her kitchen filled with smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using Framingham Heart Study data through 2009, researchers estimated that at age 45, the lifetime risk of Alzheimer’s dementia was about 20 percent for women and 10 percnet for men, with slightly higher risks at age 65&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So, it literally almost caught my house on fire,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna's psychiatrist administered several cognitive tests, which ask people to recall words, name objects, follow simple instructions, or draw shapes. Doctors also check for memory, language, and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She failed all of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nine months ago, when she went to a neurologist for specialized care to confirm what the tests had found, she underwent a more expansive series of tests assessing her memory, attention, language, reasoning, visual-spatial skills, and emotional health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each test in the neurological evaluation has its own scoring system based on what is normal for a person's age beyond just looking at whether the patient scored high or low on a test. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end, the doctor reviews all of the individual test scores to spot certain patterns, such as an usually low memory score with normal attention and language skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps the doctor spot signs their patient is dealing with Alzheimer's specifically, the type of dementia whose first symptom is memory problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna said: ‘Then he looked at my MRIs, looked at other things noted by the psychiatrist, and he just walked in with pamphlets of early-onset Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There was no diagnosis at that time. This was his suspicion.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further testing, including her medial temporal atrophy (MTA) score, which is a diagnostic tool for dementia, led to a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s affects a small subset of the population diagnosed with this memory-robbing form of dementia caused by shrinking brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6538053/"&gt;five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the nearly 7million Americans with the disease are diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 65, well before the average diagnosis age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-onset Alzheimer’s is not typical Alzheimer’s disease at a younger age. It &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13538685/major-study-dementia-risk-mother-earlier-father.html"&gt;often runs in families&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, it’s passed down directly from parent to child, while in others, people may inherit a mix of genes that increase their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The disease tends to progress faster in people with an early-onset diagnosis compared to those who develop it later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even after accounting for the general risks of aging, people with early-onset Alzheimer's have a higher risk of dying compared to those with late-onset or typical Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes a significant number of premature deaths in adults aged 40 to 64 caused by complications due to Alzheimer's, like infections, seizures, and pneumonia caused by food or liquid enters the lungs instead of the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The wide variety of causes of death means quantifying the annual death toll linked to the condition is difficult to pin down. Still, about 120,000 people with Alzheimer's, both typical and early-onset, died in 2022 (the most recent year for which data is available). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In addition to administering lengthy cognitive tests, Luna's doctor took scans of her brain to document the shrinkage that had occured until then. This is not Luna's scan, but demonstrates what brain atrophy looks like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While early-onset Alzheimer's if often hereditary, Luna did not say whether she has a family history of the condition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, people with early-onset Alzheimer's often go about 1.6 years longer before getting diagnosed than those with late-onset Alzheimer's, likely because symptoms are missed or doctors take more time to evaluate younger patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Following her diagnosis, Luna's family, including her daughter and mother, is in denial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘About two months ago, I sent her [my mother] the [doctor’s] clinical notes where he's put Alzheimer's on it. And she lost it then because I think she wasn't believing it until she saw it on a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s so weird. I make fun of it all the time because that's just generally who I am. I like to keep things kind of light and funny. It's important for me to make fun of myself, to keep the morale high for the people around me, but I also need it because it is so serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I could totally take this and just go on an isolation/depression bender, and I do not want to do that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Luna began a TikTok account where she updates her 29,000 followers about her symptoms, her daily life, and her tips for self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association projects that the number of Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer's dementia will rise sharply from 6.7 million in 2023 to 12.7 million by 2050, driven largely by the aging baby boomer generation, who face a higher risk of the disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has found a community on the site and many helpful tips from people in the comments section enduring similar diagnoses or helping a loved one cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some of the best she has heard and implemented is minimizing clutter in her home, making playlists of songs that bring her back to herself, and journaling during the day, ‘because what's one of my new things is I shower and then two hours later I feel like I need to have a shower.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: ‘If you are a loved one [of someone with Alzheimer’s], my suggestion is to meet them where they're at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘What I've found really helpful with my partner is not to be questioned but reminded, and to just believe them.

But the movement in the Senate suggests an increasingly hawkish mood on Capitol Hill and a growing frustration with Russia’s intransigence among Republicans, who are ramping up their calls for decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of Mr. Trump’s, is leading the bipartisan push on the Russia sanctions bill, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. Last week, speaking from the Senate floor, Mr. Graham appeared to be aiming his remarks directly at the president in a bid to persuade him that any influence he may imagine he has over President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia does not appear to be having much impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Putin, in my view, is playing us all,” Mr. Graham warned. He laid out missed opportunities for diplomacy that he said proved Russia was not serious about peace. “President Trump called for a 30-day cease-fire. Ukraine said yes; Russia said no,” he said. “President Trump urged Zelensky and Putin to go to Istanbul — I was over there — and meet to have direct talks. Zelensky went; Putin didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“We’ve given Russia plenty of opportunity to find an honorable and just end to this war,” Mr. Graham continued. “They’re not interested. And they’re not going to change until we up the ante. So we need moral clarity here. Putin is dragging this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Trump has in recent days hinted at a change in posture. After Russia’s latest assault, he told reporters that he was “not happy” with Mr. Putin and was “considering more sanctions.” In a social media post on Tuesday, Mr. Trump accused the Russian president of “playing with fire,” saying that if it were not for Mr. Trump, “lots of really bad things would have already happened in Russia.” That prompted a bellicose response from one Russian official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“I only know of one REALLY BAD thing — WWIII,” Dmitri Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Kremlin’s security council, wrote in a social media post. “I hope Trump understands this!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;But it was not clear whether Mr. Trump’s heated rhetoric indicated any change in his broader view that it is time for the United States to wash its hands of involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has signaled a desire to move beyond the war, musing about a potential economic partnership with Russia after a peace deal. A White House adviser recently &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html" title=""&gt;told The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that additional sanctions could hinder business opportunities, adding that the president instead wants to focus on maximizing economic opportunities with the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;The White House did not reply on Tuesday to requests for an update on Mr. Trump’s stance on sanctions against Russia, and did not say whether he backed the Senate measure or was willing to send more aid or weapons to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In response to questions about Mr. Graham’s bill, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in a statement: “The Russia-Ukraine war is Joe Biden’s fault, and President Trump has been clear he wants to see a negotiated peace deal. President Trump has also smartly kept all options on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;So far, though, Mr. Trump’s desire to look past the current state of the war stands in stark contrast to the views of many Republicans in Congress, who maintain their party’s longstanding view of Russia as a bitter adversary that deserves to be treated as such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In a social media post on Monday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa declared that he had seen enough of Mr. Putin killing innocent civilians and publicly urged Mr. Trump to “take action,” urging him to consider “AT LEAST SANCTIONS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;On Tuesday, Mr. Grassley wrote on social media that he thought Mr. Trump had been sincere in thinking his friendship with Mr. Putin would bring an end to the war, but that “ITS TIME FOR SANCTIONS STRONG ENUF SO PUTIN KNOWS ‘game over.’” And he suggested that Mr. Trump should be at least as harsh in trying to cut off Mr. Putin from the world financial system as he has been in seeking to cut off Harvard University from federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Sanctions for Putin like no fed grants for Harvard,” he wrote in his post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Even before the latest assault, other Republicans had called for a tougher stance against Mr. Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“Obviously, he’s not been serious about the negotiations,” Senator John Cornyn of Texas said last week when discussing the Russian president’s reluctance to engage in peace talks. Mr. Cornyn praised Mr. Trump’s efforts to bring both countries to the table for negotiations, but said the Russian president would first “have to get serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Both senators, like many Republicans on Capitol Hill, have tried to maintain deference to Mr. Trump’s leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;In an opinion essay published in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday morning, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-u-s-senate-wont-tolerate-putins-games-vladimir-russia-war-ukraine-sanctions-16780c2f" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Graham wrote&lt;/a&gt;: “President Trump has asked Vladimir Putin to provide a term sheet outlining the requirements for a cease-fire, bringing the roadblocks to peace to a head. Depending on how Russia responds, we will know which course to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;But some in the party believe Russia’s weekend assault was the response — just not the one they were hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“I think we need to put the hurt on Putin,” Senator Todd Young of Indiana said bluntly when asked about the sanctions package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;Some proponents of ratcheting up the pressure on Mr. Putin regard Mr. Graham’s moves as complementing Mr. Trump’s strategy, not running counter to it. With a supermajority in the Senate backing sanctions, the president may have a stronger hand to play the good cop as Congress positions itself as the bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“You have to believe Lindsey Graham is in close touch with the White House on this and he wouldn’t be moving forward without tacit approval,” said William B. Taylor Jr., who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;So far, however, Mr. Trump has not followed through on his occasional threats against Mr. Putin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="live-blog-post-content css-h61jh5 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is not the first time he’s expressed frustration, irritation, he’s pissed off, Putin’s crazy — all those things — and threats to impose sanctions without actually following through,” Mr. Taylor said. “The threats to do that, unless followed up by action, indicate that he’s not resolved to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 03:11:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiY0FVX3lxTFBhNGlTRmZ0TjdhX2pvTy1UNlNTQTBjU0wtM0MxeUF6bEFtVTNNYkd1eVJjbDhubUpfbHgxakZhYTBJTlBqVXBZcnpLQmVrTzU1ZTVnLUVXZjhqWC0yM1FBelVMUQ</guid></item><item><title>医生对数百万人服用的抗炎药物发出警报，使您容易受到致命的病毒感染-每日邮报 | Doctors sound alarm over anti-inflammatory drugs taken by millions that leave you open to deadly viral infecti - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drugs were designed to banish discomfort and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a new study has revealed that a class of common anti-inflammatory drugs may actually make people sicker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) discovered that a class of medications called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors can make the body vulnerable to viral infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medications work by blocking immune system proteins in the body that often lead to inflammation and pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are used to treat of a variety medical conditions suffered by millions globally,&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14656849/cancer-arthritis-drug-companies-selling-treatments-cost-NHS.html"&gt; including rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, eczema, alopecia, and certain bone cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They are relatively new drugs, and the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12080087/Patients-blood-cancer-spared-chemotherapy-two-daily-tablets.html"&gt;first JAK inhibitor, sold under the brand name Jakafi&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-dcfc1570-3b3c-11f0-be2d-01d8cd5a318d"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; treatment, was only just approved by the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-e7207500-3b28-11f0-8fa7-0551221d0108"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there is now evidence suggesting these drugs - which are typically taken as pills - could help the flu, Covid-19 and other viruses infiltrate the body's immune system, potentially leading to severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists say this is because the drugs 'suppress an important immune signaling pathway that helps protect healthy cells from viral attacks.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drugs are supposed to help banish discomfort and disease, but a new study has revealed that a class of anti-inflammatory drugs can actually make people sicker (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found drugs in the class, such as baricitinib, which is sold under the brand name Olumiant for the treatment of alopecia - slow down the genes that respond to viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These genes play a crucial role in the body's response to viral infections,' said Aleksandr Ianevski, an NTNU researcher and co-author of the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By stopping or slowing down this pathway, JAK inhibitors remove the body's 'antiviral shield'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This allows viruses to more easily gain a foothold in the body and spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used advanced techniques in a lab to look at how JAK inhibitors impact organs and how viruses attack the body once they have been exposed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They examined cells from the lungs, eyes and brain, as well as laboratory-created mini-organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Off the back of their findings Erlend Ravlo, a PhD research fellow at NTNU, said: 'Although JAK inhibitors are effective in the treatment of inflammation, this shows that they can pose a hidden risk for patients who have latent or active viral infections.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggest healthcare professionals should be cautious when prescribing JAK inhibitors, especially during viral outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Common side effects of the medications include headaches, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, acne, and elevated cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, rarer but more serious side effects include severe infections like pneumonia or shingles, damage to the stomach or intestines, and changes in blood cell counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Sarah Erickson, who specializes in treating hair loss, sounds the alarm about JAK inhibitors in one of her TikToks where she notes some of the 'harsh' side effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;They are relatively new drugs, and the first JAK inhibitor, sold under the brand name Jakafi for cancer treatment, was only just approved by the FDA in 2011 (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the immunosuppressive effects of the drugs could be harmful, the researchers point out that it could be useful in controlled environments, such as in the development of vaccines or screening of antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We recommend further studies to better understand how the drugs can be used optimally, especially during virus outbreaks or pandemics,' says Ianevski. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers hope to increase awareness among doctors and researchers about the effects of these drugs to prevent patients from developing new illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is especially important for vulnerable patients, such as the elderly or individuals with chronic illnesses or disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings were published in the medical journal, NAR Molecular Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 02:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>肠癌在年轻人中迅速上升：沉默杀手的原因和症状-印度时报 | Bowel cancer is rising rapidly in younger people: Causes and symptoms of the silent killer - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer in young people is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, Scientists have found that a bacterial toxin called colibactin may be causing the rise in bowel cancer among young adults. As per them, being exposed to this toxin in childhood could increase the risk of developing cancer later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although researchers are not certain how this exposure occurs, they know that colibactin is produced by certain strains of Escherichia coli bacteria in the gut. They suggest that damaging exposure likely happens within the first 10 years of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is bowel cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer, also known as colorectal cancer, is a type of cancer that develops in the colon or rectum. It can be caused by the abnormal growth of cells in the lining of the colon or rectum, often starting as small polyps. Symptoms can include blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain, and weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is colibactin linked to bowel cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin has been linked to bowel cancer before, but researchers had not specifically studied its effects on people under 50 until now. This link may help explain why bowel cancer is expected to be the leading cancer-related cause of death for young adults in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is that childhood infections produce colibactin, which then harms DNA in the bowel. These mutations can increase the chance of developing cancer later on, often many years after the colibactin is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colibactin-related DNA mutations were found to be 3.3 times more common in adults diagnosed with cancer before age 40 compared to those diagnosed at 70 or older. In older patients, the DNA patterns were more often linked to normal aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26656679" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="causes-of-bowel-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Causes of bowel cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer is a complex disease with multiple potential causes and risk factors, including age, family history, diet, lifestyle, and certain medical conditions.

However, younger adults of the age group 25-49 are getting more susceptible to the disease with the passing days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Family history:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A family history of bowel cancer or certain inherited conditions like Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) can increase the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Diet:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; A diet low in fiber and high in fat can increase the risk of bowel cancer.

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;announced the change&lt;/a&gt; on X on Tuesday, citing a lack of data to support shots for healthy children. The move echoes his longstanding skepticism about the need to vaccinate children against the virus. Mr. Kennedy, who as health secretary oversees the C.D.C., has repeatedly said that children are at almost no risk from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s true that for many children, a case of Covid will be inconsequential. They might have a runny nose, a cough or other mild symptoms, if any at all, and bounce back within a few days. But some children do become seriously ill and, in rare cases, die from their infections. And data shows that over one million U.S. children have developed long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That discrepancy is at the root of a continuing debate among medical researchers about just how much of a risk Covid poses to children, and whether they should receive annual vaccines against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Many agree that the original course of vaccination offered significant protection against serious illness in children. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/72/wr/mm7248a2.htm" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Data from the C.D.C.&lt;/a&gt; shows that two or more doses of Covid vaccines were 40 percent effective at preventing emergency room visits and hospitalizations among children under the age of 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the question of whether children need annual vaccines to protect against the latest circulating variants is more contentious. Children might not benefit as much as adults would from a yearly shot because their immune systems can remember vaccinations for much longer, said Dr. Michael Mina, a former professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has extensively studied Covid. Another argument against annual shots is that most children in the United States now have some degree of protection from previous infections or vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The star ingredient of this calming beverage—and the reason behind its golden hue—is &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561449/health-benefits-of-turmeric-ginger/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;. Known for its vibrant color, turmeric is a root that’s typically enjoyed in powdered form, and it’s brimming with anti-inflammatory compounds that may support gut health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies suggest that curcumin—the main active compound in turmeric—can help reduce inflammation of the gut lining and, as a result, may help protect against autoimmune diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While more research is needed, studies suggest that ginger may help promote gastric emptying, improve gut motility and minimize &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7921623/the-fastest-way-to-relieve-an-upset-stomach-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;indigestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It’s thought that these benefits are due to active compounds found in ginger, including gingerols and shogaols, which may help stimulate the production of digestive enzymes and promote gastrointestinal contractions to keep things moving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Help You Poop &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated is key for making bathroom visits a smoother experience—literally. Drinking enough fluid can help make stool easier to pass and reduce the risk of constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While we typically think of water when it comes to hydration, milk and plant-based milk alternatives also count toward your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7825445/how-much-water-should-you-drink-by-the-numbers/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily fluid goal&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some people suggest that turmeric may have a gentle laxative effect and be helpful for reducing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), including constipation. However, research is limited, with larger studies needed to confirm this effect.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-include-golden-milk-in-a-nightly-routine"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Include Golden Milk in a Nightly Routine &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sipping on a warm mug of golden milk can be a nutritious addition to your bedtime routine, helping you wind down after a long day—and if you don’t have a bedtime routine yet, it may be a good time to start. Research shows that maintaining a regular sleep-hygiene routine can improve sleep quality, which in turn can support numerous other aspects of health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hochreiter agrees: “Pairing your drink with a relaxing bedtime ritual helps to transform this nourishing drink into an act of self-care. When sipped slowly, this warm and soothing drink can help to shift your body into a parasympathetic ‘rest and digest’ state, promoting restful sleep and optimal overnight gut healing.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Start by getting into comfortable, breathable clothes, putting your phone away and stepping into your kitchen. Add coconut milk (or other plant-based or cow’s milk), turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper and sweetener of choice to a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. Pour the milk into a mug and find a cozy, quiet spot in your home to sip slowly while reading or doing a guided meditation. Wrap up your routine by putting your mug in the sink, and don’t forget to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8054788/oral-hygiene-improve-gut-health-research/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;brush your teeth&lt;/a&gt;—after all, your dental hygiene can have a big impact on your gut health, too!

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-look-for-in-a-drink-for-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Look For in a Drink for Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to gut health, there’s no one “best” drink that’s helpful for everyone. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is why Hochreiter recommends being wary of trendy beverages that make too-good-to-be-true claims about their benefits on gut health. Instead, she recommends sticking to these general guidelines and selecting a drink that works for your needs:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Added Sugars, Artificial Sweeteners and Gums: &lt;/strong&gt;When possible, opt for drinks with minimal or no added sugars or artificial additives, as they may &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7871982/worst-food-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;disrupt the microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and trigger symptoms, like bloating, in some folks. Instead, choose drinks that are naturally sweetened and contain easily recognizable ingredients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Caffeine-Free Options: &lt;/strong&gt;Caffeine-free beverages, like water, milk and herbal teas, tend to be gentler on digestion and less likely to disrupt your sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for Prebiotics or Probiotics: &lt;/strong&gt;While they aren’t the right fit for everyone, drinks containing prebiotics or probiotics may be beneficial for some. For example, kefir is a nutritious option that provides probiotics, as well as protein and potassium. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rethinking your nightcap may be just what you need to fall asleep faster while also &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8021156/foods-to-improve-gut-health-overnight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting gut health&lt;/a&gt;. And when it comes to which drink to sip on before bed, Hochreiter recommends opting for a warm mug of golden milk. In addition to lending a soothing aroma, the spices in this golden-hued beverage may help protect against inflammation in the gut and support healthy digestion. Plus, it’s a flavorful way to boost your fluid intake for the day. So what are you waiting for? Make sure your spice cabinet is stocked and brew yourself a cup of golden milk for a moment of Zen before bed—it might just lead to better zzz’s too!

Measles symptoms include fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, a skin rash as well as small white spots with bluish-white centers inside the mouth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Officials also advised that those who are immunocompromised, pregnant or unvaccinated should immediately contact their healthcare provider if they believe they’ve been exposed to measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, airborne virus that causes an infection that could lead to serious complications or death. Collin County officials said the virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The virus, however, spreads mostly amongst people who are not vaccinated against it.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alandria said she decided to research the symptoms - and became convinced her daughter has rickets, which causes weakened bones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Mansfield police arrested Alandria just before Thanksgiving and the couple temporarily lost custody of their daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple then hired attorney Shelly Troberman-Miller, who has become a specialist in medical kidnapping cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Together, they looked into the possibility that Jirah might have rickets, and discovered her early tests showed signs of bone health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Just the initial labs were so clearly indicative of a child who had some issue with bone health, that that should not have been ignored,' Troberman-Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also discovered that Quentin's family had a history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A judge ultimately returned the child to her parents in late March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A judge ultimately let Jirah reunite with her parents in late March, but Alandria continues to face criminal charges&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, prosecutors pursued an indictment against the mother, and a grand jury indictment claimed Alandria caused her daughter's injury by 'aggressively grabbing, twisting or pulling the arm of an infant child.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A heavily-redacted arrest warrant obtained by CBS News also described the incident as involving 'grabbing and pulling with force sufficient to cause the fracture.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alandria is now due to make her first court appearance next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, a spokesperson for Children's Health told the outlet that its 'top priority is the health and wellbeing of all our patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Due to patient privacy concerns, we do not discuss the status of individual patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Child Protective Services also declined to comment, citing confidentiality, but noted that it is complying with all court orders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 22:38:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNSmtxdmswR3lTSlMzeklodjk3SlZib0Z0alVHM0pBN3VPMG9CdzZ4WFgwTmRWY1JrQVRKOHVkRkd0WmNrVVE5N2laeGx2bnJYbktJVU5TNzVUdFB0M1FJSnRvVGNHSGNHcGhUbXFCcm1NeGNsTjJPRjE1TXEyU0dDZ2s3bUV3VnRNR2ZyVVB1Sk83cmF0MkY0WURVb19EMGpYeHhmUEYyelh1ZGVUdEZHQtIBtgFBVV95cUxPZW45MDE1U0kwSVk0bkFyVlBWa2Z6WjJFbXdUMDUtWWwwYWpMMmlZMG9BUldjZG9JZ3VxbG1lSm51Z2lqZVZreWVaSFV2MUF0NWlJazZvbHZNWFpOelhuSU1zcXV4aDQ1VWxSdjZNTFBIcDNqbDhSSEI0Y1RfNDlNTFFPamRiTTB1ZW5CMzhGNkVpc3VFV0RleUd0Y285alljLXgzMzhjRGtVNlRTb0JwOGxnaklQZw</guid></item><item><title>蜱虫给你的ick ？如果您、您的孩子或宠物被咬，您应该和不应该做什么—雅虎 | Ticks giving you the ick?

Tell them about the recent tick bite, when it occurred and the place it likely occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While a bull’s eye rash is a telltale sign of Lyme disease, it’s not the most common way a Lyme disease rash will present itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Fever, aches, and abrupt and severe fatigue can be the main symptoms of acute Lyme,” according to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://www.hopkinslyme.org/lyme-education/lyme-disease-prevention-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Johns Hopkins research center;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Johns Hopkins research center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-antibiotics-necessary-after-a-tick-bite"&gt;Are antibiotics necessary after a tick bite?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, the CDC doesn’t recommend taking antibiotics after a tick bite in order to prevent tick-borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“However, in certain circumstances, a single dose of doxycycline after a tick bite in an area where Lyme disease is common may lower risk of Lyme disease,” the CDC website says. It advises that people talk to their health care provider about whether antibiotics are right for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-found-a-tick-crawling-on-me-but-it-hasnt-attached-to-my-skin-can-i-get-sick"&gt;I found a tick crawling on me, but it hasn’t attached to my skin. Will I get sick?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No. A tick has to bite the skin and feed on a person’s or pet’s blood in order to spread any possible diseases. If you have found one crawling on you, another person or a pet, do a tick check for any other ones that may have attached. If found, remove promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-long-does-it-take-for-an-attached-tick-to-spread-disease"&gt;How long does it take for an attached tick to spread disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It depends on the type of tick and the disease.

You may have been bitten by a different tick that was infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The bottom line is that if you have been infected, you will likely develop symptoms before the test results are ready.

At the same time, the percentage of mothers who said their mental health was poor increased — particularly among those who were single parents, or whose children had Medicaid or were uninsured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings come at a fraught moment in the national conversation around parenting and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/health/birth-rates-cdc.html" title=""&gt;declining birthrates&lt;/a&gt;.

But just last year, Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, who was then the surgeon general, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/upshot/parents-stress-murthy-warning.html" title=""&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; about declining parental mental health in an advisory that described many who were raising children as “exhausted, burned out and perpetually behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The surgeon general’s report led the researchers behind the new study to begin analyzing data from nearly 200,000 mothers who participated in the National Survey of Children’s Health — an annual survey of households with children up to age 17. Researchers found that one in 20 mothers reported her mental health was poor or fair in 2016; by 2023 the ratio was about one in 12. In contrast, one in 22 fathers surveyed reported fair or poor mental health in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are limitations to the study, which was cross-sectional — meaning it looked at snapshots in time but did not follow the same women year over year. It also relied on self-reporting.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nearly half of adults in the U.S. have high blood pressure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Incorporating snacks with potassium, protein and fiber like our Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast can support healthy weight loss and blood pressure management. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple dietary adjustments, such as following the DASH diet and cooking at home, can significantly reduce sodium intake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm#:~:text=Nearly%20half%20of%20adults%20in,are%20taking%20medication%20for%20hypertension." data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, nearly half of adults have high blood pressure (that’s over 119.9 million people).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While there are many conditions that can influence someone having high blood pressure, data does suggest that adults who have a greater body fat percentage (adiposity) account for 65% to 78% of those diagnosed with primary hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having high blood pressure also puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death in America today.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Given these statistics, it's important to be proactive with small, simple changes that may have a big impact on your blood pressure. And one simple way of doing this is by including snacks that support both healthy blood pressure and weight management. And according to a dietitian, the #1 snack for weight loss when you have high blood pressure is this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261628/peanut-butter-banana-cinnamon-toast/#recipe-body" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast&lt;/a&gt;. The nutrients in this dynamic combo not only pair perfectly together, but also offer a big nutritional bang for your bite.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-its-so-great"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Why It's So Great  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; I'm not kidding when I say that as a registered dietitian nutritionist and busy mom of two, I eat this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261628/peanut-butter-banana-cinnamon-toast/#recipe-body" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast&lt;/a&gt; daily not only for its convenience, but also for its powerful benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don't believe me? Then take it from &lt;a href="http://www.olivetreenutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Rahaf Al Bochi, RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. She shares, "A combination of banana, peanut butter and whole-grain toast is a great snack because it provides protein, fiber-rich carbs and healthy fats, which helps keep your blood sugars stable, gives you energy and keeps you full."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Not to mention, this simple snack is a great source of several nutrients, and these are a few worth noting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s a Good Source of Potassium  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you've heard of potassium, you've likely heard bananas mentioned in the same sentence. That's because bananas are one of the best-known sources of potassium, an important electrolyte essential for keeping your body's fluid levels in balance. Potassium is a dynamic duo with sodium. Potassium works intracellularly to manage fluids, while sodium works extracellularly to help manage your blood pressure as well as keeping your heart pumping smoothly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A medium banana provides around 9% of the Daily Value of potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's not the highest food source of potassium (&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290053/8-foods-with-more-potassium-than-a-banana/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;apricots and potatoes actually pack more per serving&lt;/a&gt;), it's an easy, convenient and budget-friendly choice most people can find at their local grocer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Packed with Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Delicious and nutritious, a 2-tablespoon serving of peanut butter provides around 7 grams of protein, 12 grams of unsaturated fat and 2 grams of filling fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This trio of nutrients found in peanuts (and other nuts) has been shown to potentially help support weight-loss efforts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Plus, this combination has the satiation factor, meaning you're left feeling full and satisfied after eating, and are less likely to mindlessly munch.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Be mindful of the type of peanut butter you're choosing. While natural peanut butter is very low in added sugar and sodium, we know there are a variety of options on the market these days that do not have the same nutrition profile. Al Bochi recommends choosing a peanut butter that is "natural" and doesn't contain any added sugars.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Includes Whole Grains  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There's a reason why the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends making at least half your grains whole: they're packed with good nutrition!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Unlike their enriched or refined counterparts, whole grains contain the bran, germ and endosperm of wheat. This composition of whole grains—including whole-grain breads—provides fiber, which may benefit weight loss and heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A study found that replacing refined grains with whole grains led to a decline in body fat percentage and improvements in cholesterol and blood sugar levels, thus decreasing risk for cardiometabolic diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But, buyer beware: you need to be cognizant of the type of bread you're purchasing, because they aren't all created equally. Al Bochi shares, "Sometimes there can be hidden [added] sugars and salt in bread products, so choose products that contain 5% or less of Daily Value for sodium and sugar." Also, try to choose breads that offer at least 2 grams of dietary fiber and 4 or more grams of protein per slice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Consider the DASH Diet  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Al Bochi recommends that people with high blood pressure consider the&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2054270/how-to-follow-the-dash-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; DASH Diet&lt;/a&gt;: "The DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, has been shown to be effective in managing blood pressure. This eating pattern focuses on including plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy, beans, nuts, poultry and fish, while limiting sodium intake to under 2,300 milligrams per day."&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead of thinking about what you can't eat, focus on what you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; and try to add more of those foods to your daily meals and snacks. The nutrient combination in this snack can certainly fit into this eating pattern, especially when you choose a lower-sodium bread and peanut butter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Cook at Home  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Let's face it, we know you're busy and the convenience of picking up takeout or having a prepackaged meal can be lifesaving. However, it's important to be mindful of how frequently you're doing this, because fast foods and frozen meals often pack more sodium than you need (or want) in one meal. Al Bochi recommends cooking more foods at home to help cut back on your sodium intake. But, this doesn't have to mean you're cooking 21 meals at home every week!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Instead, try to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290651/a-beginners-guide-to-meal-prep/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;meal prep&lt;/a&gt; ahead of time and batch-cook a few proteins, complex carbohydrates and vegetables so you're ready to toss a simple meal together when time is tight. A scrambled egg omelet with roasted veggies can pair perfectly with the Peanut Butter-Banana Cinnamon Toast for a simple meal that comes together in no time flat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Losing weight while managing high blood pressure does not mean you have to live on a plain or lackluster diet.

The strain was first detected in international travelers arriving at US airports between late March and early April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, the variant has been found through airport surveillance testing at major entry points including California, Washington State, Virginia, and New York City. Separate reports have confirmed additional cases in Ohio, Rhode Island, and Hawaii, according to the New York Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the total cases remains low in the US and too sparse for CDC to track comprehensively, scientists warn that the variant may be significantly more transmissible.&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-personalisation" class="checktheseout2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
  &lt;p&gt;“It appears to have a growth advantage, suggesting it may spread more easily,” said Dr. Subhash Verma, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Nevada told CBS news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NB.1.8.1 variant has already become the dominant strain in China, leading to spikes in emergency room visits and hospital admissions across the country. In Hong Kong, authorities have reported the worst Covid surge in at least a year, noting 81 severe cases and 30 deaths within a four-week period, mostly among seniors over the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What they’re seeing in China, Hong Kong and some other areas where this variant has really surged, is an increase in hospitalization,” Dr. Amy Edwards of Case Western Reserve University’s medical school told CBS news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s airport screening program found that travelers carrying the NB.1.8.1 strain had recently passed through countries such as Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, Vietnam, Spain, and the Netherlands, suggesting a broad global footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the spike in cases abroad, experts say there is no current evidence that NB.1.8.1 is more deadly than previous strains. However, there are concerns it may be better at evading vaccine protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the US has stopped recommending routine Covid-19 vaccinations for healthy children and pregnant women. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, announced that the shots have been removed from the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 58-second video posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed Covid-19 shots from the CDC and Prevention's recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the US Department of Health and Human Services.'&lt;article&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some doctors and public health leaders called the move concerning and confusing. “There's no new data or information, just them flying by the seat of their pants,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1.2 million people have died in the US from Covid-19, most of them elderly. But children haven't been spared: The coronavirus has been the underlying cause in more than 1,300 childhood deaths since the pandemic began, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ALSO READ: &lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/us-space-shield-is-nuclear-war-scenario-north-korea-glbs-2731043-2025-05-27" target="_self"&gt;US space shield is 'nuclear war scenario': North Korea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dottedimg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="authors__container"&gt;&lt;div class="authors__by"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published By: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;Rivanshi Rakhrai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="published__on"&gt;&lt;p class="authlable"&gt;Published On: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="authdetaisl"&gt;May 28, 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"We had a lot of cases in one community. But with that, they've also built up natural immunity to measles, so that just adds more kind of speed bumps and slows down the virus from spreading."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Dr. Jason Schwartz, an associate professor of public health in the Yale School of Public Health, explained that measles is incredibly contagious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Just one infected patient can spread measles to up to nine out of 10 susceptible close contacts, according to the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html#:~:text=Up%20to%209%20out%20of,breathes%2C%20coughs%2C%20or%20sneezes." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Ultimately that reservoir of unvaccinated individuals -- who are either too young to be vaccinated or can't be vaccinated or had family members who chose not to vaccinate them -- ultimately that gets exhausted," he told ABC News.

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Tuesday announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138"&gt;58-second video&lt;/a&gt; posted on the social media site X, Kennedy said he removed COVID-19 shots from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendations for those groups. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No other details were released, and HHS officials did not immediately respond to questions about how the decision was made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some doctors and public health leaders called the move concerning and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s no new data or information, just them flying by the seat of their pants,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. health officials, following recommendations by infectious disease experts, have been urging annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of changing the recommendations is not completely out of the blue. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have increasingly discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older — who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-cdc-acip-kennedy-d9777cba947f5f52705af04d95e5f7fa"&gt;CDC advisory panel&lt;/a&gt; is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-kennedy-trump-covid-fda-novavax-b50f4d6fbcca378eb89b059bc8a91477"&gt;decided not to wait&lt;/a&gt; for the scientific panel’s review. He said that annual COVID-19 booster shots have been recommended for kids “despite the lack of any clinical data” to support that decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some physicians and public health leaders expressed concern that HHS officials disregarded a scientific review process that has been in place for decades, in which experts — in public meetings — review current medical evidence and hash out the pros and cons of policy changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a dangerous precedent. If you can start doing that with this vaccine, you can start doing that with any vaccine you want — including mumps-measles-rubella,” said Osterholm, referring to another vaccine that Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-rfk-jr-messaging-criticism-vaccine-1a2cbdc14eb0c256695fdfac00cbfb6d"&gt;voiced doubts&lt;/a&gt; about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and others said the announcement raises an array of questions, including whether health insurance companies will keep covering COVID-19 vaccinations and how hard it will be now for people who want the shots to get them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The reason we give vaccines to healthy people is to keep them safe,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 1.2 million people have died in the U.S. from COVID-19, most of them elderly. But children haven’t been spared: The coronavirus has been the underlying cause in more than 1,300 childhood deaths since the pandemic began, according to CDC data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary and Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, head of the National Institutes of Health, appeared in the video with Kennedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, during the nomination process, Kennedy gave &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/childhood-vaccines-schedule-kennedy-trump-hhs-4d5e6c52c602f5edbcd837748605e9d0"&gt;assurances&lt;/a&gt; to wavering Republicans that he would not alter the federal vaccine schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since then, Kennedy and other Trump administration appointees &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-rfk-kennedy-trump-covid-fda-novavax-b50f4d6fbcca378eb89b059bc8a91477"&gt;have made big changes&lt;/a&gt; to the system for approval and use of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They added restrictions to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/novavax-covid19-vaccine-fda-a477c1aa612ceb293e70d904b46611b0"&gt;a recent vaccine approval&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, the FDA announced &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-fda-kennedy-covid-shots-rfk-trump-bb4de15b6ff955d6cd0b406aaec3cdc5"&gt;routine COVID-19 vaccine approvals&lt;/a&gt; will be limited to seniors and younger people with underlying medical risks, pending new research for healthy adults and children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the confusion created by Tuesday’s announcement, experts said, was the implication that the coronavirus isn’t dangerous to pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the height of the pandemic, deaths of women during pregnancy or shortly after childbirth &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-deaths-cdc-maternal-mortality-fbb4950245b517b4f4d57517b62556d9"&gt;soared&lt;/a&gt; to their highest level in 50 years. Indeed, pregnancy was on the list of health conditions that would qualify someone for a COVID-19 vaccination under FDA’s new guidance “framework” announced last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaccination has been recommended for pregnant women, in part, because it’s a way to pass immunity to newborns who are too young for vaccines and are vulnerable to infections. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To say that they are not at any risk is simply incorrect,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: “The science has not changed. It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, we've been told that sugar is a major culprit behind the global rise in type 2 diabetes. Now, emerging evidence from BYU researchers adds nuance to that message, suggesting that not all sugar sources carry the same risk.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study is &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2161831325000493" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis of its kind, BYU researchers—in collaboration with researchers from Germany-based institutions—found that the type and source of sugar may matter far more than previously thought. Researchers analyzed data from over half a million people across multiple continents, revealing a surprising twist: Sugar consumed through beverages—like soda and even &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/fruit+juice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;fruit juice&lt;/a&gt;—was consistently linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D). Meanwhile, other sugar sources showed no such link, and in some cases, were even associated with a lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first study to draw clear dose-response relationships between different sugar sources and type 2 diabetes risk," said Karen Della Corte, lead author and BYU nutritional science professor. "It highlights why drinking your sugar—whether from soda or juice—is more problematic for health than eating it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After correcting for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/body+mass+index/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;body mass index&lt;/a&gt;, excess energy intake and several other lifestyle risk factors, the researchers found the following dose-response relationships:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With each additional 12-oz serving of sugar-sweetened beverages (i.e., &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/soft+drinks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;soft drinks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+drinks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy drinks&lt;/a&gt; and sports drinks) per day, the risk of developing T2D increased by 25%. This strong relationship showed that the increased risk began from the very first daily serving with no minimum threshold below which intake appeared to be safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With each additional 8-oz serving of fruit juice per day (i.e., 100% fruit juice, nectars and juice drinks), the risk of developing T2D increased by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The above risks are relative not absolute. For example, if the average person's baseline risk of developing T2D is about 10%, four sodas a day could raise that to roughly 20%, not 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparatively, 20 g/day intakes of total sucrose (table sugar) and total sugar (the sum of all naturally occurring and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/added+sugars/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt; in the diet) showed an inverse association with T2D, hinting at a surprising protective association.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Why drinking sugar would be more problematic than eating sugar may come down to the differing metabolic effects. Sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice supply isolated sugars, leading to a greater glycemic impact that would overwhelm and disrupt liver metabolism, thereby increasing liver fat and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, dietary sugars consumed in or added to nutrient-dense foods, such as whole fruits, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dairy+products/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dairy products&lt;/a&gt;, or whole grains, do not cause metabolic overload in the liver. These embedded sugars elicit slower blood glucose responses due to accompanying fiber, fats, proteins and other beneficial nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fruit juice, even with some vitamins and nutrients, is much less beneficial. Because of its high and concentrated sugar content, the researchers conclude that fruit juice is a poor substitute for whole fruits, which provide more fiber to support better blood glucose regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study underscores the need for even more stringent recommendations for liquid sugars such as those in sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, as they appear to harmfully associate with metabolic health," Della Corte said. "Rather than condemning all added sugars, future dietary guidelines might consider the differential effects of sugar based on its source and form."&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas this year has been the center of the nation’s largest measles outbreak in more than two decades, as a mostly eradicated disease has sickened more than 700 in the state, sent dozens to hospitals and led to the death of two children who were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even as the outbreak slows, a bill approved by state lawmakers and sent to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott would make it significantly easier for parents to enroll their children in school without standard vaccinations for diseases such as measles, whooping cough, polio and hepatitis A and B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters say the bill streamlines an already legal exemption process that allows families to avoid vaccines for reasons of conscience, religious beliefs or medical reasons. It would let them download the required forms from a website instead of contacting state health officials and waiting for one to come in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill does not change which vaccines are required. However, critics say easing the exemption process opens a door to further outbreaks with potentially deadly results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If this bill becomes law, Texas is likely to see more illness, more death and higher health care costs for families and business,” Rekha Lakshmanan, chief strategy officer for Texas-based nonprofit Immunization Project, told state senators before the bill won final approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The outbreak (in Texas) is not a coincidence. It is the canary in the coal mine screaming at the top of its lungs,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exemption bill — as well as other bills passed by the Texas House on lawsuits against vaccine makers and removing immunization restrictions on organ transplants — are a snapshot of efforts across dozens of conservative states to question vaccines or roll back requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the national level, this wave has been buoyed by still-lingering pushback from the COVID-19 pandemic and the Trump administration’s embrace of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was one of the nation’s leading anti-vaccine advocates before being appointed secretary of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent federal data shows U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates have dipped since the pandemic — 92.7% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 95% before COVID-19 — and the proportion of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high. And last week, the “Make America Healthy Again” federal report on the nation’s health and wellness questioned the necessity of vaccine mandates for schoolkids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The national Association of Immunization Managers, an organization of state and local immunization officials, has been tracking nearly 600 vaccine-related bills across the country in 2025, and the majority would not be considered pro-vaccine, said Brent Ewig, the group’s the group’s chief policy officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We saw a spike in vaccine-related bills during the pandemic. The last few years it had been tapering off. With recent actions at the federal level, there has been a spike again,” Ewig said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Texas measles outbreak and vaccine requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles has been considered eliminated from the United States since 2000. The Texas outbreak started in late January in West Texas’ Mennonite communities that have been resistant to vaccines and distrustful of government intervention, and the highly contagious virus quickly jumped to other places with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many states, Texas requires children to obtain vaccines to protect against 11 diseases to attend public and private schools and child care centers. The state’s vaccination rates for the 2023-24 school year ranged between 93.78% for chicken pox to 95.78% for hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But parents can obtain exemptions for religious or personal reasons, or if a doctor determines it would not be safe because of a medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exemption rates in Texas have been rising for nearly two decades, with a dramatic spike over the last five years. According to the Texas Department of Health Services, the agency received exemption requests for nearly 153,000 students in the 2023-2024 fiscal year, up from 136,000 the previous year and nearly double the 77,000 requested in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Texas’ vaccine rollback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill on vaccine exemption paperwork would make it easier for parents to obtain the needed form by letting them download it to a computer or smartphone. The current system where parents ask state health officials to mail a paper copy to their home can sometimes take weeks. The form would still need to be notarized before it is turned in to a school and a student is enrolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advocates say the changes would help parents thread the bureaucratic process and get their children enrolled in school quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This bill is not about whether vaccines are good or bad, it’s about government efficiency and keeping kids in schools,” said Jackie Schlegal, founder of Texans for Medical Freedom, which advocates for “vaccine freedom of choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics argue that simplifying the exemption form process makes it too easy for unvaccinated kids to enroll in a school, endangering the health of other kids and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For years Texas has struck a delicate balance of parents’ right and public health and safety,” Lakshmanan said. “This bill is more than just a form … We can support parents without putting other families at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still waiting for a Senate vote is a bill that would allow vaccine makers who advertise in Texas to be sued if their vaccine causes a person to be injured. That bill has been opposed by the Texas Association of Manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author of that bill is first-term state Rep. Shelley Luther, who was briefly jailed in 2020 for opening her Dallas salon in violation of governor’s emergency order during the pandemic. Abbott quickly weakened his enforcement of coronavirus safeguards and a court ordered her released.&lt;/p&gt;

What might all these symptoms have in common? They can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa764"&gt;all be signs of menopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But could these symptoms hint at a greater story? New research suggests that menopause symptoms are not just immediate hurdles to overcome; they might also hold clues about a person’s future health, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03564-3"&gt;including their risk for conditions like dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, to understand this connection, we must first understand what menopause is and how it affects the brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is menopause?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause marks the natural end of a woman’s menstrual periods, typically occurring in their late 40s or early 50s. Officially, menopause describes the specific day when someone has gone a full year without a period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, menopause doesn’t happen overnight. It often starts years earlier with a phase called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa764"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, the body prepares for menopause, and hormone levels — especially estrogen — fluctuate. This transition can last several years, often bringing symptoms like irregular periods, hot flashes, mood swings and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once periods stop completely, a woman enters postmenopause. Unfortunately, symptoms don’t always end here; some may persist for years, and new symptoms may appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stages — perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause — are all part of the same journey, though &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13697137.2024.2445303"&gt;each person’s experience is unique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An all too similar patient’s journey&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While menopause is a natural process, its &lt;a href="https://www.endo.theclinics.com/article/S0889-8529(22)00037-8/abstract"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; can feel anything but. Some people may experience mild or no symptoms, while others struggle with numerous and severe symptoms that disrupt &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/menopause"&gt;daily life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms like anxiety can make socializing difficult, sleep problems can lead to exhaustion and brain fog can make even simple tasks feel daunting. Together, these challenges can affect thoughts, feelings and social lives — key aspects to overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why menopause matters beyond the present&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding menopause and its symptoms is just the beginning. Beyond being a transitional phase, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.maturitas.2024.108130"&gt;challenges of menopause&lt;/a&gt; may offer a unique window into future brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia, marked by progressive memory loss, emotional and personality changes, and eventually, a loss of independence. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2020.100879"&gt;Women are twice as likely as men&lt;/a&gt; to develop Alzheimer’s disease. In the past, research thought this difference was because women live longer than men, but new research suggests that menopause-related hormone changes may also play a critical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of hormones in brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During menopause, the ovaries stop producing eggs, triggering significant &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/endocrines2040036"&gt;hormonal changes&lt;/a&gt;. One major change is the drop in estrogen, a hormone not only essential for reproduction, but also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11010-024-05071-4"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen helps protect memory, strengthen neural connections, regulate mood and remove harmful proteins from the brain. When estrogen levels fall, these health benefits may weaken, possibly leaving the brain and body more vulnerable to harmful changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During these hormonal changes, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ogc.2018.07.004"&gt;menopause symptoms may also emerge&lt;/a&gt;. While symptoms were once thought to be temporary, albeit uncomfortable, side-effects of menopause, these symptoms may also signal underlying brain changes linked to dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future cognitive and behavioural health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While past research has examined how individual menopausal symptoms may relate to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/gme.0000000000001910"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;, our research team (led by Dr. Zahinoor Ismail, a physician-scientist) asked: could the number of symptoms experienced also indicate early warning signs of dementia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explored this by analyzing changes in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cognition (for example, memory, thinking, and problem-solving) and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behaviour (for example, emotions, personality, and social interactions).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cognitive changes are often top of mind when thinking about dementia, behavioural changes are equally important but frequently overlooked, and might also be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2024.02.006"&gt;early warning signs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined data from 896 postmenopausal participants in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ahr.2024.100207"&gt;CAN-PROTECT study&lt;/a&gt;, an online Canadian project on aging and brain health. Participants recalled the type and number of symptoms they experienced during perimenopause and completed tests assessing their current cognition and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the participants, 74.3 per cent experienced perimenopausal symptoms — an average four symptoms per person — with hot flashes (88 per cent) and night sweats (70 per cent) being most common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0301165"&gt;Our findings&lt;/a&gt; revealed that experiencing more symptoms during perimenopause was associated with greater cognitive and behavioural changes later in life, suggesting the burden of perimenopausal symptoms not only affected immediate well-being, but could also signal long-term brain health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, these findings highlight the importance of recognizing menopausal symptoms as potential early indicators of future brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants who used estrogen-based hormone therapies for perimenopausal symptoms showed fewer behavioural changes than non-users, suggesting a possible role for estrogen in dementia risk reduction. However, further research is critical &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt1288"&gt;to clarify the timing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5498/wjp.v11.i8.412"&gt;long-term effects&lt;/a&gt; of hormone therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to understand that these findings show a relationship between symptom burden and later brain health, but do not prove that one causes the other. We still need more research to understand why a connection exists and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this research matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research highlights a crucial link: experiencing multiple perimenopausal symptoms may be related to cognitive and behavioural changes, which are early risk markers of dementia. Recognizing these symptoms as potential warning signs could help health care providers identify risks sooner and explore ways to protect brain health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause is more than a life transition; it may offer critical insights into long-term brain health. Supporting research like &lt;a href="https://www.can-protect.ca/"&gt;CAN-PROTECT&lt;/a&gt;, which is still recruiting participants, can help us uncover how menopause experiences shape dementia risk, paving the way for earlier interventions and better outcomes.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253216/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/253216/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

        &lt;p&gt;Genetic defects are exceedingly common, which is not surprising considering just how many cells make up our bodies, including our reproductive cells. While most of these defects have no or only minor effects, some range from serious to fatal. One of these defects is in the CPS1 gene, with those affected facing a shortened lifespan along with intensive treatments and a liver transplant as the only real solution. This may now be changing, after &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/infant-rare-incurable-disease-first-successfully-receive-personalized-gene-therapy-treatment" target="_blank"&gt;the first successful genetic treatment&lt;/a&gt; of an infant with CPS1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamoyl_phosphate_synthetase_I" target="_blank"&gt;CPS1&lt;/a&gt;) is an enzyme that is crucial for breaking down the ammonia that is formed when proteins are broken down. If the body doesn’t produce enough of this enzyme in the liver, ammonia will accumulate in the blood, eventually reaching levels where it will affect primarily the nervous system. As an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder it requires both parents to be carriers, with the severity depending on the exact mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the affected infant, KJ Muldoon, the CPS1 deficiency was severe with only a low-protein diet and ammonia-lowering (nitrogen scavenging) medication keeping the child alive while a search for a donor liver had begun. It is in this context that in a few months time a CRISPR-Cas9 therapy was developed that so far appears to fixing the faulty genes in the liver cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CPS1 Gene Deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its toxicity to living beings, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia" target="_blank"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt; (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is an essential part of these same living beings, primarily in the form of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amine" target="_blank"&gt;amines&lt;/a&gt; (R-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), itself a rather indispensable part of amino acids, specifically the 22 &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinogenic_amino_acid" target="_blank"&gt;proteinogenic amino acids&lt;/a&gt; from which proteins are formed. Just as ammonia is required for the amination process, so too is ammonia formed inside the body mostly as the result of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transamination" target="_blank"&gt;transamination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deamination" target="_blank"&gt;deamination&lt;/a&gt; of these biogenic amines. This is a process that takes place primarily in the liver and involves the deamination of both the body’s own waste proteins as well as those from one’s diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since only part of the ammonia can be reused for new amino acids, the rest has to be neutralized. Due to the toxicity of ammonia, blood levels have to be limited to &amp;lt;50 µmol/L or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperammonemia" target="_blank"&gt;hyperammonemia&lt;/a&gt; will occur. This is where the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea_cycle" target="_blank"&gt;urea cycle&lt;/a&gt; comes into play to maintain a healthy ammonia level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very first step of the urea cycle is the conversion of ammonia to carbamoyl phosphate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;span class="chemf nowrap"&gt;HCO&lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; + 2&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate" title="Adenosine triphosphate" target="_blank"&gt;ATP&lt;/a&gt; → 2ADP + Carbamoyl phosphate + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally this is a very slow reaction, which is where the enzyme CSP1 comes into play as catalyst. In humans the gene for this enzyme is located on chromosome 2’s long arm, at locus 2q34. If there is a mutation in this gene that prevents it from working as a catalyst, ammonia levels in blood plasma will keep rising, eventually reaching levels where the nervous system is affected. In infants this is noticeable as lethargy, seizures and a lack of normal developmental milestones. Without treatment, developmental delay, intellectual disability or death affect 50% of babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Undoing A Mutation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When KJ was born on August 2024, it was noticed that he was lethargic, with stiff muscles and other worrisome symptoms. After a severe CPS1 deficiency was diagnosed via genome sequencing, KJ was hospitalized at only five months old. KJ’s only hope appeared to be a liver transplant and was put on the list for a donor organ, providing a slim hope at best. Meanwhile, a team of researchers started researching the cause of KJ’s CPS1 deficiency and the mutations behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://erictopol.substack.com/p/the-first-human-to-undergo-in-vivo" target="_blank"&gt;described by Dr. Eric Topol&lt;/a&gt; in his summary of the (paywalled) &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2505721" target="_blank"&gt;paper by Gropman et al.&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt;, both the father and mother were found to be carriers for CPS1 mutations, with the father carrying the truncating Q335X variant and the mother another (E714X). If either mutation could be corrected, the child would have one functional copy and theoretically be able to produce enough CPS1 to have a functional urea cycle without external assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A complicating issue here is that despite the many reports of gene-editing with CRISPR the past years, there are various gradations, with what Dr. Topol refers to as CRISPR 1.0 through 3.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRISPR 1.0: A CRISPR-Cas9 tool causes sufficient double-strand damage to disable the gene (knock-out). Crude and not relevant here. Also performed &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRISPR 2.0: Introduced single-strand cuts that allow for limited base editing, e.g. swapping A for a G.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CRISPR 3.0. Expands base editing to include multiple base pairs, both &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These methods have previously already been used &lt;em&gt;ex vivo&lt;/em&gt; to create &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/11/27/car-t-cell-immunotherapy-and-the-quiet-hope-for-a-universal-cancer-treatment/"&gt;modified T-cells for CAR T-cell immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt; in the context of cancer treatments. In terms of &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; treatments, there is the 2023 knocking out of &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/base-editing-a-new-form-of-gene-therapy-sharply-lowers-bad-cholesterol" target="_blank"&gt;PCSK9 liver protein&lt;/a&gt; to reduce bad cholesterol levels and the more recent base editing of the &lt;a href="https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-announces-positive-initial-data-beam-302-phase" target="_blank"&gt;PiZ mutation&lt;/a&gt; responsible for liver and lung damage. There’s also &lt;a href="https://precisionbiosciences.com/arcus-genome-editing/" target="_blank"&gt;ARCUS&lt;/a&gt;, which is a viral vector-based method of base editing that has seen use in fixing another urea cycle-related disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although only CRISPR 2.0 was needed here, what was unique in the case of KJ was that this would be the first fully personalized base editing therapy, applied &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; and developed within the span of a mere six months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With how experimental this gene therapy for KJ’s CPS1 disorder was, the researchers had to go through the entire gamut of tests, including on animal models. With a base editor developed to target the father’s Q335X mutation and rewrite it to the correct base pairs, mice were bred that had the same CSP1 mutation, in addition to testing on non-human primates, all to validate the approach and gain FDA approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The base editor’s goal was to rewrite the the wrong bases at the Q335X location on locus 2q34. A concern with any application of CRISPR is so-called off-target edits, but the safety review seems to have passed here without serious issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with a very low dose, blood plasma ammonia levels were carefully monitored with no noticeable changes. Three weeks later the second, higher dose was injected, with reportedly positive effects on the ammonia levels. A third dose was injected a while later, though the results of this aren’t know yet. In the absence of a liver biopsy it is hard to say in how far this is a true cure, as reported so far is a reduced need for medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per reports, KJ is however doing better, hitting developmental targets and got over two viral infections, without an ammonia crisis. Further injections of the treatment will likely administered with an mRNA approach rather than the (presumed) virus vector used so far due to immunity concerns with a virus vector. Open questions remain regarding how many cells have been truly edited in KJ’s liver and what the overall effectiveness is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to cautiously welcome this news as a step forward in personalized gene-therapy, while realizing that the road ahead for both KJ and the rest of us is still full of unknowns and challenges. That said, one can only hope for KJ’s best possible progress and ideally serving as a beacon of hope for others afflicted by genetic disorders like CPS1 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

New data out of the US, including over 1,000 children, is showing that the symptoms of long COVID look different in those aged up to 2 years and those aged 3-5. Added to what we already know about this condition in teens and adults, the findings help complete more of the puzzle of the potential aftereffects of a bout of &lt;a href="http://www.iflscience.com/tags/covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and doctors have been aware of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-finally-has-a-definition-and-over-200-possible-symptoms-74657" target="_blank"&gt;long COVID&lt;/a&gt; since the first year of the pandemic, but fully getting to grips with the condition has been a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-risk-factors-revealed-in-data-from-nearly-5000-people-74693" target="_blank"&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-patients-say-they-still-struggle-to-convince-medics-their-illness-is-real-78584" target="_blank"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt; process. First, there was the conundrum of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/females-have-increased-risk-of-long-covid-says-study-of-over-12000-participants-77733" target="_blank"&gt;previously healthy adults&lt;/a&gt; afflicted with lasting symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-fatigue-may-be-down-to-a-protein-that-we-could-target-with-drugs-75306" target="_blank"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-brain-fog-very-well-explained-by-altered-levels-of-2-key-biomarkers-79218" target="_blank"&gt;brain fog&lt;/a&gt;, and breathlessness after a seemingly mild dose of COVID. Then came the question of whether our children might be at risk too – and when it became clear that &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/long-covid-affects-kids-and-teens-too-and-were-now-starting-to-learn-how-75645" target="_blank"&gt;they were&lt;/a&gt;, the research could really begin into how best to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine is adding more to the picture by examining what long COVID symptoms can look like in some of the youngest patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 472 children under 2 years of age, and 539 children aged 3-5 years. The authors believe that this is the first study of its kind in these age groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, 41 percent of the 278 toddlers whose parents reported them having had COVID-19 had at least one prolonged symptom. The proportion was similar in the preschool group, with 45 percent of the 399 children having a lasting symptom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The younger children were more likely to experience difficulty sleeping, increased fussiness, poor appetite, a stuffy nose, and a cough. The older kids, on the other hand, most often displayed a dry cough and daytime sleepiness or low energy. “Symptom patterns were distinguishable across infants/toddlers and preschool-aged children, and from previously studied older children and adults,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were some limitations to the analysis, which the study authors note. It’s possible that some of the children were miscategorized, as it wasn’t possible to confirm a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with an antibody test in the whole cohort. It’s also possible that some of the supposed long COVID symptoms may have followed infection with a &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/widespread-availability-of-rsv-vaccine-linked-to-fall-in-baby-hospitalizations-79163" target="_blank"&gt;different virus&lt;/a&gt;, and caregivers may also have misremembered or misinterpreted some of the children’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the authors say, “Despite potential for misclassification, groups with and without infection demonstrated clear differences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.1415?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapediatrics.2025.1415" target="_blank"&gt;patient information page&lt;/a&gt; published in the same journal, three of the study’s authors write that almost 6 million US children could be affected by long COVID, which is greater than the number of kids with &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/game-changer-drug-is-first-new-asthma-attack-treatment-in-50-years-77058" target="_blank"&gt;asthma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of their research and previous data, they show how children and young people with long COVID can be split into four broad groups, with slightly different symptom profiles that parents and caregivers can look out for: 0-2 years, 3-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings support the concept that a one-size-fits-all approach to screening for [long COVID] across the lifespan is not possible and will likely need to be tailored for specific age groups,” they conclude in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study comes in the wake of proposed changes to the Food and Drug Administration’s approach to COVID vaccination going forward. As Katherine J. Wu wrote recently for &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/05/covid-shots-kids-fda-boosters/682880/" target="_blank"&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt;, the agency’s dwindling support for booster shots for those without preexisting health conditions or other risk factors could mean that, in essence, “COVID shots for kids are over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance remains that everyone aged &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html" target="_blank"&gt;6 months and older&lt;/a&gt; in the US should get an up-to-date COVID shot. If that were to change, we could see a generation of children starting kindergarten and school without any protection against a virus that is still very much out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least in adults, the &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/covid-19-vaccination-reduces-risk-long-covid-adults" target="_blank"&gt;latest evidence&lt;/a&gt; points to a protective role of vaccination against the risk of long COVID. It can’t eliminate the risk altogether, and there’s been a lack of research specifically focusing on children. But still, the idea of removing this layer of protection for the nation’s kids is one that is certain to cause concern in some quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with other &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/trump-administrations-proposed-budget-slashes-nasa-noaa-health-research-79068" target="_blank"&gt;recent decisions&lt;/a&gt; taken by this administration, the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/top-us-scientists-write-open-letter-to-the-american-people-we-see-real-danger-in-this-moment-78642" target="_blank"&gt;consequences&lt;/a&gt; may take years to fully emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.1066?guestAccessKey=9d614ff8-16bb-424b-b9f3-28dd1a7801f9&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=052725" target="_blank"&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 16:20:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxOZVpKYXZEQXJKTmZEbFA5Wnc0U1ZFTlQ0OWl1S3pBUEExYzd2OVczM2lMWGFYNWxScV9iZEhibUtqSlJabjFIdnloRll4b2VvUXRSVWJobE4tZkhvRDlpUVhPMFowdy1TajlHMDBIQVpJOThOaDhkWjNYLWJLcHhpV1VBWEdNX3ZPM09yZFZuMkxfYWdORWl4WktXMENNUEktaTVra2laWjFQMHNaMVYtU3JrUQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现微塑料对人脑的潜在影响-雅虎 | Scientists Discover Alarming Potential Impact of Microplastics on the Human Brain - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPdDg4SkI4YUtHbW9hMURlWUktN0dYZHhycndlVkFFNTdPSW1JbEFmd3U0YlJKckluVmRieVljTHU0UjRoR3g3bFNsdkw3enRPelNmQWlQMFVHR3NhR3N3QXJoblFyenRPMnlUT3ZTUHRaTG1uOVBUd2d0OHl2YzlEZ0dXRDZMX29UZ1FtQV85azM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Research has detected a “spoonful” of microplastics in the average brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The impact of these is still being studied. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experts break down how microplastics could impact mood disorders, dementia risk, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class="my-4"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Research has detected microplastics in a range of vital body parts, including the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-024-03453-1&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prevention.com%2Fhealth%2Fhealth-conditions%2Fa64849102%2Fmicroplastics-human-brain-mental-health-study%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.

However, there are links being formed, especially when it comes to brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Some studies have found an association between higher levels of microplastics in the brain and certain brain disorders such as dementia, depression, and anxiety,” says &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/ccm/person/jo-ellen-wilson-mdphd-mph" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jo Ellen Wilson, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Jo Ellen Wilson, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H.&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. “The direction of association of this effect remains unclear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She points to this debate scientists are currently having about the impact of microplastics on dementia rates: Do higher levels of microplastics in the brain cause brain disorders like dementia, or do people who have conditions like dementia, who already have a more permeable blood-brain barrier, build up more microplastics in their brain because their brains are more permeable? “This question of causation is an important one and has not yet been answered,” Dr. Wilson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the potential impact of microplastics in the brain likely depends on where the microplastics end up, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, D.O.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Clifford Segil, D.O.&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If microplastics are truly entering the brain and affecting brain neurotransmitter function, then the effects would correlate for wherever in the brain is accumulating these microplastics,” he says. “If the front of the brain collects microplastics, they could cause behavioral issues, versus if the temporal lobes or the side of the brain collects microplastics, they could cause cognitive issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any way to get rid of microplastics in your brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As of this moment, no. “The idea of microplastics being able to get inside of the brain is novel, and if true, the next step would be to determine where in the brain they are accumulating, and then reverse engineer whatever method they are using to find their way into the brain to help find a way to get them out of our brains,” Dr. Segil says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Wilson says that doing your best to reduce your exposure to microplastics may help. “We know that by reducing your exposure to plastics, over time, you may be able to decrease microplastic burden in your body,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is some &lt;a href="https://iadns.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fft2.437#:~:text=A%20large%20number%20of%20studies,MPs%20exposure%20on%20intestinal%20health." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that eating plenty of fiber could help reduce microplastics’ impact on your body, but more work is needed, says &lt;a href="https://www.medstarhealth.org/doctors/kelly-krisna-johnson-arbor-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kelly Johnson-Arbor, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Kelly Johnson-Arbor, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a toxicologist at MedStar Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to reduce your microplastic exposure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics are practically everywhere, making them hard to avoid. But there are a few things you can do to try to lower your exposure to these tiny particles. “Certain water filters, especially those that feature smaller filter pore sizes, may be able to reduce human exposure to microplastics by removing the particles from drinking water,” Dr. Johnson-Arbor says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Avoiding the use of plastic in general—including plastic food containers and water bottles—can be helpful, but Dr. Johnson-Arbor points out that this can be a “challenge” because plastic products are so common in everyday life. “Even though many grocery stores don’t use plastic bags at checkout, plastic products can still be found in the bags that we put fresh fruits and vegetables in at the grocery store, and the plastic wrap that covers pre-cut meat and produce,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She suggests using bamboo or wood cutting boards, since plastic boards can become damaged over time and transfer microplastics to food that is being cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Finally, Dr. Johnson-Arbor recommends using bamboo, metal, or glass food storage containers instead of plastic, and to avoid reheating foods in plastic containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Again, microplastics are all over the place, making it hard to fully cut them from your life. But doing what you can to lessen your exposure may help protect your overall health—and your brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 15:59:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPdDg4SkI4YUtHbW9hMURlWUktN0dYZHhycndlVkFFNTdPSW1JbEFmd3U0YlJKckluVmRieVljTHU0UjRoR3g3bFNsdkw3enRPelNmQWlQMFVHR3NhR3N3QXJoblFyenRPMnlUT3ZTUHRaTG1uOVBUd2d0OHl2YzlEZ0dXRDZMX29UZ1FtQV85azM</guid></item><item><title>美国只有25 ％的母亲报告“优秀”的心理健康状况，这标志着惊人的下降- ABC新闻 | Only 25% of moms in US report 'excellent' mental health, marking an alarming decline - ABC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxPOVZyNERVQ2RfTmxwTGU1czRfd2kyVEZOMGdVeTI2d3lFUmVEQTlDWEd0MWs4ZFp6bm9PYS14emY1clFnbVFsUzdQTUwxaWljeHA4MHAzNF9zUU9rWUJtUnl6Yjd0Y2xjUWs3OXdQNmF5bGl5eXUtYkY4ZVRCUkFPZ21lRjduamRrZU9mSzMwelBKQnfSAZgBQVVfeXFMTU1lS0xGcTBXbFd3WjR1d24wRUxta05jMEJYZVFCMHQ4ZEpWaml5WnlhaHEzSHFkem9fYVUxekJqR1lGdlF1a3dfMmhvb3pqUHlCVjkzQmJYWFVid2FqUXJiSW1hZ0t5WVI2STMxOWRBcEpsTTFVeHdyeFpuRDFaNUt5N2Job0VjS2tETDdyaFJxZHdVdm9OeTU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A growing number of &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/video/shining-light-maternal-mental-health-122070144" target="_blank"&gt;mothers&lt;/a&gt; are struggling with their &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/story/us-surgeon-general-issues-advisory-parents-mental-health-113212536" target="_blank"&gt;mental&lt;/a&gt; and physical health, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The study, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2834318?guestAccessKey=34776585-5282-4bb2-ad57-b984aa76d938&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=052725" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Internal Medicine, surveyed 189,417 mothers from 2016 to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The findings show a sharp drop in maternal mental health, with only 25.8% reporting “excellent” mental health in 2023, down from 38.4% in 2016. In addition to the decline in "excellent" mental health, mothers describing their health as just "good" rose from 18.8% to 26.1%, and "fair/poor" rose from 5.5% to 8.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We found a dramatic increase in mothers reporting fair or poor health -- a 64% increase,” Jamie Daw, lead author of the study and assistant professor at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, told ABC News. “These declines originated before the pandemic, suggesting this is due to broader societal and population level factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Physical health also declined over this period, with 15% fewer mothers reporting “excellent” physical health, and more women reporting just “good” health. These effects, however, were felt disproportionately with vulnerable mothers -- single, younger, with less education and whose kids were multiracial, publicly insured, or uninsured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Experts warn that worsening maternal mental health can have a ripple effect across generations. Poor mental health in mothers is linked to problems during childbirth, early childhood development, and long-term physical and mental health of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“We know that poor mental health contributes to maternal mortality, and it increases the risk of other poor health outcomes for both mom and baby,” said Dr. Jade Cobern, a board-certified physician in pediatrics and preventive medicine and fellow of the ABC News Medical Unit. “As a pediatrician, I know firsthand that a mother’s health is integral to a child’s overall health and well-being."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She continued, "I tell all my patients' mothers that taking care of their own health is a part of taking care of their baby’s health and should be prioritized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Fathers also reported declines in mental health, though mothers were consistently worse off -- one in 12 mothers reported "fair/poor" mental health compared to one in 22 fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These findings add urgency to the national conversation about parents’ mental health. Most research has focused on mothers around childbirth, but this study suggests parental support needs to be extended beyond the postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“[We] need to reframe maternal mental health to not only be focused on pregnancy and postpartum. American mothers who are parenting children of all ages are reporting worse mental health,” said Daw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The U.S. surgeon general issued an advisory on parental pressures in August 2024, calling for policy changes, community programs and individual action to preserve the mental health of caregivers, naming it a public health priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“As a society and medical community, we have to continue to protect and prioritize mental health resources for all parents so families can thrive,” said Cobern. “There is no shame in speaking up about mental health.

These individuals also tended to report slightly higher levels of attachment anxiety. The paper was published in the &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-025-03120-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archives of Sexual Behavior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Childhood trauma refers to serious adverse experiences during childhood that overwhelm a child’s ability to cope and can have lasting psychological effects. These may include physical, emotional, or sexual abuse; neglect; witnessing domestic violence; the loss of a parent; or chronic exposure to instability or danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traumatic events can disrupt normal brain development and affect memory, emotion regulation, and learning. Children exposed to trauma may develop anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, or behavioral issues. They may struggle with trust, self-esteem, and forming healthy relationships later in life. The impact of trauma often persists into adulthood, influencing physical health, mental well-being, and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Noémie Bigras and her colleagues set out to examine whether greater childhood trauma is associated with the duration of experienced and expressed positive and negative emotions during a sexual conflict discussion between romantic partners. They also explored whether attachment anxiety and avoidance mediate the relationship between childhood trauma and these emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, sexual conflict refers to an eight-minute discussion about the most important sexual problem identified by one or both partners in a couple. Attachment avoidance and anxiety are two dimensions of adult attachment. Attachment avoidance reflects discomfort with closeness, emotional distancing, and self-reliance. Attachment anxiety reflects fear of rejection, preoccupation with the relationship, and a need for reassurance and closeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study participants were 151 couples recruited from two Canadian cities through online advertisements, posters, and word of mouth between May 2019 and January 2020. To be eligible, participants needed to be at least 18 years old, have a history of sexual activity with their partner (broadly defined), be fluent in French or English, be in a monogamous relationship, and have lived with their current partner for at least one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the study, couples took part in a laboratory session that involved four discussion tasks: a five-minute warm-up discussion about everyday events; an eight-minute discussion of a previously undisclosed personal positive experience; an eight-minute discussion about their most significant sexual concern (the sexual conflict task); and a five-minute cooldown discussion about each other’s attractive qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (short form) and the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire to assess trauma history and attachment style, respectively. After the sexual conflict discussion, they reported the emotions they experienced using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. In addition, the researchers assessed the duration of emotional experiences and expressions during the conflict by analyzing video footage using joystick-based continuous ratings provided by the participants and trained observers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that individuals with higher levels of childhood trauma tended to report experiencing slightly fewer positive emotions and slightly more negative emotions following the sexual conflict. They were also observed and self-reported to have shorter durations of positive emotions during the interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greater trauma exposure was also associated with slightly higher attachment anxiety. Statistical modeling indicated that attachment anxiety helped explain (i.e., mediated) the link between childhood trauma and post-discussion emotional responses. Specifically, individuals with greater trauma histories tended to have higher attachment anxiety, which in turn was linked to more negative and fewer positive emotional experiences during the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Results showed how the experience of childhood trauma both by itself and via attachment anxiety can make conflictual discussions surrounding sexuality more triggering and distressing and therefore elicit more difficult emotions to recover. As positive emotions appear to be processed differently than negative emotions, results also invite clinicians and researchers to not dwell exclusively on the manifestations of negative emotions in the aftermath of childhood trauma,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the links between childhood trauma and experiences in sexual conflict. However, it should be noted that the reported associations were all very weak, almost negligible. Additionally, the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-025-03120-7"&gt;Attachment Insecurity Mediates the Associations Between Childhood Trauma and Duration of Emotions During a Laboratory‑Based Sexual Confict Discussion Among Couples,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Noémie Bigras, Natalie O. Rosen, Justin P. Dubé, Marie‑Ève Daspe, Myriam Bosisio, Katherine Péloquin, and Sophie Bergeron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 14:36:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxOVUI2MkpMU09VSkFrR19SMFg5LTVoSVhpalJZc0NpaVlJVkxwc0VwdnlwSWV2OFpuQjZzcVN1SUNYSFlPMHZ3d2h1cnpaMlJzaUtXaWdJMlptVTFPc2V1c1B1ZFRQcmJmVzFSMksxc2ZVazRzbkwzckpaZU1WV0hDQVcwT19nUXRKMW9tREpoSjUyX0tMNGFfU1ZwYXJlczFfRUZmT2JPUXFnNUdk</guid></item><item><title>具有罕见基因突变的精子捐赠者生育了67名儿童。现在有10人患有癌症，促使人们呼吁改革- CNN | Sperm donor with rare genetic mutation fathered 67 children.

    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6ehrbx00ez27nz8q5mah9v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The sperm of a man carrying a rare genetic mutation linked to cancer was used to conceive scores of children across Europe, prompting calls for greater regulation and a limit on the number of births allowed from a single donor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6f28yt0019356mi4u63088@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sperm from the donor was used to conceive at least 67 children from 46 families born between 2008 and 2015, said Edwige Kasper, a biologist at Rouen University Hospital in France, during a presentation at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Genetics in Milan on Saturday. Ten of the children have already been diagnosed with cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6gpozu0032356m20wplwun@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the heart of the problem seems to lie the regulation, or maybe the lack of regulation, of the number of births by a single donor,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6fbgec001h356mnl0ldvaa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Analysis showed that the donor, who is himself healthy, had a rare mutation in a gene named TP53, which is likely to cause Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare disorder that increases a person’s risk of developing cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6g0cqy002f356mt26tu9v4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mutation was not known when the donation was made, but children born from this donor have since been identified in eight different European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom, said Kasper in her presentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6h3hcg003r356mws22fe23@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ten of them have been diagnosed with cancers such as brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma, and another 13 children are carrying the gene but have not yet developed a cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6grtpp0038356mj36e1xzb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They will require regular medical examinations due to their increased risk of developing cancer, and have a 50% chance of transmitting it on to their own children, said Kasper.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6hdhbx0000356mqy0a5m1c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The follow-up protocol involves whole-body MRI scans, MRI scans of the brain and, for adults, of the breast, ultrasound examination of the abdomen, and a clinical examination by a specialist. This is heavy and stressful for carriers, but we have seen its effectiveness in that it has enabled early detection of tumours and thus improved patients’ chances of survival,” said Kasper in a press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6gs1d2003b356mqi9pax0n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike in some cases of serial sperm donors, such as a Dutch man &lt;a href="https://cnn.com/2023/04/28/world/dutch-father-sperm-donor-children-scandal-intl-hnk"&gt;who was ordered to stop donating sperm&lt;/a&gt; after being found to have fathered between 500 and 600 children around the world, this man only donated to a single private sperm bank in Denmark named the European Sperm Bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6etx0b000i356m7yftddp1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Julie Paulli Budtz, vice-president of corporate communications at the European Sperm Bank, told CNN that it was “deeply affected by this case.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6g2vt0002j356mhdwjne0t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The donor has been thoroughly tested even above the required standards, but preventative genetic screening is reaching its limits here,” she said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6g5hvu002r356mp40an3cn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every human being has about 20,000 genes, and it is scientifically simply not possible to detect disease-causing mutations in a person’s gene pool if you don’t know what you are looking for.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6eyeap0013356mii49caa5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is currently no limit on the number of children that are allowed to be born using a single donor, something which Budtz said the European Sperm Bank would like to change.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6eq1er000d356m0z6wzxni@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is also why, in addition to following national pregnancy limits, we have proactively implemented our own international limit of 75 families per donor,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6k96mt0000356m8qfbw095@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This limit is self-imposed as regulations vary from country to country. For example, France has a limit of 10 births per donor, while Denmark allows 12 and Germany allows up to 15, according to the press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmb6iulzj0002356mwgocyx4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a major issue here concerning a lack of harmonised regulation across Europe,” Kasper said in the release. “We need proper regulation at European level to try to prevent it happening again, and to implement measures to ensure a worldwide limit on the number of offspring conceived from the same donor.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

Not only do they provide fiber, carbs and important micronutrients, they can also boost gut health and, depending on the fruit, improve a wide variety of functions in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Like vegetables, fruit, of course, is seasonal, which means that certain types pack in the most nutrients during specific times of year. But if you don't have access to fresh produce year-round, the good news is that eating frozen fruit actually has as many health benefits — plus you don't have the same time crunch for eating it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One fruit in particular has an especially short period where it's in season but is versatile with powerful health-boosting compounds.

"Many people don’t realize that frozen fruits and veggies are actually just as nutritious as fresh. They are frozen at the peak of freshness, locking in all the nutrients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-56e38e" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One cup of cherries has 25% of your daily vitamin C, an anti-inflammatory nutrient that aids in immune function. Cherries also have anthocyanins, which are antioxidants that give cherries their red color and reduce the risk of chronic diseases, like heart disease and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/health/are-cherries-good-for-you-rcna156645" target="_blank"&gt;Cherries&lt;/a&gt; can also boost skin health, sleep and exercise recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-de15b9" class="body-heading"&gt;How To Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"I always add cherries to my smoothies to add natural sweetness and fight inflammation," Rizzo says. "They are especially nice in a post-workout smoothie to ease inflammation in the joints. Plus, cherries are only in season for a short amount of time, so keeping my freezer stocked with them means I can eat them all year round."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-46318e" class="styles_card__SCi76" data-testid="article-card"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_imageWrapper__O37vg" data-testid="article-card-image"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_tiltWrapper__BcdP_"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/recipes/workout-recovery-smoothie-recipe-t215841"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_coverImage__L6GCV" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1240px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-860x430,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-860x430,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-920x460,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-920x460,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 758px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-720x360,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-720x360,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-600x300,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-600x300,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-600x300,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_16/1705428/workout-recovery-smoothie-te-main-210421.jpg" alt="Workout Recovery Smoothie"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="styles_byline__zDQzc"&gt;Mitch Mandel / Smoothies &amp;amp; Juices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content-link-card styles_txtWrapper__3rsLX" data-testid="article-card-text"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_author__l7Srn" data-testid="article-card-author"&gt;Frances Largeman-Roth, RDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;(Photo by Basicdog on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anxiety affects &lt;a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/health/mental-health/national-study-mental-health-and-wellbeing/2020-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;one in five Australian men&lt;/a&gt; at some point in their lives. But the condition remains highly stigmatized, misunderstood and underdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Men are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3135672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;around half as likely&lt;/a&gt; to be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder compared to women. Some feel pressure to be fearless and hide their emotions. Others simply don’t understand or have the language to describe anxiety symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This has serious consequences. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725007591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Our latest research&lt;/a&gt; shows young men are turning to ambulance services when their symptoms become overwhelming – some even think they’re having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So why do so many men wait until they need to call emergency services, rather than seek support earlier from a doctor or psychologist? And what prompts them to call? We reviewed the paramedic notes of 694 men aged 15 to 25 years in Victoria, Australia, to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-young-men-haven-t-seen-others-asking-for-help"&gt;Young Men Haven’t Seen Others Asking For Help&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boys are raised to value courage, strength and self-assurance, and to suppress vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When parents encourage boys to “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735809000671?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;face their fears&lt;/a&gt;,” rather than offering emotional comfort and tenderness, anxiety gets positioned in conflict &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/masculinity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with masculinity&lt;/a&gt;. This leads to a disjuncture between the support young men are met with (and come to expect) from others, and the support they may want or need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This also means boys grow up believing their male role models – dads, brothers, grandads, coaches – don’t get anxious, deterring boys and men from seeking help. As a result, anxiety goes undiagnosed and opportunities for early intervention are missed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recently, we have seen positive shifts challenging restrictive masculine stereotypes. This has improved awareness surrounding &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/depression-fathers-children-genetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;men’s depression&lt;/a&gt; – opening up conversations, normalizing help-seeking and leading to the development of &lt;a href="https://headsupguys.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;men’s mental health programs and resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, men’s anxiety remains in the shadows. When anxiety is talked about, it’s not with the same weight or concern as depression. This is despite men’s anxiety having harmful &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15516548/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health impacts&lt;/a&gt; including turning to alcohol and drugs to cope, and increasing the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.longdom.org/open-access-pdfs/gender-differences-in-suicidal-risk-factors-among-individuals-with-mood-disorders-2167-1044-1000218.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;male suicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-anxiety-look-like"&gt;What Does Anxiety Look Like?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When men are encouraged to talk about anxiety, they describe various challenges including repetitive worries, feeling out-of-control and intense physical symptoms. This includes a high heart rate, shortness of breath, body pains, tremors and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/headaches/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;headaches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jack Steele, a prominent Australian personality and one half of the &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/theinspiredunemployed/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Inspired Unemployed&lt;/a&gt;, opened up about his anxiety difficulties on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxAx0kOOAo8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Imperfects Podcast&lt;/a&gt; last year saying:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what anxiety was. I thought I was the opposite of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way I explain it, it’s like […] your whole body just shuts down. My throat starts closing up and my whole body just goes numb. […] It feels like you’re just so alone. You feel like no-one can help you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You genuinely think the world’s ending – like there’s no out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;







&lt;p&gt;These physical symptoms are common in men but can be frequently dismissed rather than recognized as anxiety. Our research has found that, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.13641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;when left unaddressed&lt;/a&gt;, these symptoms typically worsen and arise in more and more contexts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-do-anxious-men-call-ambulances"&gt;Why Do Anxious Men Call Ambulances?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032725007591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Our new study&lt;/a&gt; investigated the consequences of men’s anxiety going unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, we used data from the &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Ambulance Surveillance System&lt;/a&gt; to identify and describe the types of anxiety young men experience. We then looked at the characteristics and contexts of young men’s anxiety presentations to ambulance services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed and lacking support, many young men turn to ambulances in crisis. Anxiety now accounts for &lt;a href="https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/turning-point-website-prod/drupal-s3fs/s3fs-public/inline-files/Beyond%20the%20emergency%20WEB_FINAL_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;10% of male ambulance attendances&lt;/a&gt; for mental health concerns, surpassing depression and psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While every presentation is different, our study identified three common presentations among young men:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Sudden onset of intense bodily symptoms&lt;/strong&gt; resembling life-threatening physical health conditions such as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two-year-old Joshua, for example, whose case files we reviewed as part of our study, was on a tram home from work when he experienced sudden numbness in his hands and feet. A bystander saw he was having muscle spasms in his hands. Joshua was alert but extremely anxious and asked the bystander for help.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Severe anxiety triggered or worsened by substance use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adam, a 21-year-old man, consumed a substantial amount of diazepam (&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/safest-way-to-take-valium-ativan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Valium&lt;/a&gt;) while driving home, after having an anxiety attack at work. Adam reached out to paramedics because he was concerned his anxiety symptoms hadn’t dissipated, and was worried he may have taken too much diazepam.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Mental health deterioration with self-harm or suicidal thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;, often tied to situational stressors such as unstable housing, unemployment, financial difficulties and relationship strain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leo, aged 25, had been increasingly anxious for the past three days. Leo’s parents called an ambulance after he told them he wanted to kill himself. Leo told paramedics on arrival that he still felt suicidal and had been getting worse over the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-directing-resources-where-they-re-needed"&gt;Directing Resources Where They’re Needed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Young men’s anxiety presentations are time- and resource-intensive for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30543663/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;paramedics&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom feel poorly equipped to respond effectively. After ruling out physical causes, paramedic support is typically limited to reassurance and breathing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most young men are then instructed to follow up with GPs, psychologists or other health professionals in the general community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But taking that next step involves overcoming the stigma associated with help-seeking, the shame of having called an ambulance and deep tensions between anxiety and what it means to be a man.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means many young men slip through the cracks. And without ongoing mental health support, they face high risks of presenting again to emergency services with increasingly severe &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/mental-health/"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this, we need to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ramp up conversations about men’s anxiety and take their experiences seriously&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;develop an awareness campaign about men’s anxiety. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l8GOz4a9WA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Awareness campaigns&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/39/4/daae104/7748055?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;successfully&lt;/a&gt; dismantled stigma and shed light on men’s depression and suicide&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;improve diagnosis of men’s anxiety disorders by up-skilling and &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2024-28138-001.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt; clinicians to detect anxiety and the unique and distinct constellations of symptoms in men&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;create accessible pathways to early support through digital psychological education resources, focused on improving awareness and literacy surrounding men’s &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety experiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18009/nutrient-focused-diets/high-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-fiber recipes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 409 to 469 calories while the lunches span 486 to 514 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a modification for 1,200 calories?&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Increasing fiber intake is consistently recommended as a strategy to reduce high &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-help-lower-cholesterol-8399539" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, but does eating more fiber positively impact triglycerides as well? Research indicates that a high fiber intake is associated with lower triglyceride levels in adults with overweight or obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; With its array of positive health implications, aiming to eat more fiber is a strategy that most people can benefit from.

Among these, Aspergillus—a common yet potentially deadly fungus—is gaining new ground. Once confined primarily to warmer regions, this airborne threat is now forecasted to expand its reach into parts of North America, Europe, China, and Russia. A recent study by researchers at the University of Manchester employed advanced climate modeling to predict how Aspergillus will migrate in response to rising temperatures, warning that millions more people may be at risk of infection by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Aspergillus is a familiar organism to scientists and farmers, its ability to cause invasive aspergillosis—a severe lung infection—makes it a serious public health concern. The new findings arrive amid a global rise in fungal infections, which already claim an estimated 2.5 million lives annually. These numbers may be underreported due to the difficulty in diagnosis and the limited global surveillance of fungal diseases. This article explores the science behind Aspergillus, the impact of climate change on its distribution, and the urgent need for enhanced monitoring and medical preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Aspergillus? Understanding the fungus among us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus is a genus of over 300 mold species that thrive in various environments—soil, plant matter, decaying leaves, compost, and even indoor dust. Although many species are harmless and some are even useful in industrial fermentation (like soy sauce or citric acid production), several are pathogenic to humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most concerning are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/strong&gt;: The most common cause of aspergillosis, particularly dangerous for immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/strong&gt;: Known for producing aflatoxins, potent carcinogens that contaminate crops like maize and peanuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/strong&gt;: Common in indoor environments and capable of causing ear infections and respiratory issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fungi reproduce by releasing microscopic spores (conidia) into the air. While healthy individuals can inhale these spores with little consequence, vulnerable populations—including those with asthma, COPD, cancer, organ transplants, or HIV—face a much higher risk of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Aspergillosis explained: The deadly lung infection you’ve probably never heard of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillosis refers to a group of diseases caused by Aspergillus spores that take root in the lungs and sometimes spread to other parts of the body. The most severe form, invasive aspergillosis, can be fatal if not treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Types of Aspergillosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: A hypersensitive reaction often seen in asthma or cystic fibrosis patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: Long-term infection leading to lung cavities and respiratory decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasive aspergillosis&lt;/strong&gt;: A fast-spreading, often deadly condition in immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptoms include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes aspergillosis particularly dangerous is the difficulty in diagnosis. Its symptoms often mimic other respiratory illnesses, delaying appropriate treatment. Moreover, treatment options are limited, with only four primary classes of antifungal drugs available—azole resistance among Aspergillus species is growing, making infections harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How climate change is driving the spread of Aspergillus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Manchester study underscores a chilling reality: as global temperatures climb, so does the habitat range of heat-tolerant fungi. Using a combination of climate simulation models and fungal biology data, researchers evaluated how Aspergillus species will respond to two climate scenarios—moderate emissions and high fossil fuel use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key findings:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspergillus flavus, a heat-loving fungus, is projected to expand its global range by 16% under high-emission scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus, traditionally found in temperate regions, may shift its range northward, with a 77.5% increase in its potential habitat by 2100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This expansion could put 9 million more people in Europe at increased risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooler regions such as northern China, Russia, and parts of Canada could soon become hotspots for fungal colonization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conversely, sub-Saharan Africa, already experiencing extreme temperatures, might become too hot for certain Aspergillus strains, leading to unexpected shifts in ecological balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why heat makes fungi stronger&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi generally struggle to thrive at the high internal temperatures of mammals. However, as average global temperatures rise, fungi are slowly adapting to heat stress. This means they are more likely to survive—and flourish—inside the human body. This heat-hardening process could lead to the emergence of new, more virulent fungal strains capable of overcoming our natural defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to temperature changes, climate-linked weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods play a critical role in dispersing fungal spores. The 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri, for example, led to a rare and deadly fungal outbreak. As these extreme weather events become more frequent, the spread of Aspergillus spores across long distances will likely increase, enhancing their potential to infect new populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Public health implications: Who is at risk?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populations most vulnerable to the threat of Aspergillus expansion include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., cancer, HIV, or transplant patients)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elderly populations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with respiratory conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or COPD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rural populations with increased exposure to airborne spores from agriculture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regions projected to become new habitats for Aspergillus, public health systems may not be adequately prepared to diagnose or treat fungal diseases. There’s an urgent need for greater awareness, improved diagnostic tools, and antifungal research funding to meet this looming threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Medical challenges: Drug resistance and diagnostic gaps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most alarming aspects of the fungal threat is growing antifungal resistance. Azoles, the most commonly used antifungal drugs, are becoming less effective due to overuse in both medicine and agriculture.

A new study shows that juvenile finches prefer tutors who sing longer but less often, suggesting social cues guide their choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers removed the amygdala, a brain region tied to emotion, the young birds still imitated songs, but chose tutors more randomly. This indicates that while the amygdala isn’t essential for song learning itself, it helps young birds selectively choose whom to learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tutor Preference:&lt;/strong&gt; Juvenile finches favor adult tutors who sing longer but less frequently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amygdala Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Removing the amygdala didn’t affect imitation but reduced social selectivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; The amygdala may influence imitative behavior by guiding social attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does a bird learn its birdsong? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomoko Fujii and Masashi Tanaka, from Waseda University, explored what drives a zebra finch to approach and imitate other zebra finches to learn its birdsong in a new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110412"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince.jpg" alt="This shows birds and musical notes." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/amygdala-social-learning-neurosiceince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;To examine the role of the amygdala, the researchers removed it from the young zebra finches. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored song learning in young male zebra finches as they interacted with “tutor” adults that already knew their birdsongs. Young zebra finches preferably approached tutors that sang longer but less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fujii and Tanaka next probed the role of a brain region traditionally linked to emotions in mammals (the amygdala) in this song-learning process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the role of the amygdala, the researchers removed it from the young zebra finches. While loss of this brain region did not hinder song imitation, tutor selection became more unpredictable as birds pursued tutors less discerningly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing neural connections in the zebra finch brain further confirmed that the amygdala doesn’t necessarily drive song control and learning, but may play a role in socially selective, imitative behavior, according to the authors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this social learning and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6a070f0e030b2a190c044405180d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2435-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Amygdala Regulates Social Motivation for Selective Vocal Imitation in Zebra Finches&lt;/a&gt;” by Tomoko Fujii et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amygdala Regulates Social Motivation for Selective Vocal Imitation in Zebra Finches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imitation plays a key role in the acquisition of speech and cultural behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that social interaction facilitates imitative learning, indicating that neural circuits involved in social behaviors can also influence the process of imitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vocal imitation in juvenile songbirds serves as a valuable model to investigate this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we explore the mechanisms of tutor-pupil social interaction and selective song learning in male zebra finches, with a particular focus on the amygdala, which can regulate social behaviors via its processing of values and emotions in mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When sequentially exposed to two tutors, normal pupils selectively learned song from the tutor who sang longer but less frequently. When hearing songs, pupils preferentially approached the selected tutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excitotoxic lesions of the amygdala increased pupils’ social motivation toward tutors yet diminished their song-responsive approach, especially to the selected tutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas the pupils with amygdala lesions retained their ability to imitate song, the tutor selection became more unpredictable with diminished preference for a specific tutor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuronal tracing confirmed that the zebra finch amygdala is connected to the circuits involved in social functions but lacks direct connections to those critical for song control and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that the amygdala regulates social motivation and tutor selection in juvenile zebra finches, highlighting its role in imitative learning.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 12:32:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE1oNDJpVG9hWDJ6TU9mS2x0Rmw0MW8zQkJRU28zbkE5MXJ3ZDNKNjZjMHk3ZVZUU3BremNqTnVJOUJuLWVxMXU2c2hWSFMtNWRhQ0ZLQ1JRbHNJYk96OWkyalZFQ2JKMm1kMFhmcg</guid></item><item><title>睡前性活动改善客观睡眠质量，研究发现- PsyPost | Sexual activity before bed improves objective sleep quality, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPTHJDWGN5SDJyWDQ3eWpuVWUzclY3QU5yTVg4Q3VBWjI1WVpEMW4tMGhhM3JjTEhpdUtUME5rb2R4WG0yM0RDUGt0ZzI1S0JPeVlucWg5MWFmZk1sWGpEeld1NXg2Vml4a1BMR01Vc0cxWVh3TF80YU5mN3VnOFlncDhURHRLZmxPczZGbERFb2ZXRXhOMUszWERXY2M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging in sexual activity—whether solo or with a partner—can lead to better sleep, according to a new pilot study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2024.11.004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sleep Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The research found that both partnered sex and solo masturbation reduced the amount of time people spent awake during the night and improved overall sleep efficiency. These effects were not reflected in subjective reports of sleep quality, but objective sleep monitoring showed consistent improvements following sexual activity compared to nights without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many people believe that orgasm has a relaxing effect and promotes sleep, most existing evidence has relied on subjective reports. Only one study—conducted more than three decades ago—had attempted to objectively measure sleep following sexual activity, and it had significant design limitations. The present research aimed to address this gap by using a portable brain-monitoring device to measure sleep stages and sleep quality in a real-world setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have been investigating sleep behaviors in the adult population for several years, while this has predominantly focused on improving the sleep behaviors of elite athletes, I am always asked various questions about sleep,” said study author Michele Lastella, a senior lecturer at CQUniversity Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A frequent question asked ‘how come my partner falls asleep straight away after sex and I can’t’ and I thought if people are frequently asking me questions about this, then this must be indicative that there is a real lack of research evidence around it. One of the main reasons it hadn’t previously been explored in depth was related to the taboo associated with people being afraid to talk about sex. When people would ask question, a lot of the time it was associated with the males falling asleep and the women weren’t, and I thought this may be something related to the orgasm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is part of a broader research effort investigating the relationship between sex and sleep. Earlier work Lastella and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00033" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;surveyed 778 people and found&lt;/a&gt; that both men and women perceived that sex with orgasm helped them fall asleep faster and sleep better. These findings prompted the current study, which provides a more detailed and objective look at how sexual activity influences sleep physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited seven heterosexual couples, comprising 14 participants in total, all of whom were healthy, sexually active, and living together in South Australia. Participants were screened to ensure they had no sleep disorders, were not pregnant, and did not have children, which could affect sleep routines. All participants reported engaging in sexual activity at least twice a week. The final sample consisted of 7 males and 7 females, each around 26 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were monitored over 11 consecutive nights using a repeated-measures, crossover design. Each couple completed nights in three different conditions: no sexual activity, solo masturbation (with orgasm), and partnered sex (with orgasm). To measure sleep objectively, participants wore a wireless polysomnographic device (DREEM3 headband), which recorded brain activity, movement, and breathing during the night. Participants also completed self-report diaries each morning, detailing their sexual activity, sleep quality, mood, and readiness for the upcoming day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On nights when participants engaged in sexual activity, they went to bed later than on nights with no sex. However, they also spent significantly less time awake after falling asleep and had higher sleep efficiency, meaning they spent a greater proportion of their time in bed actually sleeping. Sleep efficiency was 93.2% following solo masturbation and 93.4% after partnered sex, compared to 91.5% on nights with no sexual activity. Participants spent about 7 minutes less awake during the night following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the improvements in sleep were evident only in the objective data. Participants did not report significant differences in how well they thought they had slept across the three conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We observed that engaging in sexual activity regardless of whether it was solo masturbation or partnered sexual activity, improved objective sleep quality by reducing the amount of time spent awake throughout the night and improved overall sleep efficiency,” Lastella told PsyPost. “There were no differences in sleep duration, sleep latency and subjective sleep measures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, they did report feeling more motivated and ready for the day following partnered sex. On average, participants rated their motivation and readiness 8–11 points higher (on a 100-point scale) after a night of partnered sex compared to nights without sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another aspect the study examined was how sexual activity might influence the synchronization of sleep stages between partners, known as sleep stage concordance. Previous studies have shown that couples who share a bed tend to enter REM sleep at similar times, suggesting that cosleeping can influence sleep patterns. This study found that REM sleep stage concordance was significantly longer when couples slept together—regardless of whether they had engaged in sex—compared to when they slept alone. This suggests that the act of cosleeping itself may promote synchronized REM sleep, potentially due to shared environmental and physiological cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at specific sleep stages, the researchers found that participants spent more time in the lightest stage of sleep (N1) on nights without sexual activity. While the difference—about 2 minutes—was statistically significant, it is unlikely to have clinical significance. Other stages of sleep, including deep sleep (N3) and REM sleep, did not show significant differences across the three conditions, although there were trends suggesting some improvements following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings are in line with previous research. For example, a 2023 study published in the Journal of Sleep Research used a 14-day diary method and found that partnered sex with &lt;a href="https://www.psypost.org/partnered-sexual-activity-with-orgasm-improves-sleep-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;orgasm was associated with shorter time to fall asleep&lt;/a&gt; and better self-reported sleep quality. However, that study did not include objective sleep measures and found inconsistent results for solo masturbation. The current study supports the idea that orgasm, regardless of whether it occurs alone or with a partner, may have sleep-promoting effects—but these effects are more clearly captured through objective measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors suggest that hormonal changes following orgasm could explain the observed benefits to sleep. Orgasm is known to increase the release of oxytocin and prolactin while reducing cortisol levels. Oxytocin, often called the “bonding hormone,” has been linked to lower stress and better sleep, while prolactin is associated with sexual satisfaction and relaxation. These hormonal shifts may reduce arousal and promote a smoother transition into restful sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the study had several limitations. The sample was small, consisting of only 14 participants, all of whom were healthy heterosexual couples. This limits the ability to generalize the findings to broader populations, such as older adults, people with sleep disorders, or those in non-heterosexual relationships. The participants also had to activate their sleep monitoring devices after sexual activity, which may have interfered with the natural transition into sleep and reduced the chance of capturing very short sleep onset latencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the main challenges is setting up the device to record following sexual activity, as in an ideal real world scenario individuals would be able to simply attempt to sleep following sexual activity without having to activate/record on a device,” Lastella noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was the potential for social desirability bias in self-reported measures. While the objective data were less susceptible to this, participants might have felt inclined to rate their sleep or sexual experiences more positively. The researchers note that future studies should aim to include a more diverse and larger sample and should explore whether sexual activity could be used as a behavioral intervention for people with poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are actively seeking funding to support our third part of the investigation recruiting a larger sample with participants with poor sleep quality or behaviours and examine if sexual activity can help subsequent sleep behavior,” Lastella said. “This type of research is important as it provide us with a non-pharmaceutical approach toward improving not only sleep behavior but health and wellbeing as a collective. Please reach out if this research interests you, and there are funding opportunities that might support this type of research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleh.2024.11.004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sleep on it: A pilot study exploring the impact of sexual activity on sleep outcomes in cohabiting couples&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Michele Lastella, Dean J.

But last fall, a breast-cancer narrative of a different ilk briefly claimed headlines: In the span of six weeks, two famous breast-cancer patients shared publicly that they had declined parts of their doctors’ treatment recommendations and chosen alternative approaches instead.&lt;/p&gt;

In a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58bOXgeOnFA"&gt;CNN roundtable discussion&lt;/a&gt;, she said her stage-three breast cancer diagnosed in January 2019 had progressed to stage four, which meant it was now incurable. Lewis said she had declined a double mastectomy and chemotherapy and had opted instead for lifestyle changes like detoxes and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in combination with high-dose vitamin C IVs — at least at first. “I decided to keep my tumor and try to work it out of my body a different way,” she said to CNN correspondent Stephanie Elam. The other was model Elle Macpherson. In a September interview with an &lt;a href="https://www.womensweekly.com.au/news/elle-macpherson-now/"&gt;Australian women’s magazine&lt;/a&gt;, she said she’d been diagnosed with stage-zero breast cancer and was now in remission. Though she had a lumpectomy, she &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/elle-macpherson-breast-cancer-treatment.html"&gt;refused additional therapies&lt;/a&gt;, including chemotherapy and radiation, that her doctors recommended. “I chose a holistic approach,” she wrote in her memoir, &lt;em&gt;elle&lt;/em&gt;, published in November. “Saying no to standard medical solutions was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life. But saying no to my own inner sense would have been even harder.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9m8000n3b6dfqjbmmz5@published" data-word-count="204"&gt;Scientific advancements in breast-cancer treatment occur with remarkable regularity. From 2010 to 2020, the FDA approved 30 medications for breast cancer, and in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2813878"&gt;a 2024 &lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on breast-cancer mortality, the authors estimate that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a new trial in breast cancer is added to ClinicalTrials.gov every day. These developments have saved at least half a million lives. From 1989 to 2022, the breast-cancer death rate &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21863"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; by 44 percent. Currently, the overall five-year &lt;a href="https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-facts/"&gt;survival rate&lt;/a&gt; for breast cancer is 91 percent, and those diagnosed with the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5833304/"&gt;most severe form&lt;/a&gt; of the disease are living longer than ever before. And yet, despite all of this, not every breast-cancer patient opts for the most effective treatment modalities. This may be because breast-cancer care has become more varied and multipronged at a time when information — and misinformation — has never been more accessible, and when distrust in physicians is rapidly increasing, especially among Republicans. Thirty-four percent of them told &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2022/02/15/americans-trust-in-scientists-other-groups-declines/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; in the winter of 2022 they had “not too much” or “no confidence at all” that medical scientists were working toward the public’s best interests. That figure has tripled since January 2019. In other words: Why trust a doctor when you can fact-check them instead?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mz000w3b6dmg9rc325@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;“People can come to these conversations with preconceived notions about the effectiveness of these treatments and whether they should do them,” said Dr. &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/find-a-doctor/skyler-b-johnson"&gt;Skyler Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist at the University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute. “I get the sense that they feel like they know more than me, that I’m more of an enemy than a counterpart trying to help.” Some, particularly those interested in natural healing methods, are wary of conventional therapies — especially chemotherapy and radiation — and their brutal reputation. (There is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29237009/"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/15/cancer-radiation-therapy-decreased-use/"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that use of both therapies is declining, though chemotherapy is still &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/treatment/breast_cancer"&gt;used&lt;/a&gt; in more than half of breast-cancer patients whose disease has spread to the lymph nodes.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mn000q3b6dqebzbaos@published" data-word-count="120"&gt;For more than ten years, Johnson has &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/alternative-medicine-cancer-survival"&gt;studied&lt;/a&gt; people who forgo conventional cancer treatments in favor of unproven treatments. In one of his studies, the breast-cancer patients who made such a decision had a 470 percent increased risk of death in the following five years. He’s hesitant, at first, to say what’s changed in the decade since he began this line of research; social media was around a decade ago, after all. “But I can tell you that the patient behavior has changed,” he said, referring to worsening distrust in doctors and in the health-care system at large. “And I think it’s changed in a way that is likely going to lead to the adoption of more unproven cancer treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

In 2017, about 20 percent told &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2017/02/02/americans-health-care-behaviors-and-use-of-conventional-and-alternative-medicine/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; that they’d turned to alternative methods instead of conventional medical care. The practice is especially popular in cancer care. An estimated 50 percent of cancer patients use alternative medicine in addition to conventional treatment. It’s harder to pinpoint how many people may be using alternative care &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of standard care, in part because these patients may not be in contact with the health-care system. But, anecdotally, stories about celebrities choosing this route seems to have an impact on the larger patient population. &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mel-gibson-joe-rogan-ivermectin-fenbendazole-cancer-podcast-2013180"&gt;In January,&lt;/a&gt; Mel Gibson went on Joe Rogan’s podcast and said three of his friends had been cured of their stage-four cancers after taking ivermectin and fenbendazole (an anti-parasitic). Since then, Johnson said, “This is not an exaggeration: I am fielding a question about ivermectin currently once a week.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mt000v3b6diabxhn41@published" data-word-count="72"&gt;Personal stories and recommendations wield power too. When Amber Jones, who is in her early 40s and lives in Atlanta, was diagnosed with breast cancer, a friend told her to look up Josh Axe, a practitioner of natural medicine and chiropractic. Axe &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJJ_Q0luTaT/"&gt;often shares&lt;/a&gt; his mother’s cancer-recovery story, which he attributes to natural healing methods. “He’s the reason,” Jones said. “He’s the reason I had the courage to do what I did.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9s8001w3b6dmmyzjm7j@published" data-word-count="67"&gt;In 2022, when she was 38, she had an abnormal Pap smear that turned out to be cervical cancer. Her doctors recommended a radical &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/why-lena-dunhams-hysterectomy-is-unusual.html"&gt;hysterectomy&lt;/a&gt;, which would remove nearly all of her reproductive organs (her surgeon would leave one ovary, so as not to send her into early menopause) as well as the surrounding tissue. She was terrified of the diagnosis and complied without a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9nn001e3b6dsef7uo68@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;The surgery was a success: Follow-up tests showed no sign of cancer. But it left her reeling. Recovery was difficult, and it took her six months to feel physically functional again. The emotional impact lingered even longer. “You hear the word cancer the first time, and you think, &lt;em&gt;I’m going to die&lt;/em&gt;,” she said. Within a day of her diagnosis, she started organizing her finances, going so far as to make her teenage daughter the beneficiary of her bank account. “It was just really, really emotionally traumatizing,” she said. “And that feeling didn’t go away.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ms000t3b6dy93lst0s@published" data-word-count="95"&gt;She decided to make some lifestyle changes. She made her own deodorant and planted an organic garden in her backyard. (It has required getting creative when it comes to controlling bugs: “There’s some particular bugs that you just have to hand-pick off,” she said.) She began to drink reverse-osmosis-filtered water, eat grass-fed meats from regeneratively raised farms, and take methylated vitamins. “I fired my cleaning people and was like, &lt;em&gt;I’m doing this myself, old school — baking soda, vinegar&lt;/em&gt;,” she said. “I stopped &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-to-dye-your-hair.html"&gt;dyeing my hair&lt;/a&gt; and going to salons. I stopped doing my nails.”&lt;/p&gt;

She had triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive form of the disease that grows and spreads more quickly than other types. She was 40 years old now, with a husband and two teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9ml000p3b6di5wyducz@published" data-word-count="109"&gt;The cancer was stage one, which meant it was still &lt;a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/triple-negative-breast-cancer-5-things-you-should-know.h00-158986656.html"&gt;curable&lt;/a&gt;, and her medical team recommended surgery to remove the tumor, plus chemotherapy and radiation to lessen the chance of recurrence. But Jones didn’t want to do any of that. She’d just worked so hard to build her body back up after the hysterectomy. To her, the thought of another surgery, plus chemo and radiation, meant potentially undoing it all. “I just believed boosting my body and my immune system would serve me better,” she said. She expressed her hesitancy toward the suggested treatments at her first appointment with her medical oncologist, who was alarmed. But Jones dug in.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n200123b6d0kg81dck@published" data-word-count="58"&gt;“Because that was the mistake I made with my first cancer,” she said. “I probably should have fought a little bit harder for myself and not done what I was told to.” Soon after her second diagnosis, Jones began to follow a few alternative-wellness influencers, including Axe and &lt;a href="https://www.chrisbeatcancer.com/about/"&gt;Chris Wark&lt;/a&gt;, who declined chemotherapy after surgery for stage-3C colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

Afterward, her pathology report showed no sign of disease. “There was not one cancer cell,” she said. “Everything was clear.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9q7001q3b6d0cgi0k8e@published" data-word-count="47"&gt;A week later, Jones again met with her oncologist via telehealth and expressed her relief at the outcome, assuming it would mean no need for chemotherapy and radiation. Actually, her oncologist said, she did still need both to reduce the risk of recurrence. Jones couldn’t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9mq000s3b6dtjgucu10@published" data-word-count="92"&gt;“I was like, &lt;em&gt;Excuse me? Are you crazy?&lt;/em&gt;” she said. “Like, why are you going to blast my body and destroy my immune system?” If the cancer did return — and at the time, Jones was confident that it wouldn’t — she reasoned that she would need a healthy immune system to fight it. Chemotherapy can be &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/managing-life/immune-system/cancer-treatments/chemotherapy"&gt;especially destructive&lt;/a&gt; to white blood cells, which can make patients more vulnerable to disease and infection. “Why would you subject me to that if I don’t need it? How do you know I need it?”&lt;/p&gt;

That appointment was last summer, and she hasn’t seen her oncologist since.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But it is still &lt;a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/chemotherapy/when-is-it-needed"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for those with breast cancer that is at a higher risk of recurring or spreading. Side effects are common, though their severity &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/managing-cancer/treatment-types/chemotherapy/chemotherapy-side-effects.html"&gt;varies&lt;/a&gt; from person to person. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10226821/#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%2097.4%20%25%20(,%25%20(n=25)."&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that 97 percent of patients reported at least one side effect; fatigue was most commonly reported, followed by loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and difficulty breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

At first, Reandeau stayed on the treatment course recommended by her doctor, even though it was rough. “We did numerous different types of chemotherapy, because I kept having allergic reactions,” she said. “I would get the chemo, and then I would have reactions to it, and then they would have to pump me full of steroids to stop the reactions from happening.”&lt;/p&gt;

Every day, she consumed soursop tea, apricot kernels, turkey-tail mushroom tablets, and muscadine-juice concentrate to treat her cancer, even though her medical team had told her not to take supplements because they could worsen the side effects or weaken the efficacy of the chemo. (Johnson estimates that one in three patients who use unproven treatments don’t inform their medical team.) “They say you can eat and drink and do whatever you want, but don’t take any supplements,” she said. “Like, you can eat hot dogs, hamburgers, you can have as much ice cream as you want. But don’t take soursop. And I’m like, &lt;em&gt;Well, that doesn’t really seem to make a lot of sense&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;

Like usual, her mom took her home afterward, where Reandeau lived alone. “And everything seemed normal,” she said. “And then about a week went by, and I don’t remember pretty much the entire week.”&lt;/p&gt;

Once, she woke up in the bathroom at two or three in the morning, with no memory of how she got there, and found herself surrounded by her own vomit and feces. Her sister took her back to the oncologist, who said she was neutropenic. She was too out of it to know what drugs she received as treatment (“steroids and liquids and all different kinds of medication”), but within a few hours, she was feeling better. Her doctors suggested lessening the chemotherapy dosage, but she had already made up her mind. She would have surgery and rounds of radiation, but she was steadfast in her chemo decision.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n200133b6d74ulaidz@published" data-word-count="108"&gt;Citrin spent much of his career treating breast-cancer patients at a for-profit hospital chain outside of Chicago called Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Eventually, the hospital was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/12/08/city-of-hope-to-buy-cancer-treatment-centers-of-america/"&gt;bought by another system&lt;/a&gt;, but at the time, Citrin said, it advertised a holistic approach as part of its marketing. “It was really just simply a marketing ploy, because I’m a very conventional, conservative medical oncologist. We used surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and all appropriate treatments,” he said. “But this was the hook that institution used to get people in.” (The chain faced accusations of misleading marketing claims and &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/1996/03/companies-purport-successfully-treat-cancer-agree-settle-ftc-charges-over-their-claims#:~:text=Cancer%20Treatment%20Centers%20of%20America,%2C%20based%20in%20Tulsa%2C%20Oklahoma."&gt;reached a settlement&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Trade Commission over those allegations in 1996.)&lt;/p&gt;

I mean, you can’t imagine what her breast would look like.” He has seen women whose tumors grew so large they broke through the skin. One woman hid her breast cancer from her husband as long as she could, until neither of them could ignore the smell. “Her breast literally fell off in the shower, it was so diseased,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n0000z3b6dyiib3szh@published" data-word-count="106"&gt;In 2012, he published a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3360900/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; for which he interviewed 60 breast-cancer patients who had chosen alternative treatment instead of conventional therapies. The research was an attempt to identify what motivated these patients, inspired by the horrors he’d seen in his clinical practice. Many of these women told him they’d had bad experiences with “uncaring, insensitive, and unnecessarily harsh” oncologists who dismissed their wishes to incorporate alternative medicine into their treatment protocols or became combative when they asked questions. One woman reported feeling even more alienated when her doctor tried to scare her into conventional treatment, telling her, “You’ll never live to see your grandchildren born.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmb11c9n400143b6d66jisk9f@published" data-word-count="128"&gt;Others said they were afraid of side effects. Very few of them declined surgery, some refused radiation, and many declined chemotherapy and hormone therapy. Almost as many also refused postsurgical treatment, called adjuvant therapy, which uses a variety of treatment modalities (such as chemotherapy and radiation) and is meant to kill off even microscopic cancer cells to lower the risk of recurrence. The side effects can make adjuvant therapy a hard sell, especially after a test comes back after surgery showing no sign of cancer. In one study, an &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2017/breast-cancer-patients-forego-post-surgery-treatment-due-to-mistrust-study-suggests"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; one-third of breast-cancer patient-study participants either quit or never started their prescribed adjuvant therapy. The study also noted that patients who are more distrustful of medical institutions are even more likely to stop treatment or fail to start.&lt;/p&gt;

So then, “&lt;em&gt;Why do I have to do this? The surgeon told me he got it all!&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

Jones’s oncologist told her that with the recommended adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation, her chance of the cancer returning would be 5 to 10 percent. Without the treatment, she estimated Jones’s chance of recurrence at 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s certainly not the choice her oncologist wanted her to make. But medicine in the U.S. is based on shared decision-making between patients and physicians. “It’s our job to give our best possible medical advice and the reason behind that medical advice,” said &lt;a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/jennifer_litton.html"&gt;Dr. Jennifer Litton,&lt;/a&gt; a breast cancer oncologist at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas. “But then it’s absolutely that person’s right to decide what’s best for them.”&lt;/p&gt;

Recently, Swire-Thompson collaborated with Johnson to study online claims about unproven cancer treatments and what could be done to correct them. One thing that seems to work is highlighting low expertise; pointing out, in other words, that this person doesn’t have the credentials to be sharing this information. But Swire-Thompson noted that it’s hard to beat someone’s personal story, in part because it’s difficult to identify what to correct. “When people hear an anecdote that matches some of their preconceived ideas, it’s really easy to believe in that story,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

In April, she received an email notifying her that she’d lost her federal funding because her project was attempting to sway public opinion. “Unlike with other misinformation topics, I don’t think there’s much nuance here,” said Swire-Thompson, who has studied misinformation and what makes people update their beliefs since 2009. “I thought there’d be at least bipartisan agreement that cancer is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;

Today, patients will often have arrived in their physicians’ office having thoroughly researched their condition and the most cutting-edge treatments. The authors suggest physicians may need to reconceptualize their role as “consultants or advisors to patients who will increasingly direct their own care.”&lt;/p&gt;

It’s an approach that, he thinks, has helped nudge reluctant patients to consent to conventional cancer treatments. “In my experience, if a doctor takes the time to explain this to the patient in simple terms, most patients stick with it,” he said. “But unfortunately, in the current climate, doctors’ time is limited for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

He has told those who are interested in alternative-care treatments: &lt;em&gt;Try it. But keep in touch, and let’s test again in a few months. &lt;/em&gt;“Unfortunately, physicians will often wash their hands of these people and say, &lt;em&gt;Good luck&lt;/em&gt;,” he said. “And that’s kind of the end of it.” He likes to leave the door open, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

Although she eventually received a type of alternative chemotherapy called insulin potentiation therapy, which Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center says is unproven, she stands by her surgery choice. “On some level, it would have been easier to get rid of the tumor,” she said over the phone. But a double mastectomy would have put her in a body she didn’t want to be in. “I would rather live a shorter life as me than a longer one as someone I don’t recognize,” she added. Recently, Lewis has been on conventional treatments for stage-four cancer — an oral hormone therapy called anastrozole and an injection called fulvestrant — and has received targeted radiation on her spine for pain management. She says she’s in pain right now, but she believes that’s because her body is healing. In March, Macpherson &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/elle-macpherson-on-her-celebration-phase/id1585499926?i=1000700888878"&gt;told Hoda Kotb&lt;/a&gt; that she was in clinical remission.&lt;/p&gt;

When we spoke in March, Jones had been dodging calls from her oncologist, who was trying to schedule an imaging appointment. She’s wary of the radiation, as well as the compression. (“I don’t want to radiate and squish the hell out of damaged tissue,” she said.) She’s also very worried that her cancer has spread, and that imaging only her breasts would miss that. “She keeps following up with me … to do a mammogram,” Jones said of her doctor. “And it’s like, well, what about the rest of my body?”&lt;/p&gt;

She understands that the test doesn’t replace breast imaging. “But I figured it’s better than nothing,” she said. She knows her cancer might come back, and that if it does, her prognosis will be worse. And so she has decided that, in the end, she’d rather not know if that’s the case.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m putting in all the effort and investing in my body, you know? If it comes back, it comes back.”&lt;/p&gt;

Choosing a top-quality midday meal can be the difference between going strong until quitting time vs. crashing at your desk at 3 p.m. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you want to get it right, nutritionists have smart strategies for the best lunch possible. “Lunch is more than just a break in the day — it’s a biological checkpoint,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pritikin.com/martha-theran" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Martha Theran" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682e09dae4b0c2f07d8c77b4" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.pritikin.com/martha-theran" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Martha Theran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) at Pritikin Longevity Center. “It’s when you can stabilize blood sugar, reset your mental clarity and set the tone for how you’ll feel through the evening.

Choose a grain base like quinoa, wild rice, millet or farro. Add protein like shrimp, beans, tofu, salmon or lentils. Choose a dairy topper like cheese, and don’t forget to add frozen, fresh or roasted vegetables. You can also add other toppings such as avocado.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crumbled tofu taco lettuce wraps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (Toby Smithson): “Serve them with a side of non-starchy vegetables like steamed green beans, and an apple, which is a quality carbohydrate, along with some with nuts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bento box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; (Amy Goodson): “Use a six-compartment box to build your lunch with fruit, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, dairy and a healthy-fat dip.” Goodson loves a Mediterranean box of grapes, cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, quinoa, chicken, mini mozzarella balls and hummus. For a Tex-Mex box, she uses pineapple chunks, bell pepper strips, brown rice, shredded chicken, black beans, shredded cheddar and guacamole.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leftovers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Rebecca Russell):&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;span&gt;One of my favorite lunch strategies is repurposing dinner leftovers.

He serves with the RWJBarnabas Health Medical Group and specializes in sports medicine, frequently identifying ways to strengthen the body. “The amount of mineral content in our bones helps them maintain their strength and resistance to fractures. Maintaining bone density is an incredibly important preventative for reducing the risk of conditions like osteoporosis or fractures. This is especially true as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also risk factors for certain groups, according to &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/news/expert/kai-yu-ho" target="_blank" role="link" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kai-Yu Ho" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.unlv.edu/news/expert/kai-yu-ho" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Kai-Yu Ho&lt;/a&gt;, a physical therapist and professor of physical therapy at University of Nevada in Las Vegas. Ho said bone density is important to look after “especially in postmenopausal women, as estrogen loss speeds up bone weakening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, if you’re concerned about your bone density, how can exercise help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise is a &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" target="_blank" role="link" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="critical component to bone health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;critical component to bone health&lt;/a&gt;,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/deborah-sellmeyer?tab=bio" role="link" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Deborah Sellmeyer" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://profiles.stanford.edu/deborah-sellmeyer?tab=bio" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;Dr. Deborah Sellmeyer&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor of medicine in endocrinology, gerontology and metabolism at Stanford University. “&lt;a href="https://www.bonehealthandosteoporosis.org/patients/treatment/exercisesafe-movement/" target="_blank" role="link" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Impact exercises and weight training" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.bonehealthandosteoporosis.org/patients/treatment/exercisesafe-movement/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Impact exercises and weight training&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to increase bone density. Exercise regimens that incorporate balance training have been shown to reduce falls. Improved bone density and reduced falls help reduce fracture risk.” According to Ho and Longobardi, resistance and weight training increase bone density because they put stress on your bones and muscles, which promotes stronger bone growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sellmeyer advised that we all include three components in our exercise for bone health: 30 minutes of daily impact exercise, 15 to 20 minutes of weights and resistance training a few times a week and daily balance training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can make these changes in your fitness routine without spending a ton of money or taking on daunting new machines or at the gym. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bodyweight exercises and free weights can be just as effective, without the need for a gym membership or expensive equipment,” Longobardi said. Regardless of your approach, he added, “it is important to consult a physician before beginning an exercise program and be aware of your limits to ensure that you can maximize bone-strengthening benefits while reducing the risk of potential strain or injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been looking after your bone health, now’s the time: Based on the experts’ advice, we rounded up some small and easy fitness items you can use to help improve your bone density and reduce your risk of fractures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The experts consulted for this story do not necessarily endorse the products ahead unless otherwise noted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli cli-listicle listicleCountUp"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A set of resistance bands with different resistance levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt; All three experts we spoke to recommended resistance bands as one of the most effective pieces of exercise equipment that can help increase bone density through resistance training.

"It's important to begin with lighter resistance, gradually increasing in intensity to prevent injuries," Longobardi said, advice that Ho echoed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bands are made with a durable, elastic fabric that comes in a bunch of colors. You can use the bands for squats, lunges and other exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt; "These are high quality resistance bands. They have a slight texture to them which holds them in place while using them. Purchased after recommended by my physical therapist.

The vest is also equipped with reflective strips for visibility and a pocket to hold your keys, phone and other essentials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt; "My workout program includes a daily walk/run. I have osteoporosis in my spine and I’d been looking for a weight vest to wear during my walks to possibly help rebuild bone density. I really like this vest because the straps are adjustable; there’re pockets in the front to hold keys, tissue, etc.; it doesn’t ride up or rub when I’m running; and the weights are easy to add and remove. The vest had a noticeable chemical smell when I first took it out the box, but the smell quickly dissipated after the vest sat out a couple days.

That's in addition to other uses around the house, like as a knee pad for gardening, a foot pad for underneath your desk and more. Talk about versatility. The pad is available in five colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising review:&lt;/strong&gt; "Functions exactly as advertised. great for balance and core work. this pad has the perfect amount of "give" to work those areas. also the small waves on the surface help to prevent sliding on hard wood floors." — &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DARAQTF1M6D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="null" data-aps-asc-tag="null" data-aps-asc-subtag="null" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Mary S." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DARAQTF1M6D5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="28"&gt;Mary S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item-container wrapped " data-vars-affiliate="Amazon"&gt;&lt;div class="listicle-item image"&gt;&lt;p class="title-container"&gt;A pair of adjustable dumbbells for weight training&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caption-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Ho and Longobardi named adjustable dumbbells as a beneficial equipment option for resistance training. Why adjustable? "While free weights and resistance bands can help stimulate bone growth, it's important to begin with lighter resistance, gradually increasing in intensity to prevent injuries," Longobardi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ho added that adjustable equipment is more suitable for long-term use as you slowly up the intensity of your workouts. In other words, adjustable dumbbells involve taking on a higher cost upfront, but you'll save money later by not having to purchase new dumbbells so soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our pick is &lt;a href="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/Lifepro-Adjustable-Dumbbell-Dumbbells-Dumbell/dp/B08QTGV9BW?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" target="_blank" role="link" data-amazon-link="true" data-aps-asin="B08QTGV9BW" data-aps-asc-tag="erica-kam-20" data-aps-asc-subtag="6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a,-1,-1,d,0,0,hp-fil-am=0,0:0,0,0,0" rel="sponsored" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="this set from Lifepro" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://r.bttn.io?btn_ref=org-677cb81987ed72f9&amp;amp;btn_url=https://www.amazon.com/Lifepro-Adjustable-Dumbbell-Dumbbells-Dumbell/dp/B08QTGV9BW?tag=erica-kam-20%26ascsubtag%3D6824b3f9e4b021b5064a938a%252C-1%252C-1%252Cd%252C0%252C0%252Chp-fil-am%253D0%252C0%253A0%252C0%252C0%252C0" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="" data-vars-position-in-subunit="24"&gt;this set from Lifepro&lt;/a&gt;, which comes in three weight ranges.

        &lt;p&gt;Typically, the goal of ALS treatments is to slow the disease or halt progression. But new data from the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) jacifusen for FUS-ALS show that two patients went beyond the expected, and showed improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When testing new drugs for ALS, we do not expect to see clinical improvement,” said Neil Shneider, MD, PhD, director of the Eleanor and Lou Gehrig ALS Center and associate professor of motor neuron disorders at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. “What we’ve seen in one patient is really unprecedented functional recovery. It’s surprising and deeply motivating for us, the ALS research community, but also the community of ALS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_2" data-render-ad="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from 12 patients—all treated with the novel therapy for a rare form of ALS caused by a genetic mutation in a gene called FUS—were presented in a case series. This work is published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; in the paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00513-6/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Antisense oligonucleotide jacifusen for FUS-ALS: an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label case series&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants of fused in sarcoma (FUS) cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FUS-ALS), with evidence of gain of function. Jacifusen is an antisense oligonucleotide targeting FUS pre-mRNA. The ASO has previously been shown to delay neurodegeneration in a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though these gene mutations are responsible for only 1% to 2% of ALS cases, they cause some of the most aggressive forms of ALS that begin in adolescents and young adults. In patients with these mutations, toxic FUS proteins accumulate in the motor neurons that control the patient’s muscles, eventually killing the neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_3" data-render-ad="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the patients showed a remarkable response to the experimental therapy, ulefnersen (previously known as jacifusen), which was developed by Shneider in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One young woman, who has received injections of the therapy since late 2020, recovered the ability to walk unaided and to breathe without the use of a ventilator, both previously lost to ALS. She has lived longer with this disease than any other known patient with this juvenile-onset form of FUS-ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second patient, a man in his mid-30s, was asymptomatic when he began treatment, but tests of electrical activity in his muscles indicated that symptoms would likely emerge soon. In three years of continuous treatment with the experimental drug, the man has yet to develop any symptoms of FUS-ALS and the abnormal electrical activity in his muscles has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, after six months of treatment, patients in the series experienced up to an 83% decrease in a protein called neurofilament light, a biomarker of nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These responses show that if we intervene early enough and go after the right target at the right time in the course of disease, it’s possible to not only slow disease progression, but actually reverse some of the functional losses,” Shneider said. “It’s also a wonderful example of precision medicine and therapeutic development based on science and an understanding of the biology of disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though most of the other symptomatic patients in the series did not survive their aggressive disease, Shneider said, “several apparently benefited from the treatment. The progression of their disease slowed, and they lived a longer life as a consequence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="mb-12"&gt;&lt;span id="malgam_render_4" data-render-ad="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing results from the first of these patients, Ionis Pharmaceuticals committed to sponsoring a global clinical trial of the drug, led by Shneider, which is now in progress. “Now we are eagerly awaiting those results, which we hope will lead to the approval of ulefnersen,” Shneider said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of ulefnersen began as an effort to help a single patient. Shneider first tested the therapy six years ago in a patient from Iowa, Jaci Hermstad, whose identical twin had died from the disease years earlier. He had good reason to believe the drug might work. Just a few years earlier, his research in mice revealed that the FUS mutations cause cells to make proteins that are toxic to motor neurons. The results suggested that reducing levels of toxic FUS proteins could prevent or delay onset and progression of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulefnersen was designed to silence the FUS gene and reduce production of toxic and normal FUS proteins. “Because we also found that mature neurons tolerate a reduction of normal FUS protein, our studies provided the rationale for treating FUS-ALS patients with this drug,” Shneider said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, Shneider requested permission from the FDA to administer ulefnersen to Jaci. Since then, at least 25 patients have been treated with ulefnersen (originally named jacifusen for Jaci Hermstad) around the world in expanded access programs.&lt;/p&gt;

But can the city afford to make a big splash in renovating the aging infrastructure, or will a few patches keep things afloat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_11838757" class="wp-caption alignright size-article_inline_half"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-3.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="An open-air building with an arched ceiling, overlooking a pool, with a lifeguard in the distance." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-3.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="11838757" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-3.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-3.jpg?fit=310%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 310w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The city of West St. Paul's community pool at 92 W. Orme St. (Molly Guthrey / Pioneer Press)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The West St. Paul pool &lt;a href="https://wspmn.gov/763/Pool" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;opens for the season&lt;/a&gt; on May 31, but the waterslide has been closed indefinitely due to safety concerns. The move comes after city officials began reviewing the future of the aging community pool, which was originally constructed in 1956 and last underwent a major renovation in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deeper swimming pool was built seven decades ago, while the splash pool came later at the turn of the century. The pool house itself is structurally sound, city staff found, but the original pool and newer splash pool have aging infrastructure and mechanical items that need repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last summer, the city &lt;a href="https://wspmn.gov/995/Pool-Study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;asked residents and pool-goers&lt;/a&gt; their thoughts about keeping the pool open, closing it, and also potential amenities they would like to see at an aquatic area. Results came back heavily in favor of both keeping and renovating the pool, with 95 percent of the 400 respondents favoring either renovating or replacing the pool, compared to closing it down or moving to a new site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We really enjoy it. It has an old-fashioned feel to it,” said Stephanie Schempp of West St. Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She goes to the pool nearly every day with her two sons. When Schempp first heard that the pool’s future might be in jeopardy, she emailed her city council members to advocate for the pool, calling it a “third place” for community members, a place other than home or work where residents can come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It reminds me of my own childhood in the ’80s and ’90s; I love that my kids have a place like this that we can go to,” Schempp said. “We don’t want to lose what we have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Two paths&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_11838723" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-01-e1748272976305.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="An outdoor pool." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-01-e1748272976305.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="11838723" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-01-e1748272976305.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-01-e1748272976305.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-01-e1748272976305.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-01-e1748272976305.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-01-e1748272976305.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The West St. Paul's community pool at 92 W. Orme St. (Molly Guthrey / Pioneer Press)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagnosing the slide’s safety came within the framework of a larger discussion – should the city continue to make smaller, piecemeal repairs, while the overall site still needs larger renovations?&lt;/p&gt;				
&lt;p&gt;“We could do another Band Aid fix, but is that the best way to go about this? Probably not,” said Eric Weiss, West St. Paul parks, recreation, environment and sustainability director. “We said, ‘Let’s take a pause on smaller projects for now.’ We want to balance our investments in the pool, and we want to make sure they are smart moves, and ensure that we are good stewards of our pretty limited resources. It’s a small but mighty place, and people cherish it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of renovating the slide as an example, Weiss said, the city didn’t want to spend upward of $150,000 only to realize that the concrete under the structure would also need to be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, the city council reviewed the state of the pool at a work session, finding two potential paths in renovating the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, a 25-year renovation solution that would cost roughly $1.3 million, would replace smaller items and keep the footprint of the site largely intact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option was a large-scale, 50-year renovation solution that would cost just above an estimated $4 million. That could include pool decking, equipment, the vessels for the deeper pool and the splash pool, as well as flexibility to potentially change the site layout and design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What’s next&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_11838759" class="wp-caption aligncenter size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-2.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="A bucket of pool noodles." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-2.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="11838759" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-2.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-2.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-2.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-2.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://i0.wp.com/www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/STP-L-WSPPOOL-0527-2.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The city of West St. Paul's community pool at 92 W. Orme St. (Molly Guthrey / Pioneer Press)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens next regarding those planning discussions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;City staff are currently in the budgeting season, reviewing how these options could fit into the larger context of the West St. Paul city budget and capital improvement plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone agrees that we want to keep it, and we want to make it happen, but how do we do it?” Weiss said. “We’re in a situation where we want to look at all of those options, and there is some thought — pun intended — if we’re going to do it we want to make a splash, we don’t want to just work around the edges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While February’s council work session brought all options to the table – things like relocating the pool, closing the pool and redistributing smaller aquatic facilities throughout the community, or closing the pool and not adding other swimming options — the council chose to direct staff to first study the two renovation plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West St. Paul Mayor Dave Napier, who recalls swimming in the pool himself as a young child, said the desire to keep the pool exists, but city officials will need to be creative in finding ways to provide funding for what would be a costly renovation project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could an eventual tax referendum go to the voters? Napier said it could be an option, reasoning that the community would have a chance to decide the pool’s eventual fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are a lot of challenges to our budget. It’s not like we have a bunch of money sitting around to fix the pool,” Napier said. “The good news is, we are opening the pool this year. The bad news is, the slide is closed. We really believe in it and want to keep it. I believe we will get there, but we need to be creative on how to fund it, and how we make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Because once it’s gone, it’s gone,” Napier said.&lt;/p&gt;

I did kind of live in a fast-paced, multitasking sort of way. I'm in recovery and I'm a single parent working full-time. I have ADHD as well. So I was stressed, needless to say, and so any of the [memory lapses] that were happening at that time, I chalked up to &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/many-women-blindsided-perimenopause-5-000632546.html" data-ylk="slk:perimenopause;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I've been in my job for a few years. When I opened the computer [one morning] and looked at it, I didn't know what to do. I didn't know where to start. Normally, you would start your job and you'd be like, "Oh, I’ve got to do this, this, this." I had no idea. There was just … nothingness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Two things happened [next] that were obviously [signs that] something was going on. I was boiling an egg. I left it on the stove, and then I walked downtown, which is a half-hour walk. When I got downtown, I realized I left the stove on. I ran home, and my house was covered in smoke. So, it literally almost caught my house on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;[Another time] I was in the gym. I finished my workout and went out to my car. I'm never somebody who loses their keys. I get in my car. I'm looking for my keys. I'm looking through my bag. I can't find it. I'm looking under the seats. I'm like, "This is weird." And then I went to the back seat and looked on the top of the car because sometimes I'll have a coffee and put it on top of my car. It wasn't there. I looked under the car. Not there. I was like, "OK, this is ridiculous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I did a whole swoop again — inside, outside, in the back seat — and then I sat down and I just paused for a minute. And then I heard the car. The car was on, and the keys were in the ignition. My car was on that whole time. I had completely blanked out the process of getting in, putting the key in and turning the ignition on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="getting-diagnosed-and-being-in-denial"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting diagnosed and being in denial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I've struggled with mental health and had a psychiatrist at the time. She did some cognitive tests, and I was failing them. About nine months ago, I saw the neurologist for the first time. He did the two-hour [cognitive test]. I failed that one. Then he looked at my MRIs, looked at other things noted by the psychiatrist, and he just walked in with pamphlets of early-onset Alzheimer's. There was no diagnosis at that time. This was his suspicion. [Further testing, including her &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158220301479" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:medial temporal atrophy (MTA);elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;medial temporal atrophy (MTA)&lt;/a&gt; score, which is a diagnostic tool for dementia, led to a diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer’s.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I have two children. My older daughter, she's a planner. So, her first response was like, "OK, well, do I need to buy a house that can accommodate you and I'm going to take care of you?" And then my younger daughter, it's almost like it's not new to her because she's watched me this whole time. But she just told me recently that she's in denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My mom didn't believe me either, and so about two months ago, I sent her one of the [doctor’s] clinical notes where he's put Alzheimer's on it. And she lost it then because I think she wasn't believing it until she saw it on a piece of paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s so weird. I make fun of it all the time because that's just generally who I am. I like to keep things kind of light and funny. It's important for me to make fun of myself, to keep the morale high for the people around me, but I also need it because it is so serious. I could totally take this and just go on an isolation/depression bender, and I do not want to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="going-viral-on-social-media"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going viral on social media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I was looking everywhere for resources. My partner and I felt really alone because our family was in denial, and so we didn't feel like we could talk to anyone. There were only a few people [with young-onset Alzheimer’s] on [TikTok], and I just thought, “I'm going to put a video out there.” And it has 2 million views, which is insane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I think all of the suggestions [from viewers commenting on the video] have been so amazing. They’re amazing for early-onset Alzheimer's, but I honestly think the suggestions are great just for everyday living, really. I mean, to minimize the things in your home, which I just did the other day — that was really helpful. [One commenter suggested making a playlist of favorite songs to stay connected to yourself.] I am 100% going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Somebody was saying to journal what I'm doing during the day because what's one of my new things is I shower and then two hours later I feel like I need to have a shower. I forget, so I'm trying to plan a shower, but I already had one. So people are saying, "Write down what you've already done during the day" as you're doing them, which is brilliant because when I forget that I've showered, I can just look and see that I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another one that’s on the top of my to-do list is to get a family member to join in on a bank account for me. That was a suggestion from a TikToker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I care so much about other people feeling held and heard and seen and supported, but seeing this community, that's made it even more important, and I just want them to know that. The response has been so incredible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you are a loved one [of someone with Alzheimer’s], my suggestion is to meet them where they're at. What I've found really helpful with my partner is not to be questioned but reminded, and to just believe them. And give them a hug. Tell them you love them. Because really, if I'm being completely honest, what I need is a hug from my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 10:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQMlktc0RuUUk1R1cwRV9GZVowZHZQMjJIcERRenNTSEtXOXFsdDdvRjZPLTRXUnlRcEl5VWtSUGZ4dFBrZm9rTEN0X2JxajJ0ME1GTmd5VUkweVluZ2FtTWYwWUE3WG41TG5tV2pHOUdrVnM0UGNvVkk1cmM2ZGh2aTJMM01DS3RfU1E</guid></item><item><title>肌酸：增强脑力的健美补充剂- BBC | Creatine: The bodybuilding supplement that boosts brainpower - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxNdzkwd2E5dG5hQXFqWlZzNGRlOGh0NEFKMktOWHpuZnhZdTFQTFppUXRxQVJZTnlZYWYyUGE5NE1VT3NKRENUd3JYV0NzNmVWMThtT2toMzVFV1p1QVUxZWVmUzZqQlN5Uzlua3FCYnE5UjBVR2puQWE1YWx6OTBOVEFsc1ZySXNSYmp1dWx0VTR3SE5OUFFEbTZqbFVLcERnenc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Creatine: The bodybuilding supplement that boosts brainpower&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250522-140200-09101d307-web-2.22.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0ld168t.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Alamy Fitness shakes on display in a supermarket (Credit: Alamy)" class="sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU"&gt;Alamy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="creatine-is-often-taken-by-people-looking-to-build-muscle.-now-scientists-are-investigating-the-effects-this-chemical-has-on-our-cognition-and-mood." class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;Creatine is often taken by people looking to build muscle.

(Do not try this at home.) This dose, Gordjinejad says, would pose a risk to people with kidney problems, and in the general population it could cause stomach pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gordjinejad plans to conduct a similar trial where he gives participants a smaller dose.

If creatine levels are low, this affects energy production in the brain, but also the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cureus.com/articles/301707-creatine-supplementation-in-depression-a-review-of-mechanisms-efficacy-clinical-outcomes-and-future-directions#!/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;levels of neurotransmitters&lt;/a&gt; – chemical signals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other – he says.

In 2023, Ostojic and colleagues from the University of Novi Sad, Serbia, tested the effects of creatine supplements in &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/fsn3.3597" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;19 patients with long Covid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers gave 4g of creatine to half the participants, and a placebo to the other half. Then they monitored their symptoms, and the levels of creatine in their brain and muscles. After six months, the team found that those who received extra creatine had improved symptoms, including less brain fog and concentration difficulties. The more severe the disease, the lower levels of creatine in their bodies had been at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The hypothesis was that the brain, under the stress of long Covid, depletes levels of creatine, which is a critical energy-supplying substance," Ostojic says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;While creatine isn't a cure for long Covid, Ostojic concludes, it could provide some benefits. But there's more work to do; he wants to better understand potential gender differences at play when it comes to creatine and conditions such as long Covid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Ostojic adds that women tend to lose more creatine through their urine and have lower levels of muscle mass compared to men. Since this is where most creatine is stored, it makes sense that women would have less creatine overall. "My preliminary feeling is that women with long Covid might respond better to creatine supplementation [than men]," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw"&gt;&lt;span id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="the" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;The&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="lifecycle" class="sc-d16436d-0 cVoAry"&gt;&lt;b id="lifecycle" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;lifecycle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The cells and tissues in our bodies use creatine as an energy source at every stage of reproduction, says Stacey Ellery, an NHMRC Peter Doherty early career research fellow at Monash University Australia. This incudes sperm motility, uterine and placental development, as well as foetal growth and breastmilk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Creatine may also have an important role in reducing the damage caused by a lack of oxygen, says Ellery, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2393-14-150" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;such as to foetuses during birth&lt;/a&gt; or in the womb. A lack of oxygen can restrict the ability of cells to generate sufficient energy in crucial tissues, such as the placenta and foetal brain, which can stunt their growth or impact their long-term health, she explains. But in the very short term, creatine can allow cells to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/maple-leaf/rcaf/2020/10/track-and-field-for-masters-athletes-6-understanding-energy-systems.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;release energy without needing oxygen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A creatine supplement can boost the creatine available to cells for energy production during oxygen deprivation," says Ellery.

Essential nutrients can't be synthesised by the body and, therefore, must be supplied from foods. However, some researchers, including Ostojic, argue that creatine should be categorised as semi-essential, as it appears we can't synthesise enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"A couple of studies suggest people who don't get any creatine from food have lower levels of creatine in their muscles, suggesting they're not able get it to the optimum point," says Ostojic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Creatine is not a silver bullet, he says, but argues it should be evaluated properly and evidence-based guidance should given to the population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Despite being the focus of many studies – and lacking in many people's diets – research on creatine's health benefits throughout our lives is still in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Researchers including Ellery are hopeful, though, that the rising academic interest in creatine will eventually translate into public health interest, so that we know which population groups would benefit from creatine supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id="*-all-content-within-this-column-is-provided-for-general-information-only-and-should-not-be-treated-as-a-substitute-for-the-medical-advice-of-your-own-doctor-or-any-other-health-care-professional.-the-bbc-is-not-responsible-or-liable-for-any-diagnosis-made-by-a-user-based-on-the-content-of-this-site.-the-bbc-is-not-liable-for-the-contents-of-any-external-internet-sites-listed,-nor-does-it-endorse-any-commercial-product-or-service-mentioned-or-advised-on-any-of-the-sites.-always-consult-your-own-gp-if-you're-in-any-way-concerned-about-your-health." class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;* All content within this column is provided for general information only and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

&lt;p&gt;Investigative journalist Charles Piller’s latest book, &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Doctored/Charles-Piller/9781668031247"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doctored: Fraud, Arrogance, and Tragedy in the Quest to Cure Alzheimer’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, came out in February. It details the work of Matthew Schrag, a neurologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., and other sleuths who uncovered evidence of problems in hundreds of research papers about the neurologic condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most reviews and coverage have been positive, Piller said. But some Alzheimer’s researchers have criticized the book in reviews published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831830"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00112-7/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the website &lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/papers/bad-medicine-doctored#comment-55066"&gt;Alzforum&lt;/a&gt;, which hosts news and commentary on Alzheimer’s research. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Piller and Schrag say they respect that others are entitled to their opinions, but expressed concern that some of these reviews contain inaccuracies that downplay their findings. And the journals and Alzforum have refused to publish responses they submitted or make corrections they requested. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-131931"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one instance, an editor at &lt;em&gt;Lancet Neurology&lt;/em&gt; refused to correct what Schrag claims are obvious errors in a review — including a mistaken but easily checked claim about citations — telling him the author of the article disagreed with “their interpretation” and rejected the need to fix his work. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the criticisms allege Piller’s book overplays the importance of the research misconduct that has undermined the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/11/amyloid-hypothesis-alzheimers-research-lecanemab-aduhelm/"&gt;amyloid hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer’s pathology, and called into question newly approved drugs targeting amyloid. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s been this notion there’s a cabal around the amyloid hypothesis,” Schrag said. “This type of censorship gives some credibility to that.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;We &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/02/04/undisclosed-conflicts-lightning-fast-peer-review-one-alzheimers-journals-role-in-a-failed-drug/"&gt;ran an excerpt&lt;/a&gt; of the book in early February and our Ivan Oransky &lt;a href="https://charlespiller.com/books/"&gt;called it&lt;/a&gt; “required reading for aspiring scientists, policymakers, and anyone who will one day be touched by a devastating disease – which is all of us.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2831830"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA &lt;/em&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; was the first of the critical appraisals to appear. Its authors claim the book details four instances of research misconduct in the field, when the sleuths found issues in hundreds of papers from dozens of researchers, Schrag said. &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Letter-JAMA-2025-FINALIZED.docx.pdf"&gt;He and Piller submitted a response&lt;/a&gt;, which the journal declined to publish “because of the many submissions we receive and our space limitations in the Letters section,” according to emails we’ve seen. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jen Zeis, JAMA Network’s communications and engagement director, told us the journal “cannot confirm or deny the status of any content that we haven’t published.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another inaccuracy Schrag and Piller identified in the critical reviews is the impact of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04533"&gt;2006 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;Schrag found&lt;/a&gt; apparently manipulated images. The authors &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/researchers-plan-retract-landmark-alzheimers-paper-containing-doctored-images"&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; the article last year, but it remains the fifth-most-cited retracted paper, by &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/"&gt;our count&lt;/a&gt;, with 2,384 citations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a post on &lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/papers/bad-medicine-doctored#comment-55066"&gt;Alzforum&lt;/a&gt;, John Hardy of University College London wrote the retracted paper “had no great influence in our field.” Hardy described himself as “a named member of this cabal” supporting the amyloid hypothesis in Piller’s book. He and his colleagues “never cited this work in our review of the amyloid hypothesis, nor did the other major reviews,” he wrote. Another Alzheimer’s researcher, Bart de Strooper, cited it “only” in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3028"&gt;critical review&lt;/a&gt;, Hardy claimed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But that citation record isn’t true, Schrag said. “It’s not clear to me why so much effort would be placed on the claim to have never cited this article, when it is so easy [to] debunk,” &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Dear-Colleagues-letter-for-AlzForumMSSfinal.docx.pdf"&gt;Schrag wrote in a response&lt;/a&gt; submitted to Alzforum. He included screenshots of Google Scholar pages showing multiple other papers in which Hardy and de Strooper had cited the 2006 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper. Web of Science corroborates those results, showing Hardy has cited the work four times, including in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627306007239"&gt;a 2006 &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; essay&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01249-0"&gt;2021 review in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and de Strooper has cited the paper 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hardy has not responded to our request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many other Alzheimer’s researchers chimed in with criticism of Piller and his book following Hardy’s post on Alzforum, which appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/papers/bad-medicine-doctored#comment-55066"&gt;a discussion thread&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; article. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-drop-cap"&gt;Piller said he’s used to criticism, and usually doesn’t get involved in arguments because he believes his work can stand on its own, but this case was different. “Many of the comments were untrue and they were mischaracterizations of the book, and many of them included ad hominem attacks on me personally,” he told us. If he and Schrag didn’t respond, he said, he felt like “it was essentially acceding to their arguments.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But as with &lt;em&gt;JAMA,&lt;/em&gt; when Piller and Schrag attempted to &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Charles-Piller-comments-re-critics-of-Doctored.pdf"&gt;submit responses&lt;/a&gt; to the thread, the editors declined to publish them. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Your argument has been promoted for months and continues to be widely available in your book and in various media reviews,” Gabrielle Strobel, Alzforum’s executive editor, wrote in an email to Piller. “We see nothing new in your comment, and have closed the conversation.” Strobel did not respond to our request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Piller noted that Hardy and other researchers who commented in the thread serve on Alzforum’s &lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/about-us/scientific-advisory-board"&gt;scientific advisory board&lt;/a&gt;. “When they let their advisors criticize me and won’t let any response come through, it seems strange,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At one point, Alzforum promoted the thread as a “debate,” Schrag said, but its editors wouldn’t let him and Piller respond. “Is this what leaders of the field want debate to look like?” Schrag said. “You only have a voice if you espouse the popular opinion?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hardy had initially written his Alzforum post as a book review for &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, but the journal declined to publish it, he wrote in his Alzforum post. A spokesperson for &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; told us when the editors commissioned the review, “we were unaware that Professor Hardy was a target of criticism in the book.” They decided not to publish the review after learning of his role during the editing process, as “the review may have been perceived by our readers to have a potential bias that could compromise the assessment.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(25)00112-7/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lancet Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; later published another version of Hardy’s critique. Schrag wrote to the journal to request corrections to four “provably false” claims in it, including about how de Strooper had cited the 2006 &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; paper. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our Book Reviews are opinion pieces, in which authors are invited to freely express their views,” editor Elena Becker-Barroso responded. “I have shared your concerns with Professor Hardy, who disagrees with your interpretation and does not see the need for Correction.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we asked Becker-Barroso for comment on the decision not to correct the article, she asked us where in the text the inaccuracies Schrag identified had appeared.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Please note the journal promotes scientific debate and we encourage authors to freely express their opinion in this sort of articles,” she wrote. “In which way should we correct Dr Hardy’s opinion?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experience is “very much more of the same” as his attempts to correct other problems in the scientific literature, Schrag told us. “You get the distinct impression that there’s very little concern about getting the facts right, at least in this case.” &lt;/p&gt;

Apart from religiously taking her metformin tablets, she did not think too much about her condition. Recently, however, constant fatigue, swollen ankles, and vision problems made her go back to her doctor. She was shocked when she was told that her blood sugar levels were too high, her haemoglobin and vitamin D levels were dangerously low, and that she was borderline obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I eat a normal diet and I do not indulge in sweets often. I do not know why my sugar is high or why I seem to be putting on weight, despite not eating much. The doctor wants me to eat more vegetables and fruits and switch from rice to ragi. But I work as a domestic help and mostly eat the food provided by my employers. Also, I cannot afford to buy fruits and vegetables on my income. Even fish has become so expensive. We also do not get pulses or legumes at subsidised rates from ration shops anymore,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sobha’s story is being played out across the country. People like her are among the millions of malnourished, obese, persons with diabetes in the country, who will, over time, develop serious complications of diabetes such as renal failure because basic lifestyle changes-- especially dietary changes -- that are required to keep non-communicable diseases (NCDs) under control are beyond their means. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Eating healthy is expensive &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a bid to ensure that people do not go hungry, the nation opted for food security, and for this calorie-dense grains and cereals are supplied at subsidised rates to people through the public distribution system. But it is the poor in the country who are now paying the price for the lack of nutritional content and dietary diversity in their food with their health. Healthy foods are expensive, and in the absence of any policy-level effort to make these accessible to the poor, the cycle of malnutrition, obesity, and NCDs will continue,” says T.S. Anish, Associate Professor of Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Manjeri.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global Food Policy Report 2024, ‘Food systems for healthy diets and nutrition’, released by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) last year, reported that 16.6 % of Indians suffered from malnutrition because of poor dietary habits. It said that at least 38 % of the Indian population ate unhealthy foods, while only 28 % ate all five recommended food groups, which included at least one starchy staple food, one vegetable, one fruit, one pulse, nut or seed, and one animal-source food.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another report, the United Nations’ State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report published in July last year said that 55.6% of Indians cannot afford a healthy, balanced, and diverse diet because eating healthy is a costly affair. This is however lower than the 2017 data, when the figure was 69.5 %. The report, published by five UN agencies, described a ‘healthy diet’ as comprising four key aspects: diversity (within and across food groups), adequacy (sufficiency of all essential nutrients compared to requirements), moderation (foods and nutrients that are related to poor health outcomes) and balance (energy and macronutrient intake). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Economic and gender disparities &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socio-economic and gender disparities have been fuelling India’s double burden of malnutrition -- a paradox wherein malnutrition co-exists with obesity. According to the WHO, “the double burden of malnutrition is characterised by the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity, or diet-related noncommunicable diseases, within individuals, households, and populations, and across the life course.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urbanisation seems to be one of the driving factors of this double burden, as the urban lifestyle encourages the easy availability of high-fat and ultra-processed food and beverages. The situation is exacerbated by additional factors such as low levels of physical activity and sedentary lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maternal undernutrition compromises foetal growth and increases the risk of children who may be underweight, stunted, and micronutrient deficient. On the other hand, maternal obesity or overnutrition could lead to gestational weight gain (possibly complicated by gestational diabetes) and babies who run the risk of insulin resistance in later life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per National Family Health Survey - 5 data, under-nutrition in children is rampant -- 36% stunted, 19% wasted, 32% underweight -- while among adults, 31.7% of women and 28.6% of men in urban areas and 19% of women and 18.8% men in rural areas were obese. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;Too many carbs, too little protein &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dietary Guidelines for Indians (DGIs) developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN), Hyderabad, and released last year, said that 56.4% of total disease burden in India could be attributed to unhealthy diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report recommended that no more than 45% of calories in the daily diet should come from cereals and millets; 15% from pulses, and beans (protein sources), and the rest should come from nuts, vegetables, fruits, and milk. But the reality of the Indian diet is that it is highly deficient in protein, with nearly 70% of the caloric requirement met through carbohydrates and the intake of micronutrient-rich vegetables, and fruits much below recommended levels.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission published recommendations about healthy diet patterns that can sustain 10 billion people in an environmentally friendly manner by 2050. In 2020, the International Food Policy Research Institute published a paper on how well the Indian dietary pattern fitted in with the EAT-Lancet reference diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that Indian households who spend the least on food show the greatest reliance on whole grains, starches, and processed foods, with little else. This pattern is maintained across the rural-urban divide. Protein makes up only 6-8% of the caloric intake, against the 30% in the reference diet. Fruits and vegetables make up about 8% of daily calories in the reference diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealthiest city dwellers get almost a third of their calories from processed foods. Even among the poorest, 8% of calories come from these foods for urban and rural residents. In South India, processed foods make up 13% of diets, vs. 8% in North-east and North India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study pointed towards “a lack of availability, accessibility, awareness, and acceptability” as other major causes for the poor quality of Indian diets and recommended that subsidies on healthy foods should be the norm. Large-scale awareness campaigns were needed to help people understand why their dietary diversity needed to improve. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;The need for affordable, diverse diets &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sreejith N. Kumar, a Thiruvananthapuram-based physician who has been at the forefront of Eat Right campaigns in Kerala, says that dietary diversity or the quality of one’s diet need not be a complicated affair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One just needs to follow the “MyPlate” dietary guideline (from the U.S. Department of Agriculture) which says that half of your plate be filled with fruits and vegetables, a quarter each is filled with grains and protein. This roughly falls in line with the ICMR-NIN guidelines that no more than 45% of calories come from cereals,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heavy reliance on carbs in every meal and sedentary work has led to spiralling levels of abdominal obesity in both rural and urban India. This excessive carb and fructose (from sugary, processed foods) intake is the starting point of fatty liver disease, a phenomenon that has engulfed Kerala, Dr. Sreejith says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring dietary diversity or the consumption from a wide range of food groups is key to achieving optimal nutrition and staving off micronutrient deficiencies and thus malnutrition.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFHS-5 data shows that only 28% of adults consume all five recommended food groups.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sreejith says that the first imperative to healthy eating should be awareness of the importance of dietary diversity and a change in mindset on what needs to be on one’s plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For healthy eating to be affordable, the accent should be on encouraging people to eat vegetables and fruits which are locally and seasonally available. You do not need broccoli, spinach, and Greek yoghurt, but can opt for the innumerable varieties of leafy vegetables (amaranthus), moringa leaves, and other local vegetables (eg: banana stem and flower). Eggs are an affordable source of protein,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to prioritise vegetables, include moderate amounts of protein and fat, and lower the amount of carbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="sub_head"&gt;The need for healthy food policies &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kerala, local self-governments and Kudumbasree units have taken up several initiatives at the ward level to encourage household vegetable farming in grow bags so that fresh produce is available at least in a small way in every household. However, larger policy initiatives are needed to support the nutritional requirements of a huge section of the nation’s population, including the subsidised supply of healthy and diverse food options as well as the imposition of a fat tax or health tax on the sale of ultra-processed and high fatty foods to limit the consumption of these items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this context, Arun Gupta, paediatrician, public health expert, and convenor of the Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest, points out that weak and subjective labelling and advertising laws are letting junk food giants enjoy the freedom to make profits at the expense of public health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an article in The Hindu, ‘Flawed food regulations fuel the obesity crisis’, Dr. Gupta says that the Economic Survey 2025 recommendation that a health tax be imposed on ultra-processed foods to curb their consumption is being derailed by the same “industry-friendly, subjective food marketing regulations”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“India should adopt a stringent front-of-pack marketing labelling system (to curb unrestricted advertisements of unhealthy processed foods); fix clear salt/sugar/fat limits for foods high in fat/salt and sugar and frame stringent advertising laws. Lastly, the government should consider launching a campaign on the risks of consuming ultra-processed food in all languages,” Dr. Gupta adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the State-level too, farming policies should be able to leverage local food systems which include a diverse variety of local vegetables, pulses, and millets, so that the nutritional content of diets can be improved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"&gt;&lt;p class="publish-time-new"&gt; Published &lt;span&gt;- May 27, 2025 03:03 pm IST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="d-block d-sm-none "&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Hindu</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>为什么人工智能可能会倾听您的下一个医生预约-《华尔街日报》 | Why AI May Be Listening In on Your Next Doctor’s Appointment - WSJ</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPN2JkeUlUN3Z4OUVodVd2djNDY1kzSERYLXNNUWV6Vm5kVkhlNDBEbkZPbFItblNudWxRWFp1Z1ZjekUzSnV0TjBZSF9wSHNPTklmc2F5aDFDWENVLXV0LV9xVGtmV0VsZVNnWjBCOHlkaHZKM215QXd5eHBJYk9xOVNpWFZYUXZYNmRueVdhMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WSJ</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPN2JkeUlUN3Z4OUVodVd2djNDY1kzSERYLXNNUWV6Vm5kVkhlNDBEbkZPbFItblNudWxRWFp1Z1ZjekUzSnV0TjBZSF9wSHNPTklmc2F5aDFDWENVLXV0LV9xVGtmV0VsZVNnWjBCOHlkaHZKM215QXd5eHBJYk9xOVNpWFZYUXZYNmRueVdhMA</guid></item><item><title>抑郁症有传染性吗？情侣可以通过接吻分享- Earth.com | Is depression contagious?

We accept the idea that couples influence each other’s habits, moods, and routines. But what if those changes extend far beyond conscious behaviors? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if even depression could shift between partners – not just through shared struggles, but through the very bacteria in your body beginning to mirror those of your spouse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by Iranian researcher Reza Rastmanesh presents a surprising theory: depression and anxiety might be contagious among couples – not just through shared &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/young-adult-depression-linked-to-worse-memory-skills/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional experiences&lt;/a&gt;, but through oral bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six months of marriage, healthy spouses living with a partner suffering from both depression and insomnia began to show measurable changes in their mood, sleep, and microbiota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oral microbiota transmission between individuals in close contact partially mediates symptoms of depression and anxiety,” noted the authors of the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research, while preliminary, opens a new frontier in how we understand emotional &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-related-brain-inflammation-linked-to-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;well-being&lt;/a&gt; within intimate relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-marriage-might-shift-mental-health"&gt;Marriage might shift mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on couples married for under a year, recruited from two private sleep clinics in Tehran. They selected 268 couples in which one spouse exhibited the “depression-anxiety phenotype” – defined by moderate depression, moderate anxiety, and significant sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these individuals lived with a partner who was initially healthy, free from &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teens-with-problematic-smartphone-use-suffer-from-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional&lt;/a&gt; and sleep disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured mental health using validated Persian versions of standard questionnaires: the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The researchers collected saliva to assess cortisol – a stress hormone – and mouth swabs to analyze bacterial composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months later, the healthy spouses had changed. Their depression, anxiety, and sleep scores increased, and their oral bacteria began to resemble those of their affected partner. Even more revealing, women appeared to be more vulnerable to these shifts than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couples-may-pass-on-depression"&gt;Couples may pass on depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouth-to-mouth bacterial transfer sounds unusual, but it is a daily part of close contact. Whether through kissing, sharing food, or simply breathing the same air, couples swap millions of microbes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, this poses no risk. But the Iranian study suggests that these exchanges may influence &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/millions-of-americans-have-lost-years-of-time-to-poor-mental-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The microbiota of a healthy spouse started to show elevated levels of bacterial groups previously linked to mental illness. These included Clostridia, Veillonella, Bacillus, and Lachnospiraceae. The researchers used advanced DNA sequencing and linear discriminant analysis to track these shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggested a microbial convergence. The oral ecosystems of the healthy partners grew more similar to those of their depressed and anxious spouses. Over time, emotional and biological states seemed to synchronize as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cortisol-rises-with-partner-s-depression"&gt;Cortisol rises with partner’s depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team measured cortisol, a hormone known to spike under stress. Cortisol can indicate how the body reacts to emotional burdens. At the start of the study, healthy partners had low levels. But after living with a troubled spouse, their cortisol levels rose dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female spouses saw particularly steep increases. In one part of the analysis, women’s cortisol nearly doubled. These hormonal changes paralleled shifts in depression and anxiety scores, reinforcing the theory that stress responses are shared on a physiological level in close relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adds weight to the idea that psychological synchrony in couples may not just be behavioral – it might also have microbial and hormonal dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-certain-bacteria-might-worsen-sleep"&gt;Certain bacteria might worsen sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oral microbiome is more than just an ecosystem of bacteria. It communicates with the brain through what scientists call the oral microbiota-brain axis. Changes in this microbial network may influence neurological pathways, potentially altering mood and cognitive states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insomnia severity in this study correlated with the presence of certain bacterial groups. Higher levels of Fusobacteria and Spirochaetota, for example, tracked closely with disrupted sleep. Healthy spouses began to show increased levels of these microbes after six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One especially interesting find was that a bacterium called Dialister – belonging to the Firmicutes family – was more abundant in women than men. This suggests that women may absorb and reflect microbial changes more intensely than their male counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-couples-might-unknowingly-share-depression-nbsp"&gt;Couples might unknowingly share depression &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that couples synchronize in fascinating ways. They may mirror each other’s heart rates, align their sleep cycles, or even exhibit similar cortisol rhythms. This new research suggests that oral bacteria may form another point of connection, influencing depression among couples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study discusses “social closeness” as a factor in microbial exchange. This refers not just to physical proximity but emotional bonds that enable deeper contact. The closer the relationship, the more likely it becomes for microbial and emotional states to influence one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may explain why couples often seem to echo each other’s mental states over time. Depression and anxiety could ripple through households, not just via conversations and behaviors, but via silent bacterial messengers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mood-and-bacteria-in-newlyweds"&gt;Mood and bacteria in newlyweds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted with care. The team excluded any participants taking antibiotics, pregnant women, or couples that had separated during the study period. Oral samples were collected from the palatine tonsils and throat. The DNA was extracted and sequenced using industry-standard protocols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants provided samples at the start and again six months later. Cortisol was measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses included logistic regression, correlation testing, and microbial diversity evaluation. All procedures followed ethical guidelines set by the Iran National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these strengths, the researchers acknowledge limitations. They only collected morning saliva, didn’t account for shared dietary changes, and relied on self-reported mental health scores. Still, the trends they uncovered were consistent and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-will-this-change-how-we-treat-couples"&gt;Will this change how we treat couples?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One implication is clear: emotional health within a couple may be more interconnected than we realized. Traditionally, doctors treat individuals. But this study raises the possibility that treating both partners may be more effective when mental health symptoms appear in one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study references animal research that supports this view. Transferring gut bacteria from depressed mice into healthy ones produced depressive behaviors. Similarly, probiotics have improved sleep and mood in mice exposed to stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that microbial environments might trigger emotional shifts, at least under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fecal microbiota-induced insomnia and depression-like behaviors in mice can be alleviated by microbiota-modulating probiotics,” wrote the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this effect translates to humans, we may need to rethink mental health therapy – not just for individuals, but for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-future-of-holistic-medicine"&gt;The future of holistic medicine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study hints at larger networks. The oral microbiome is linked to both the gut and ocular microbiomes. People suffering from dry eye syndrome, for example, often have depression or anxiety. These conditions may share more than emotional roots – they may share microbial ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such overlaps suggest that personalized medicine could one day include microbiome mapping. Couples might receive probiotic therapies together or undergo screenings that look at bacterial harmony in addition to emotional wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea aligns with the goals of predictive and personalized care. If bacterial shifts can predict emotional changes, then we might have a new tool for early diagnosis and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-love-health-and-invisible-influence"&gt;Love, health, and invisible influence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage, as it turns out, is not just a merging of hearts. It’s also a merging of ecosystems. When one partner carries the emotional burden of depression or anxiety, the other may feel it not just psychologically, but biologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research does not suggest people should avoid relationships with depressed partners. Instead, it encourages a more compassionate and scientifically informed view of mental health. If bacterial imbalances contribute to emotional distress, then treating those imbalances could offer hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies will need to confirm whether these effects are causal. But if they are, they could shift how we define and support emotional health – not only in individuals, but in the shared space between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, couples may influence each other in ways we’re only beginning to understand – and some of those influences might be microscopic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xiahepublishing.com/2472-0712/ERHM-2025-00013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Exploratory Research and Hypothesis in Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2025 09:01:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPazJLUFlZRktpU2poWldqN1ZYNHUybmk1QTAycGJBaUlxcFJTV01xanp5YTQ3VTU2dHZvenVacmpBeFpmOTBxbUplNGh2MlZ0TEhOSlB2RjFDaUZLNVM5MGxtamxodnl0TVA2eGNLWUQ4WW1weEd5R3BtekVQNF9SMUNBME1CUEU4V3ZfcWthLUhNMlU</guid></item><item><title>准备好进行心理重启了吗？报名参加我们的5天创意挑战赛。-《纽约时报》 | Ready for a Mental Reboot?

A secret code for a mental reboot?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There is, and it’s called creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Creativity isn’t a rare gift reserved for artists. Everyone is creative in some way, whether or not they think so, and research has shown that creative pursuits can improve your well-being and sharpen your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;You can get better at it, too. Cultivating creativity is like warming up before you exercise, said Jonathan Schooler, a psychologist and director of the Center for Mindfulness and Human Potential at the University of California, Santa Barbara. As you practice creativity, your brain becomes more limber. You become more open-minded and curious. Your mood lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Next week, we’re going to help you stretch and strengthen your creative muscles. Each day, you’ll spend a few minutes completing a stimulating and fun expert-backed exercise, with an explanation of the creativity principle behind it. By Friday, you should feel refreshed and inspired. We hope you’ll join us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-433ac70e"&gt;How to get started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To receive each day’s challenge, make sure you’re signed up for the Well newsletter. &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/well" title=""&gt;You can sign up here&lt;/a&gt; or below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you already receive the Well newsletter, you don’t need to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-12cc40b2"&gt;What you’ll get&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;An email will arrive in your inbox each morning from Monday, June 2 to Friday, June 6.

But one study recently put an even finer point on the trend: Young men in particular are the ones giving up binge drinking, defined as having five or more alcoholic beverages in one sitting for men, or four or more for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer Gen Z men than women reported binge drinking in the last month between 2021 and 2023, according to the April 2025 &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study in JAMA;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.

But a closer look shows that the closing gender gap is driven as much, if not more so, by falling bingeing rates among men, especially young adult males. So what’s inspiring young men to drink less or not at all? We looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-numbers-show"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All young adults were drinking less between 2021 and 2023, compared with the 2017-19 period, according to the study. Young women were binge drinking 13% less, but young men saw an even bigger drop — nearly 21%. So it’s not that more women are necessarily binge drinking now — it’s that fewer men are, and that shift has made women’s rates seem higher in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why young men are drinking less is still up for debate, notes study author and University of Pittsburgh internist &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/dgim/faculty_info.aspx/Shuey7447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bryant Shuey;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Bryant Shuey&lt;/a&gt;.

A decade later, he’s hosting the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thatsoberguy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:That Sober Guy;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Sober Guy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast and thinks that “people are waking up to the fact that … it’s so much cooler and respectable and how many more opportunities there are,” when you don’t drink, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-influencers-and-popular-podcasters-making-it-cool-to-drink-less"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are influencers and popular podcasters making it cool to drink less?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ramer, 43, and Saho, 31, are recovering alcoholics. Both grew up in households where drinking — often heavy drinking — was the norm, but it wasn’t talked about. While they’re not part of Gen Z, Ramer and Saho suspect that some of the younger generation had similar experiences. “It took me hitting my rock bottom and almost not being alive for me to tell my dad,” says Saho, referring to his drinking. “You should be able to talk to the men in your life, but until the past five or 10 years, no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s changing with social media, podcasts and vodcasts, especially given that many influential (and, in some cases, controversial) male podcasters with large followings of young men are sober and vocal about it: Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Huberman, for example, have all quit drinking. On &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gtt9bq/i_just_watched_hubermans_video_about_the_effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, several people said that Huberman’s episode on the effects of alcohol have gotten them to quit drinking. Hearing some of them talk about giving up alcohol to focus on the work they enjoy doing resonated with Saho.

But one study recently put an even finer point on the trend: Young men in particular are the ones giving up binge drinking, defined as having five or more alcoholic beverages in one sitting for men, or four or more for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Fewer Gen Z men than women reported binge drinking in the last month between 2021 and 2023, according to the April 2025 &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2832889?guestAccessKey=d47ec1d7-0eea-48ee-a6ad-a9356c6b5f85&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041625" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study in JAMA;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;study in JAMA&lt;/a&gt;.

But a closer look shows that the closing gender gap is driven as much, if not more so, by falling bingeing rates among men, especially young adult males. So what’s inspiring young men to drink less or not at all? We looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-the-numbers-show"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All young adults were drinking less between 2021 and 2023, compared with the 2017-19 period, according to the study. Young women were binge drinking 13% less, but young men saw an even bigger drop — nearly 21%. So it’s not that more women are necessarily binge drinking now — it’s that fewer men are, and that shift has made women’s rates seem higher in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Why young men are drinking less is still up for debate, notes study author and University of Pittsburgh internist &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link " href="https://profiles.dom.pitt.edu/dgim/faculty_info.aspx/Shuey7447" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Bryant Shuey;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Bryant Shuey&lt;/a&gt;.

A decade later, he’s hosting the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thatsoberguy.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:That Sober Guy;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That Sober Guy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; podcast and thinks that “people are waking up to the fact that … it’s so much cooler and respectable and how many more opportunities there are,” when you don’t drink, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="are-influencers-and-popular-podcasters-making-it-cool-to-drink-less"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are influencers and popular podcasters making it cool to drink less?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ramer, 43, and Saho, 31, are recovering alcoholics. Both grew up in households where drinking — often heavy drinking — was the norm, but it wasn’t talked about. While they’re not part of Gen Z, Ramer and Saho suspect that some of the younger generation had similar experiences. “It took me hitting my rock bottom and almost not being alive for me to tell my dad,” says Saho, referring to his drinking. “You should be able to talk to the men in your life, but until the past five or 10 years, no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That’s changing with social media, podcasts and vodcasts, especially given that many influential (and, in some cases, controversial) male podcasters with large followings of young men are sober and vocal about it: Joe Rogan, Theo Von and Andrew Huberman, for example, have all quit drinking. On &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1gtt9bq/i_just_watched_hubermans_video_about_the_effects/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Reddit;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:16;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, several people said that Huberman’s episode on the effects of alcohol have gotten them to quit drinking. Hearing some of them talk about giving up alcohol to focus on the work they enjoy doing resonated with Saho.
