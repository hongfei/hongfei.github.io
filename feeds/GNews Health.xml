While sedated, they performed amputations to her right leg below the knee, her left leg above the knee, her right arm, and her left hand, to preserve what remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Munoz said: 'Having been perfectly fine that morning, my body was now in a state of &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-c8076f70-511c-11f0-b835-69ff7119a9a2" class=""&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;... my family was contacted so that we could say our final goodbyes as I was expected to die that night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued in her GoFundMe &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-arisbeth-munoz-walk-again-fund-prosthetics"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;: 'It's difficult.

I think it's a bad dream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Arisbeth Munoz, 39, lost her right leg below the knee, her left leg above the knee, her right arm and her left hand due to sepsis and necrotizing fasciitis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She had initially gone to her local emergency room due to vomiting and pain in her body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For five months since being admitted into the ER, I was admitted into six different hospitals, and was able to keep breathing with the help of machines.

It is for this reason that I need your help more than ever, so I can afford these prosthetics.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the meantime, she's managing as best as she can and told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/logan-heights-mom-survives-flesh-eating-infection-faces-life-with-amputations"&gt;10News&lt;/a&gt;: 'I can eat [by] myself and brush my teeth by myself.

She sat down with her children and openly explained to them what her cancer diagnosis was and what it meant for the family going forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her diagnosis, De La Cruz, 43, has undergone weeks of chemotherapy treatments, surgeries with another to come, and has just begun immunotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People with this stage of triple-negative breast cancer have a five-year survival rate of up to 65 percent, but De La Cruz's prognosis is far more dim, telling her followers on &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tiktok/index.html" id="mol-c4deef00-510b-11f0-9d50-47d9571cdf5b"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; that she has a 20 percent chance of beating cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;De La Cruz typically records in one of two poses: lying down due to crippling fatigue that renders her bedbound some days, or driving to a doctor's appointment, whether it's to see a dermatologist from a facial rash due to chemo or the dentist to repair her decaying teeth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The true toll &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14177967/breast-cancer-rising-doctors-warn-american-women-report.html"&gt;her cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; is taking on the family was highlighted last month when the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-8ca86930-510c-11f0-9d50-47d9571cdf5b"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; resident received a phone call from her son's school that broke her heart, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The school nurse told her the boy, now 10, had been unusually tired during the day. When asked why, he mentioned said he was staying up most nights ‘because he thinks that while he’s asleep, I’m going to die,’ De La Cruz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There’s so much more to this process than just us battling cancer… It’s the fact that our kids are so traumatized,' De La Cruz added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As a parent you try to be strong for your children, but they watch you slowly change into someone completely different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Misty De La Cruz, 43, was diagnosed with stage three triple-negative breast cancer in 2023 and was given a 20 percent chance of survival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He was crying, and the only thing he asked was if I was going to die. I tried to reassure him that the doctors were going to do the best that they could do to make sure that that didn’t happen. But ultimately, there is never a promise from anyone, but I was gonna fight as hard as I could.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two years ago, at 41, De La Cruz began experiencing pain in her right breast during her period, a pain, she &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/mother-battling-stage-3-breast-cancer-gets-unexpected-call-from-school-nurse-exclusive-11751180"&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;PEOPLE, that ‘felt a little bit different’ from standard breast pain many women experience during their cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It persisted over several months until she went to see her gynecologist, who performed a standard mammogram and manual exam of her breasts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nothing looked suspicious, though her doctor noted that De La Cruz had dense breast tissue, which can make detecting nodules more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;De La Cruz went about her life as a busy working mom but said she harbored a feeling of uncertainty. Doctors brushed off her concerns, citing the healthy-looking mammogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, last summer, when doing her regular monthly manual breast exams, she found a pea-sized knot in her right breast that was not there the month before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was back in her doctor’s office within days and taken for another mammogram as well as an ultrasound, which can sometimes pick up on tumors hidden within dense breast tissue that a standard mammogram may miss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors rushed to perform a biopsy, ‘and within 48 hours, I had the results for that biopsy… and it came back for stage 2 triple-negative breast cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;De La Cruz is pictured pre-diagnosis with her doctors. She said she did not begin to feel sick until she started chemo, which caused severe fatigue, brain fog, and nausea &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But an oncologist soon informed her that the cancer was actually at stage 3 and had spread to her lymph nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So we needed to start immediately,’ De La Cruz said. ‘It’s going to wreak havoc and spreads especially quicker now because I had the biopsy and the mammogram, because radiation and agitating the tumor causes it to go crazy.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She began chemo within the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I still wasn’t sick,’ she added. ‘I really didn’t start getting sick until I started chemo,’ which causes nausea, exhaustion, hair loss, and a whole list of side effects that hit harder than the disease itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ensuing chemotherapy treatments ravaged De La Cruz’s body, causing such severe vomiting that her teeth began to rot, lethargy that left her bound to the couch, a rash across her face, and constant brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly 65 percent of women diagnosed with stage three triple negative breast cancer survive five years after their diagnosis. At this stage, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-12980937/Nurse-30-diagnosed-rare-aggressive-breast-cancer-patient-inspires-perform-breast-exam.html"&gt;the aggressive cancer&lt;/a&gt; has spread to the lymph nodes, six of which De La Cruz had surgically removed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recently learned that she carries a mutation on the BRCA2 gene that impedes the body’s ability to repair damaged DNA, allowing cells to accumulate damage and grow out of control, a hallmark of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women with this mutation have a 45 to 69 percent chance of developing cancer, and De La Cruz now worries for her daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The case rate of breast cancer among women as a rate per 100,000 people (light green squares) compared to the death rate shown by the green triangles . As death rates have plunged, case rates are still rising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 43, De La Cruz is not your typical cancer patient. Breast cancer is most common in women over 50, with the highest rates occurring in women over 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet signs are pointing to a spike in breast cancer among younger women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Radiologists affiliated with the American College of Radiology reported last year that new diagnoses of breast cancer in patients 20 to 39 rose by nearly three percent from 2004 to 2021, compared to just a 1.4 percent rise among women in their 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that cases in patients 40 to 74 increased by two percent per year from 2004 to 2012. But from 2018 to 2021, there was a 2.7 percent yearly increase. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have attributed rising levels of new advanced cancer diagnoses to federal guidelines that recommend mammograms starting at age 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Watching their mother fight cancer and the effects of chemo took a toll on her children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recounted a trip to the store with one of her sons who, while holding her hand, said he wished he had cancer instead of her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another time, one of her sons went to sit with her on the couch and would not let go of her arm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Checking your breasts should be part of your monthly routine so you notice any unusual changes. Simply rub and feel from top to bottom, in semi-circles and in a circular motion around your breast tissue to identify any abnormalities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He cried, ‘Please don’t die, mom.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I handle a lot of stuff that comes with my cancer,’ she said. ‘At the end of the day… I have to deal with the fact that they tell me I only have a 20 percent survival rate.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;De La Cruz underwent surgery to remove six lymph nodes to mitigate the spread of her cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will also undergo a double mastectomy, but can only do so after she finishes recovering from a breast reduction procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-misty-keep-her-family-home"&gt;started a GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; to help pay the exorbitant costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite her prognosis, De La Cruz tries to retain some type of normalcy for her children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'No matter how sick I am, every Sunday our family has a Sunday dinner. Usually, I’m the one to do all the cooking, but we’ve had to improvise.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 16:49:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxOSVJ6cHRqbnJkd3c5WEdkWGpfZEVTTzE2cjlYd2g0TWw5cXFqZ3c5Z3RkZHlScHlNblRUMDZrM29IWHlIZ3A3QzFPc2VTSXphcFF2TWl0dm5ldDROUVJXVEF1bFJUSWZEYUZjeTRiVlFtbWxnV2lvNXlLSUYxN3hOSUtzYVpzcEZqSVhEQmVqbUo4UDB6ZlRzNnhVRC0yUHlzclVJemtWR3RVTlptcW5uNnpB0gG3AUFVX3lxTFBzbkxCMjI1WXVxLUtjTUQ3bkpNLTJhYmlqc3pDNDNUNUFqZmw0cG5idHNkUUF5a2RLTTl1dE1nZGhQWTRPcm9ZOGxWUGEzUVIwTmZKbnIzTVoteDRRNlNPTmVjc3c1c1E1VFRsZXdhdlhVOXVLMzhNd2ROZzlQcERCNWlfOVFZVUlzSG5IdmpYQzRmWmlwU2hYTDZBLV9ZQW81RFAxTmZEYWcxZy1TZDFIUzNBU2dtdw</guid></item><item><title>美国人的问题和“发现”部分-壁垒 | The Problem with Americans and the “Finding Out” Part - The Bulwark</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxNWmpFTGtlMmdQQ2Fndkg5U1h2cHhuTzFOVDBITW12Z19MeWYtVE5iVHVLdFU2VjdYMGl2VHoxWVFobmVJa19RQTl1Z3ZzbHg0SngyRFpqb3QxMnd0Vjh1bFh3R1ZWZXdnWENBOVdKZ2UxekM4WjlyTk1yWkhUeFRpV1MtSEtDcDkzYnBlRVY3b0pXY2hIOE13aWktdGNhZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir="auto" class="body markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heads up:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; I won’t be here tomorrow—Flash has a baseball thing.

It’s good for America and good for the world that this adventure didn’t get out of hand and maybe even made the world (temporarily) a touch safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet, in my darker moments I find myself wondering if it wouldn’t be better for America’s long-term civic health if Trump hadn’t gotten lucky? Maybe it would be better if we had to take our consequences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Which is why I want to discuss a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; story about the measles and some very fine people in Texas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s go dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Bulwark</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 16:30:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxNWmpFTGtlMmdQQ2Fndkg5U1h2cHhuTzFOVDBITW12Z19MeWYtVE5iVHVLdFU2VjdYMGl2VHoxWVFobmVJa19RQTl1Z3ZzbHg0SngyRFpqb3QxMnd0Vjh1bFh3R1ZWZXdnWENBOVdKZ2UxekM4WjlyTk1yWkhUeFRpV1MtSEtDcDkzYnBlRVY3b0pXY2hIOE13aWktdGNhZw</guid></item><item><title>成人肚子时间可以解开因驼背在屏幕上而产生的可怕的“科技脖子”吗？ -卫报 | Can adult tummy time undo the dreaded ‘tech neck’ that comes from hunching over a screen? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1wFBVV95cUxOWnJLYklDMS1HWHR2SHR0TnlKWjVFWFFWaDBKQXdBSU5xSF9yZ2lxUnNGckdpT0J4OTdrZ0t3Nlkyd2RUQVhGU0tzTWdrU0JqRm4tS2pLVWJ6RmI5QllBYnZpYlRjUzFaUVhwVnVNR2NOZ0tlbU9nVGFidnVrYmdfYWxvTkF2NWcxNGM4TldmM3lrTTJ0ZDI5TkdwZXllUW1CY0ZzYnlCQmxaUmFvWm9DcG9lQllPcXpjanFZWGlkbVoyY1RnTC10aVBIa2JTWFl4eHlaOFE5Yw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Among the overwhelming quantity of information new parents must digest is the instruction to ensure their child gets adequate “tummy time” each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As the name suggests, it refers to periods of lying on one’s belly, which in babies serves to improve neck strength and prevent them developing &lt;a href="https://www.rch.org.au/kidsinfo/fact_sheets/Plagiocephaly_and_brachycephaly_-_misshapen_head/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;misshapen heads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"commentisfree","tags":[{"id":"commentisfree/series/antiviral","type":"Series","title":"Antiviral"},{"id":"commentisfree/commentisfree","type":"Blog","title":"Opinion"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/comment","type":"Tone","title":"Comment"},{"id":"australia-news/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"campaign/email/saved-for-later","type":"Campaign","title":"Saved for Later (newsletter signup)"},{"id":"campaign/callout/aus-callout-antiviral","type":"Campaign","title":"aus-callout-antiviral"},{"id":"profile/donna-lu","type":"Contributor","title":"Donna Lu","twitterHandle":"donnadlu","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/03/03/Donna_Lu.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=a8925092d8bdad81d1ee831d404c508c","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2022/03/03/Donna_Lu.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=c7bfd4eb2e72d15e4fc3ea510c6c89b2"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/australia-opinion","type":"Tracking","title":"Australia Opinion"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"commentisfree/2025/jun/25/can-adult-tummy-time-undo-the-dreaded-tech-neck-that-comes-from-hunching-over-a-screen","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Not content with letting infants have all the fun, adults have now co-opted the practice as a means of postural correction.

Other videos show static holds without arm support, in an arched Superman position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Various claims have been made about adult tummy time on social media, including that it can help “fix” one’s posture, alleviate neck and back pain, and undo “tech neck”, the hunched, head-forward position many of us inadvertently adopt while desk bound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="posture-and-pain" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Posture and pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Think of “good posture”, and the image of a soldier-like ramrod back might come to mind. “There are very strong cultural beliefs about what good posture is,” says Prof Leon Straker, of Curtin University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But despite strongly held assumptions that a slumped posture increases your risk of neck and back pain, researchers say there is little convincing evidence this is actually the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27174256/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study in teenagers&lt;/a&gt;, co-authored by Straker, found no association between sitting posture and neck pain, while a second – which &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33444448/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;tracked young adults&lt;/a&gt; over five years – found that, surprisingly, “people with the really direct upright posture – which we normally think of as good – actually had slightly increased risk of pain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The conclusion there is that posture is really important for function, but it doesn’t link strongly to your risk of pain,” Straker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We do have some evidence [in adults] that people that have neck pain do tend to lean forward as they’re sitting at, say, a computer,” the head of physiotherapy at the University of Newcastle, Prof Suzanne Snodgrass, says. But association is not causation – it’s unclear whether that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31773477/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;forward head position&lt;/a&gt; causes the neck pain, or whether people maintain that posture &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they have neck pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="c55f5ed4-ef2c-4e8c-95d5-39fa737f2bb4" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":13,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Is good posture overrated?

He points out that back pain is more strongly associated with low physical activity, stress, emotions and sleep than mechanical factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="can-tummy-time-fix-tech-neck" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Can tummy time ‘fix’ tech neck?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Extended hours in front of screens, &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/life-sized-model-shows-what-office-workers-might-look-like-in-20-years-11843868" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;gimmicky dolls made by office equipment companies&lt;/a&gt; would have us believe, will eventually turn us all into slouched Quasimodos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If you sit hunched for a long time, does your posture end up being stuck that way? I think there’s some merit to that,” Snodgrass says. “For a lot of the years of your life, you can reverse things by doing exercise and movement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The rationale for adult tummy time “is that if your spine is in the opposite position, rounded for a lot of the day, if you put it in that [extension] position, you’re kind of balancing it out,” she says. “Tummy time probably helps your lumbar spine [the lower back] more than it helps your neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But as for “fixing” posture, “it’s not going to change how you sit – it’s only going to move your spine in another way, to give it a bit more mobility when you’re doing other things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-22" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Saved for Later&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;newsletterId&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;saved-for-later&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;successDescription&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips&amp;quot;}"&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Though the evidence doesn’t suggest adult tummy time will change posture or risk of neck pain in the long term, back extension positions may help to maintain range of movement, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;He emphasises the “need to start gently and progress it sensibly, so that you’re not actually … creating pain by doing something that you’re body’s not used to”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="other-movements-to-try" class="dcr-12pc8kk"&gt;Other movements to try&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There is no single ideal posture linked to pain prevention,” Saragiotto says. Although tummy time positions are low risk and easy to do, “there are better interventions supported by evidence, such as … pilates, having a healthy lifestyle, and even walking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In an office environment, “having breaks and moving during the day is usually what will help more than having a perfect ergonomic posture,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="1bc1c605-0822-478e-88b4-f495772f754c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.EmbedBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="UnsafeEmbedBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"html":"&amp;lt;blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.dan_dpt/video/7501379896900472095\" data-video-id=\"7501379896900472095\""max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;\" &amp;gt; &amp;lt;section&amp;gt; &amp;lt;a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@dr.dan_dpt\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dr.dan_dpt?refer=embed\"&amp;gt;@dr.dan_dpt&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; If you’re looking to avoid the dreaded tech neck, here are 3 ways that I would go about it.  &amp;lt;a title=\"physicaltherapy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/physicaltherapy?refer=embed\"&amp;gt;#physicaltherapy&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;  Original poster: @charlom &amp;lt;a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - Dr. Dan, DPT\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7501379978248899359?refer=embed\"&amp;gt;♬ original sound - Dr. Dan, DPT&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script async src=\"https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js\"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;","alt":"Video about avoiding tech neck ","index":31,"isTracking":true,"isMainMedia":false,"source":"TikTok","sourceDomain":"tiktok.com"}'&gt;&lt;div data-component="click-to-view:tiktok.com" class="dcr-umpqcy"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-njwpqm"&gt;Allow TikTok content?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-j4jr8l"&gt;This article includes content provided by TikTok.

Also lifting through the lower abdominal muscles, so pulling them up and in shoulders back … And then just lifting your head nice and long, and standing tall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“At home, you can lie on your back, knees bent, and have your arms out to the side, like drawing angels in the snow … so that you’re stretching your arms. That will stretch out that upper back as well, and while you’re doing that, tucking the chin down to lengthen the back of the neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For strength, Straker also suggests exercises that involve lifting the head and neck against gravity, such as swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Any ongoing pain, the experts say, should be assessed by a health professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="8a6b8734-91d1-4e25-95b9-0e20dff67be4" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutBlockElementV2" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="CalloutBlockComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"callout":{"description":"&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;What health trend&amp;amp;nbsp;do you want examined?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;","prompt":"Share your experience","displayOnSensitive":true,"elementId":"8a6b8734-91d1-4e25-95b9-0e20dff67be4","title":"Share your experience","isNonCollapsible":false,"formFields":[{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_is_your_namepseudonym","id":"172730135","hideLabel":false,"label":"What is your name/pseudonym?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"what_news_story_or_health_information_being_shared_on_social_media_have_you_seen_that_youd_like_us_to_examine","id":"172730137","hideLabel":false,"label":"What news story or health information being shared on social media have you seen that you’d like us to examine","hidden":false,"type":"textarea","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"do_you_have_a_link_to_an_example_you_can_share","id":"173258657","hideLabel":false,"label":"Do you have a link to an example you can share?","hidden":false,"type":"text","required":false},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldRadio","name":"can_we_publish_your_response","options":[{"label":"Yes, entirely","value":"Yes, entirely"},{"label":"Yes, but contact me first","value":"Yes, but contact me first"},{"label":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous","value":"Yes, but please keep me anonymous"},{"label":"No, this is information only","value":"No, this is information only"}],"id":"172730143","hideLabel":false,"label":"Can we publish your response?","hidden":false,"type":"radio","required":true},{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.CalloutFormFieldBase","name":"email_address","description":"Your contact details are helpful so we can contact you for more information.

High levels of cortisol, the body’s primary stress hormone, can linger longer and interfere with memory and decision-making. Here’s a fact: It’s not a decline, it’s a signal. A signal to be more intentional about brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ankita Kaul shared five daily habits that can improve brain performance:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Practice daily mindfulness and reading:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep breathing, meditation, and reading books or articles help reduce stress hormones, calms the nervous system, and improves mental focus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Prioritise quality sleep:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the brain’s repair mode. It consolidates memories, clears toxins, and refreshes your ability to concentrate and make decisions. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fitness-coach-shares-10-healthy-habits-to-know-in-your-20s-sitting-for-too-long-wrecks-your-body-to-walking-10000-steps-101744772593164.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Fitness coach shares 10 healthy habits to know in your 20s: Sitting for too long wrecks your body to walking 10000 steps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness coach shares 10 healthy habits to know in your 20s: Sitting for too long wrecks your body to walking 10000 steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/04/18/original/skin_sleep_1744979694687.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Sleep helps in rejuvenating the body.(Shutterstock)" title="Sleep helps in rejuvenating the body.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Sleep helps in rejuvenating the body.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Move your body:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity boosts blood flow to the brain and increases BDNF. a protein that enhances learning, memory, and brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Feed your brain right:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporate brain-boosting foods like walnuts, berries, dark chocolate, leafy greens, and omega-3-rich seeds. What you eat directly affects how you think and feel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Acceptance:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all have visualised our life a certain way and it’s not turning out to be, but we cannot harm ourselves emotionally by thinking everyday about our situations. We need to accept what life has given to us and make the most of our resources around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Be more conscious and take care for your mind. Because the smartest thing you can do for your brain is to start giving it what it really needs daily. Remember to take control of your mind than the mind controlling you,” said the wellness coach. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/selfcare-and-wellness-11-small-healthy-habits-to-boost-your-overall-wellbeing-101714738031992.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Self-care and wellness: 11 small healthy habits to boost your overall well-being"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-care and wellness: 11 small healthy habits to boost your overall well-being&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In this study, we report the generation of fertile androgenetic mice,' the Chinese experts say in their paper, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2425307122"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our findings, together with previous achievements of uniparental reproduction in mammals, support previous speculation that genomic imprinting is the fundamental barrier to the full-term development of uniparental mammalian embryos.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts caution that we are not ready to start such experiments in humans, which could be deeply unethical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Christophe Galichet, research operations manager at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre in London, points out that the success rate of the experiments was very low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of 259 mice embryos that were transferred to female mice, just two survived, grew to adulthood and then fathered their own offspring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This research on generating offspring from same-sex parents is promising,' Galichet, who was not involved with the experiments, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2485396-mice-with-two-fathers-have-their-own-offspring-for-the-first-time/"&gt;New Scientist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[But] it is unthinkable to translate it to humans due to the large number of eggs required, the high number of surrogate women needed and the low success rate.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, gay couples who want to have children usually rely on a surrogate mother or father to bring a child into the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Today, gay couples who want to have children usually rely on a surrogate mother

it? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;ol class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Experts took sperm from two male mice and injected it into an immature egg cell with its genetic material removed (known as enucleation)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Gene editing was then used to reprogram seven parts of the sperm DNA to allow an embryo to develop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;The embryo, featuring the genetic material from two fathers, was transferred to a female womb and allowed to grow to term &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;The offspring grew to adulthood and became a parent after mating with a member of the opposite sex &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;These offspring appeared normal in terms of size, weight, appearance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike with a pair of heterosexual parents, this means that one of the couple is not actually related to the child. So it's long been a dream for gay couples to raise a child who has genetic material from both fathers (or both mothers). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Back in 2023, researchers revealed they'd been able to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11837591/Scientists-create-mice-TWO-biological-fathers.html"&gt;create mice from two biological fathers for the first time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because mice are actually genetically very similar to us, the promising results hinted the feat could be replicable in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But even if a human child could be birthed from two fathers, it potentially threw a huge ethical quandary into the mix: What if that human child is not able to have children of their own through normal conception when they reach adulthood?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fortunately, these new experiments suggest this might not be an issue.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The human related to both of his or her fathers would grow up and be able to have a family of their own, the results suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During heterosexual reproduction, genetic material from a male carried by the sperm combines with genetic material from a female contained in the egg, or ovum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, a group of genes called 'homologous chromosomes' from the mother come together with those from the father and combine in a process called 'crossing over'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A gene editing technique was then used to reprogram parts of the sperm DNA to allow an embryo to develop – a process called androgenesis (file photo) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-6265453/Hope-gay-couples-want-children-mice-two-MOTHERS-born-China.html"&gt;when both sets of homologous chromosomes come from either two males or two females&lt;/a&gt;, the genes don't copy over properly, leading to 'imprinting abnormalities' and developmental defects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why the researchers had to turn to gene editing, which makes tweaks in the DNA, and target genes responsible for imprinting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are also considering this approach in larger animals like monkeys – but the technological hurdles will be significantly larger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Helen O’Neill, molecular geneticist at the University College London, called the new work a 'major step forward'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It confirms that genomic imprinting is the main barrier to uniparental reproduction in mammals and shows it can be overcome,' she told New Scientist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this year, another Chinese team got mice with two fathers to grow to adulthood &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14333227/First-mouse-two-biological-FATHERS-gay-men-children.html"&gt;by editing 20 different genes in their stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, but the rodents weren’t fertile. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox sciencetech" data-version="2" id="mol-e5371a60-5107-11f0-991e-b313021459ca"

editing?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Genome editing enables scientists to make changes to DNA, leading to changes in physical traits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists use different technologies to do this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These technologies act like scissors, cutting the DNA at a specific spot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then scientists can remove, add, or replace the DNA where it was cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The first genome editing technologies were developed in the late 1900s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More recently, a new genome editing tool called CRISPR, invented in 2009, has made it easier than ever to edit DNA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The acronym stands for 'Clustered Regularly Inter-Spaced Palindromic Repeats'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The technique involves a DNA cutting enzyme and a small tag which tells the enzyme where to cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By editing this tag, scientists are able to target the enzyme to specific regions of DNA and make precise cuts, wherever they like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been used to 'silence' genes - effectively switching them off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cellular machinery repairs the DNA break, it removes a small snip of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this way, researchers can precisely turn off specific genes in the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: US National Human Genome Research Institute

itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading psychiatrist has revealed his 'guilt' over America's spiraling autism crisis, after his team's work led to an explosion in cases — and fueled the anti-vaccine movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the 1980s, around one in 2,000 children had autism in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But by the turn of the century, this had jumped 13-fold to one in 150 children&lt;span&gt;, in large part due to Dr Allen Frances and his team's updated guidelines for diagnosing autism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the first time, doctors began recognizing Asperger's syndrome — a milder condition where patients develop in a typical way in early life but tend to have difficulty with social cues, empathy and forming relationships — as a form of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2013, building on his team's work, the definition was loosened yet again to include even milder cases, and autism was re-defined as 'autism spectrum disorder'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The result was, according to Dr Frances, that children were 'labeled with a serious condition for challenges that would better be viewed as a variation of the normal'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today, around one in 31 children have autism spectrum disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m002dz62"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Frances said: 'It's a kind of mea culpa — we had good intentions that led to terrible unintended consequences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Allen Frances, a top psychiatrist, led an update to the guidelines for diagnosing autism in 1994 that loosened the definition to include people with milder symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel very guilty that through our well-meaning but misguided efforts, we've contributed to the anti-vax movement.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Duke University professor added: 'It was absurd [the link between vaccines and autism], I knew the problem was definitional and increased assessment and popularity of diagnosis, not vaccines.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The anti-vaccine movement in America gained traction after a now-debunked 1998 study falsely linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot to autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite overwhelming scientific evidence disproving any connection, the myth spread online and has fueled growing distrust in vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now amplified by Covid pandemic-era skepticism, the movement has led to falling vaccination rates and a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fact autism rates have risen drastically in that time has fueled these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Frances led the team that updated the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1994, which sets the definition of conditions like autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His team loosened the definition amid requests from child psychiatrists and pediatricians who said the extremely stringent criteria were leaving children with similar symptoms, but milder, without access to health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health insurance generally only covers autism treatment — speech therapy and strategies to manage symptoms — for people diagnosed with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the team's modeling predictions suggested that loosening the definition would have only a modest impact on diagnostic rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Frances added: 'What we did was introduce something called Asperger's disorder, and that evolved into autism spectrum disorder — which can be ever so much more mild in its presentation and therefore very much more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So this meant that the symptoms of autism as currently used or defined by many clinicians, and certainly self-defined by patients and families, would include many people who have normal social awkwardness, eccentricities, difficulties relating to people that previously would never have been considered a mental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But now, because of the loosened definition, because of the fact that school services are tied to having the diagnosis of autism, and perhaps most of all because of the internet popularity of self-diagnosis... we have this enormous increase in rate.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added in an op-ed in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/opinion/why-autism-rates-increased.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that cases were further skyrocketing because autism spectrum disorder was so difficult to diagnose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There is no biological test; symptoms vary greatly in nature and severity; clinicians don't always agree; different diagnostic tests may come up with different conclusions; and the diagnosis is not always stable over time,' he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diagnostic inaccuracy contributes to falsely elevated rates, which can lead to misconceptions that an "epidemic" is occurring.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Junior has vowed to find the cause of spiking autism diagnoses, which he blames on '&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14619009/RFK-Jr-toxins-causing-autism-epidemic.html"&gt;environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April, he said he would commission a series of studies into whether mold, pesticides, food chemicals or medicines were raising the risk of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr also raised the possibility that ultrasound scans, used routinely to monitor babies before birth, could be behind the surge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as children, about 5.4million adults, equivalent to about one in 45 people, are now considered to have autism in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are increasingly raising concerns over autism misdiagnoses, saying some people told they have the condition may instead have something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; A &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-020-01189-w"&gt;2020 review study&lt;/a&gt; found of those diagnosed with autism 20 percent had anxiety disorders while 11 percent had depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Among famous people who say they have autism is Elon Musk, pictured above last year while attending the Breakthrough Prize Awards in Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Frances said that autism diagnoses in children should not be viewed as permanent, like they currently are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Diagnoses in kids, particularly, should be written in pencil,' he said, 'because they are so often unreliable and unstable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead, there's a tendency that once a diagnosis is made it gets on medical charts and it's sort of written in stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It lasts forever and it can haunt someone for the rest of their life who had a misdiagnosis of autism early in their life, and who changed self-expectations and external expectations as a result.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Donald Trump has vowed to 'get to the bottom' of the uptick in autism rates in the US, saying in an interview that there was 'something going on'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform, in March: '20 years ago, autism in children was one in 10,000. NOW IT'S 1 in 34. WOW! Something's really wrong. We need BOBBY!!! Thank You! DJT.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:06:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNV0pvNVlaaVl2QnBVR2c1Rkx1YjdrVzl2cXAweWZxMDY0bGZWY0JxXy1vZlgyNGtmb1Y2TkYwY0g0OWNfaDZuLVBvdUZfUU1xLWNCVExxb09EeWY1Nkd3dUpfc3VybVpmRzZpQUpOd0ZMR1FQV0tnS1lYS2JTUzQ3WmNwN0tZc1lNMk5nTlJyUWF6bzTSAZgBQVVfeXFMTkl1a1BUNVVaTmFuWWp3TVFuLVd6cUp0QVhFWFJoUlRrYmc0ekU0STJuRE9OSnQxaEE1LU9aSVZZMnNDNWctZ2tZM3hHLWNvc0dld3l3X0llZTVEZk01RHU2STlETUZuQ3BSXzRCbVZveHNFZzI5MDd0RkttSm5QekFWdnhQa0hfalBoc3dxRFFraS0tTFBycVY</guid></item><item><title>《Ozempic Might Be a Dementia Buster》- Gizmodo | Ozempic Might Be a Dementia Buster, Too - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTFB0b1ZuN2QyX05Rb1RWZXpZYzZLRWFlRWx0NVpRakxidTgwNlpyNWdjNTg3d1NVc242UUdQUF9TSXNldFM3Tkw2eDFSaC1LRHZ2bDJSdjd0Mk1sOGYtQzlPVGQ5RmVjeG9Dc3NIVGNZNHcxMTMzdklLdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, might also double as a brain booster. Research out today describes a link between semaglutide use and a reduced risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Case Western Reserve University conducted the study, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/13872877251351329"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. They found that diabetes patients taking semaglutide have a significantly lower risk of dementia than those taking other diabetes medications. The findings should prompt further study into this connection, including clinical trials, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GLP-1 drugs were first approved to help control blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. Newer GLP-1 agents, such as semaglutide, have also proven to be &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-tirzepatide-weight-loss-drugs-future-uses-1851116318"&gt;substantially more effective&lt;/a&gt; at helping people lose weight than diet and exercise alone. Studies are also showing that the health benefits of GLP-1s can extend beyond just weight loss. Study researcher Rong Xu and her team have been looking into some of these potential added benefits. Their past studies have suggested that semaglutide can help temper cravings for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/dont-look-now-but-ozempic-might-help-you-quit-smoking-too-2000481229"&gt;nicotine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/could-ozempic-help-reduce-opioid-overdose-risk-2000503728"&gt;opioids&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There is currently no known cure for dementia, as Xu notes. But up to half of all dementia cases might be preventable, and scientists have identified over a dozen modifiable risk factors that contribute to dementia risk, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease—all conditions that GLP-1s like semaglutide are known to address. GLP-1s also seem to generally reduce inflammation, yet another contributing factor to dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given all that, “semaglutide has emerged as a promising candidate” for a preventative treatment that can tackle multiple drivers of dementia risk, Xu told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers had already &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14313"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a link between semaglutide use and a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia. The team, wanting to test its hypothesis with other related dementias, analyzed the medical records of around 1.7 million patients with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Over a three-year span, they found that people on semaglutide had a noticeably lower risk (around 40% to 50% lower) of developing any Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia than those taking any of seven other diabetes medications, including insulin and metformin. This pattern could be seen among men, women, younger and older patients, and in people with or without obesity. On closer inspection, however, a reduced risk associated with semaglutide was only found with vascular dementia (the second-most common form of dementia), and not with Lewy body dementia or frontotemporal dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As we and others have previously shown benefit for semaglutide and other GLP-1RA medications in [Alzheimer’s disease], our results support the GLP-1 receptor as a target for dementia prevention,” they wrote in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings aren’t definitive, however, and can only show a correlation between semaglutide and lower dementia risk. That said, there’s been a lot of evidence— much of it encouraging—to warrant clinical trials that could truly show a causal effect, the researchers say. Indeed, Novo Nordisk, the developers of Ozempic and Wegovy, are currently conducting &lt;a href="https://www.alzint.org/about-us/funders/corporate-partner-novo-nordisk/"&gt;two large-scale trials&lt;/a&gt; testing semaglutide for Alzheimer’s (both are expected to finish as early as this year). Xu and her team also next plan to study whether tirzepatide and other emerging, potentially more effective GLP-1 drugs can provide an even greater buffer against dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newborn babies and patients with Alzheimer's disease share an unexpected biological trait: elevated levels of a well-known biomarker for Alzheimer's, as shown in a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/3/fcaf221/8158110" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at the University of Gothenburg and published in &lt;i&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;First author Fernando Gonzalez-Ortiz and senior author Professor Kaj Blennow recently reported that both newborns and Alzheimer's patients have elevated blood levels of a protein called phosphorylated tau, specifically a form called p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This protein has largely been used as a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease, where an increase in p-tau217 blood levels is proposed to be driven by another process, namely the aggregation of b-amyloid protein into amyloid plaques. Newborns (for natural reasons) do not have this type of pathological change, so interestingly, in newborns increased plasma p-tau217 seems to reflect a completely different—and entirely healthy—mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large international study that involved researchers in Sweden, Spain and Australia analyzed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from more than 400 individuals, including healthy newborns, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/premature+infants/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;premature infants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt;, elderly adults, and people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. They found that newborn babies had the highest levels of p-tau217—even higher than those found in people with Alzheimer's. These levels were particularly elevated in premature babies and started to decrease over the first few months of life, eventually settling to adult levels.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;First time in the blood of newborns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous research, largely based on animal models, had hinted at the role of phosphorylated tau in early brain development. This is the first time scientists have directly measured p-tau217 concentrations in the blood of human newborns, opening the door to a much clearer understanding of its developmental role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's where it gets fascinating, while in Alzheimer's disease p-tau217 is associated with tau aggregation into harmful clumps called tangles, believed to cause the breakdown of brain cells and subsequent cognitive decline. In contrast, in newborns this surge in tau appears to support healthy brain development, helping neurons grow and to form new connections with other neurons, thereby shaping the structure of the young brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed that in both healthy and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/premature+babies/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;premature babies&lt;/a&gt;, p-tau217 levels were closely linked to how early they were born. The earlier the birth, the higher the levels of this protein, suggesting a role in supporting rapid brain growth under challenging developmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential roadmap for new treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's perhaps most compelling about these findings, is the hint that our brains may once have had built-in protection against the damaging effects of tau, so that newborns can tolerate, and even benefit from, high levels of phosphorylated tau without triggering the kinds of damage seen in Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"We believe that understanding how this natural protection works—and why we lose it as we age—could offer a roadmap for new treatments. If we can learn how the newborn brain keeps tau in check, we might one day mimic those processes to slow or stop Alzheimer's in its tracks," says Gonzalez-Ortiz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while an increase of p-tau217 is a danger signal in older brains, in newborns it might be a vital part of building one. The same molecule, two dramatically different roles—one building the brain, the other marking its decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma p-tau217 has recently received FDA approval for use in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, making it an increasingly important tool in clinical settings. The authors emphasize the need to also understand the mechanism for the increase in p-tau217, especially for interpreting it as an outcome in clinical and epidemiological research and in drug development. This study indicates that amyloid plaques may not be the main driver of increases in p-tau217.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;We know that sitting for long periods of time &lt;a href="1-4-billion-adults-have-high-of-disease-from-not-enough-exercise-say-who" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;isn't good for us&lt;/a&gt;, but just how much exercise is needed to counteract the negative health effects of not escaping our desk all day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests about 30 to 40 minutes of building up a sweat should do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Committing to a good half our or so of "moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity" at some point each day ought to balance out 10 hours of sitting still, the research says – although any amount of exercise or even &lt;a href="even-2-hours-a-day-of-standing-instead-of-sitting-is-good-for-you-study-suggests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;just standing up&lt;/a&gt; helps to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's based on a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/meta-analysis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73088" data-postid="165293" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; study published in 2020 analyzing nine previous studies, involving a total of 44,370 people in four different countries who were wearing some form of fitness tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a short summary:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis found the risk of death among those with a more sedentary lifestyle went up as time spent engaging in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In active individuals doing about 30-40 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity, the association between high sedentary time and risk of death is not significantly different from those with low amounts of sedentary time," the researchers explained in their &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/24/1499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Much Sitting Can Still Be Harmful Even if You Exercise, Study Warns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, putting in some reasonably intensive activities – cycling, brisk walking, gardening – can lower your risk of an earlier death right back down to what it would be if you weren't doing all that sitting around, to the extent that this link can be seen in the amassed data of many thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_151064" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151064" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable.jpg" alt="Man Sitting At Table" class="wp-image-151064 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable-392x415.jpg 392w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/ManSittingAtTable-600x636.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-151064" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Too much time sitting down isn't good for you, but you might be able to offset the harm.

As more data gets published, we should learn more about how to stay healthy even if we have to spend extended periods of time at a desk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the new guidelines reflect the best available science, there are still some gaps in our knowledge," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/exercise-can-offset-the-risks-linked-to-sitting-around-all-day" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;said Stamatakis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are still not clear, for example, where exactly the bar for 'too much sitting' is.

Despite the frequent discussions about heart health, many of us unknowingly partake in behaviours that can harm this crucial organ.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaking earlier this year for Heart Awareness Month, a leading cardiologist explained the five daily activities that might be jeopardising your cardiovascular health. From sleep patterns to stress levels, these habits could be causing more harm than you realise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Five things damaging your heart health&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Lack of physical activity&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain, high cholesterol, and increased blood pressure, all of which increase your risk for cardiovascular disease," cautioned Dr Christopher Broyd, consultant cardiologist at Nuffield Health Brighton Hospital. "Regular exercise is crucial for heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there's no need to stress yourself into hitting the gym every day - just start with small steps. "Begin with simple activities like walking, stretching, or using a stationary bike," suggested Dr Broyd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Even short bursts of activity, such as 10-minute walks, can add up over time and gradually increase your stamina."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, select activities that you find enjoyable. "Whether it's dancing, swimming, cycling, or playing a team sport, finding something fun makes it easier to stay motivated," advised Dr Broyd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Try to pick a time of day that works best for you and stick to it, whether it's in the morning, during lunch breaks, or in the evening."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Stress&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chronic stress - such as that caused by demanding jobs or family issues - can contribute to heart problems, warned the cardiologist. "Prolonged stress can negatively affect the heart by raising blood pressure and increasing the risk of heart attack or stroke," explained Dr Broyd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Stress also encourages unhealthy coping mechanisms, like overeating or smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Chronic job stress can elevate blood pressure, lead to poor eating habits, and disrupt sleep, all of which can harm heart health over time."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, it's vital to have effective coping strategies for managing stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Regular physical activity, such as walking, yoga, or exercise, can help release built-up tension and improve mood by boosting endorphins," suggested Dr Broyd. "Some find that mindfulness techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation can calm the mind and reduce stress levels."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31924229" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Not prioritising sleep&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Lack of sleep or poor-quality sleep can increase blood pressure, contribute to obesity, and disrupt the body's natural repair processes," warned Dr Broyd. "Sleep disorders like sleep apnoea can also significantly affect heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Dr Broyd, establishing a regular sleep routine can help achieve natural and restful sleep. "Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends," advises Dr Broyd. "This helps regulate your body's internal clock and promotes a more consistent sleep pattern. Engage in calming activities before bed, such as reading and avoid stimulating activities like watching intense TV shows."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Broyd also recommended limiting caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol consumption in the evenings. "Consuming caffeine or nicotine in the late afternoon and evening can interfere with sleep," Dr Broyd warned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Similarly, while alcohol may initially make you feel sleepy, it can disrupt your sleep cycle later in the night."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Insufficient sunlight exposure&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A lack of sunlight exposure can lead to vitamin D deficiency, which has been linked to higher blood pressure, inflammation, and an increased risk of heart disease," Dr Broyd said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Safe sun exposure or supplementation can help maintain heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During winter months, taking short breaks to step outside is crucial. "If you're working or studying indoors, take short breaks to step outside and soak up some sun," Dr Broyd recommended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Aim to get outside for at least 15-30 minutes each day, especially in the morning when the sun is less harsh. Take walks, sit in a park, or enjoy outdoor activities like gardening, walking the dog, or even having lunch outside."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31924226" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Social isolation&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Being socially isolated or feeling lonely can increase your risk of heart disease," Dr Broyd explained. "Studies have shown that loneliness can trigger stress, raise blood pressure, and negatively affect immune function, all of which can harm heart health."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're experiencing loneliness, it's advisable to get in touch with friends or family, or perhaps join a new club. "Improving social isolation takes time and effort, but by making intentional efforts to connect with others and build relationships, you can enhance your social support network and overall wellbeing and ultimately improve your heart health," Dr Broyd advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:48:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNNi1PVEtUaHJwRzJuYWx3ckVqQm5MN185T0xNOWlOc1daS0NfSVZsN3RBN2Y2RjZidy1xbklQOXlFc1RONkNaek1uR2p1cGJ3MGdWcHBpNlM1ZlNDSzM0S3JwRFY1R3ZGSEI1Mk1qclRTemhNYmZHZ3c1N3FXRXlidzZfZVV4b0lxdnd0X0h1OGlRQQ</guid></item><item><title>第三例麻疹确诊，大特拉弗斯县宣布爆发- WPBN | Third measles case confirmed, Grand Traverse County declares outbreak - WPBN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxQVVZzdUN0VkxnV045dGZQUFdZOWxqWXRKZll0djBVZjRYXzZqNHJjNG0wc0ZNelJId1JlNjJiVGI2eVV3bDUweEwtZ2FpSHJsUHRvd195WW1SUkpEZkhTOVZXWEdBbzVzTHg2cWgtcmpKa19STGhqeGFjbE9FenJhaDk4ZlJwYkNZQXpwbWdsUXZmV1NqQktQSmoyUlJ6b0lETndxM19B?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GRAND TRAVERSE COUNTY, Mich., (WPBN/WGTU) -- Local health departments are saying there is a measles outbreak in Grand Traverse County after a third case was confirmed on Monday, June 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grand Traverse County Health Department (GTCHD) and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) said an outbreak is defined as three or more related cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first case of measles in the county was reported June 18, 2025. This was the first Grand Traverse County case since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, a second case was reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important that we, as the public health department, take action to protect, maintain, and improve the health of our community,” said Mike Lahey, MPH, Health Officer at GTCHD. “Measles is a serious disease, and we want to make sure that our residents and visitors are safe. Those who are not vaccinated against measles should consider getting vaccinated during this busy travel time in our community. It is important to make sure you protect yourself and your family from this vaccine-preventable disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no new public exposure sites to be reported, and all confirmed cases in Grand Traverse County have been determined to be linked to one another by GTCHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of measles usually begin 7-14 days after exposure, but can appear up to 21 days after exposure and may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever (may spike to over 104F).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Runny nose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tiny white spots on the inner cheeks, gums, and roof of the mouth (Koplik Spots) may appear two to three days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that is red, raised, blotchy; usually starts on the face, spreads to trunk, arms, and legs three to five days after symptoms begin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone experiencing symptoms is urged to call their healthcare provider. If seeking in-person medical attention, call ahead to inform your doctor, urgent care, or emergency room of the potential measles exposure before arrival so facilities may take precautions to prevent exposure to other individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, if it has been less than six days since the potential exposure, you may be able to receive post-exposure treatment that could prevent illness. Contact your healthcare provider, pharmacy, or local health department for vaccination and guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GTCHD has a measles hotline that can be reached during normal business hours, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at 231-995-6800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the line will be monitored from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Saturday, June 21st, and from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Sunday, June 22nd. If outside of office hours, Grand Traverse County residents can also contact 2-1-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WPBN</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:42:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQVVZzdUN0VkxnV045dGZQUFdZOWxqWXRKZll0djBVZjRYXzZqNHJjNG0wc0ZNelJId1JlNjJiVGI2eVV3bDUweEwtZ2FpSHJsUHRvd195WW1SUkpEZkhTOVZXWEdBbzVzTHg2cWgtcmpKa19STGhqeGFjbE9FenJhaDk4ZlJwYkNZQXpwbWdsUXZmV1NqQktQSmoyUlJ6b0lETndxM19B</guid></item><item><title>Golden Retriever在可爱的视频中展示了许多打嗝的方法- AOL.com | Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1pZERIaGZZblhpbkVfbDhTWVBwRGphNV9pWjRheS0wTnNaRlNkWXRSQWVUdERCMndCaEVmc213RjRKV3ZoeXF4UndLek1nak1OUzRYYUFla19qTlAwSVZxM1c4VkM5OTVEdnFWdC1ZR2lXWl9IM1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @daisythegoldiee / Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs can be interesting as well as entertaining on several occasions. However, not many are aware that their ways of entertainment can also be weird habits. A reel on social media has been proving this instance in the most hilarious way possible. The following video shows a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; showcasing many styles of burping that can leave anyone busting a gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Instagram video shows Golden Retriever burping in different ways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;User @daisythegoldiee took to Instagram to share an adorable video of their Golden Retriever dog showing ways to burp. The popular page created by the owner is dedicated to the unmissable moments of the two Golden siblings, &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/176650-dog-car-wash-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daisy and Maple;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Daisy and Maple&lt;/a&gt;. In the above-mentioned viral reel, Maple is seen flaunting her never-seen-before talent of burping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the pooch’s hooman decides to rate her burping skills to appreciate her talent. The first one is a “small but mighty baby Burp” of Maple, which receives a 9 out of 10. Later, the Golden shows her “I smell my own burp” burp, which goes on to receive an 11 out of 10. The next one is “I ate a lot of yoghurt and now I’am really full” burp. This cute burp with a little yoghurt stain on the canine’s nose gets full marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Maple’s “Head Scratchies Burp” scores a 9 out of 10 while “the dainty lady burp” is an 8. Furthermore, the “Huh?. It wasn’t me.” burp receives a 9 as well. The last but not the least is none other than the “multi-tasking burp.” This turns out to be the best burp as the hooman rates it as a 12 out of 10. Maple’s owner, finding joy in the pet’s burps, proves how a dog’s weird habits can also be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, this funny reel has garnered over 20K likes, more than 245K views, and over 3K shares. Users also shared their reactions in the comment section, with one writing, “i like the multi tasking burp.” One more commented, “All of her burps are 100/10.” A third user stated, “I’d like to request more of this series please and thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/180752-golden-retriever-burp-instagram-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever Shows Many Ways To Burp in Cute Video&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 12:22:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1pZERIaGZZblhpbkVfbDhTWVBwRGphNV9pWjRheS0wTnNaRlNkWXRSQWVUdERCMndCaEVmc213RjRKV3ZoeXF4UndLek1nak1OUzRYYUFla19qTlAwSVZxM1c4VkM5OTVEdnFWdC1ZR2lXWl9IM1E</guid></item><item><title>肿瘤学家说，戒烟和喝水：了解降低肾癌风险的8个技巧|健康-印度斯坦时报-印度斯坦时报 | Quit smoking and drink water, says oncologist: Know these 8 tips to reduce kidney cancer risk | Health - Hindustan Times - Hindustan Times</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/quit-smoking-and-drink-water-says-oncologist-know-these-8-tips-to-reduce-kidney-cancer-risk-101750761073508.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk of kidney cancer rises significantly after the age of 40.

As an oncologist, I remind patients frequently that healthy kidneys are a product of diligent care over many years.” &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kidney-cancer-causes-diagnosis-conventional-surgery-drawbacks-emergence-of-breakthrough-surgeries-101694332018631.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kidney cancer: Causes, diagnosis, drawbacks of conventional surgery, breakthrough treatments"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney cancer: Causes, diagnosis, drawbacks of conventional surgery, breakthrough treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Pushpinder Gulia further suggested tips that can reduce the risk of kidney cancer:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Do not smoke at all:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco use remains one of the leading causes of kidney cancer. Even occasional smoking exposes the kidneys to harmful chemicals and impairs blood flow. Quitting tobacco as early as possible can significantly reduce your long-term risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Maintain a healthy weight and stay active:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excess weight is associated with increased risk of kidney tumors, in part through insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. Uncomplicated, regular physical activity like 30 minutes of brisk walking a day can control weight and promote kidney function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Use pain medications with caution:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young adults usually take over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen for headaches or muscle pains. Although infrequent use is usually okay, frequent use or taking it over a long period of time can hurt the kidneys and maybe increase the risk of cancer. Use medicine as recommended and see a doctor if you take it often. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/kidney-cancer-7-lifestyle-mistakes-that-are-damaging-your-kidneys-putting-you-at-risk-of-cancer-101717995677790.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Kidney cancer: 7 lifestyle mistakes that are damaging your kidneys, putting you at risk of cancer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney cancer: 7 lifestyle mistakes that are damaging your kidneys, putting you at risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/13/original/shutterstock_2520614153_1741869613958.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Drink water to keep your kidneys healthy.(Shutterstock)" title="Drink water to keep your kidneys healthy.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Drink water to keep your kidneys healthy.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Keep blood pressure and blood sugar under control:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncontrolled diabetes and high blood pressure are strongly linked with kidney disease and kidney cancer. They can remain undetected in their initial stages, so regular screening is necessary. Controlling them by medicines, diet, and low salt and sugar consumption can safeguard kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Add kidney tests to your check-ups:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've had a good family history of kidney problems or are exposed to chemicals at work, talk to your doctor about adding kidney function tests or imaging scans such as ultrasounds to your regular checkups. Early diagnosis makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Stay well hydrated:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping hydrated aids the kidneys in flushing out waste products well. Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water per day unless you have a medical condition for which your doctor recommends something else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Restrict exposure to toxic chemicals:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with prolonged exposure to industrial chemicals, pesticides, or heavy metals need to take extra precautions with regular screenings. Use protection when working with household or gardening chemicals and attempt to restrict unnecessary exposure. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/are-you-always-stressed-oncologist-says-hypertension-can-cause-kidney-cancer-101749973716264.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="Are you always stressed?

Oncologist says ‘hypertension can cause kidney cancer’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Notice new or unusual symptoms:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms such as unintended weight loss, hematuria, or persistent pain in the back should never be taken lightly, particularly among elders. They could be early symptoms of kidney cancer and need to be evaluated at once by a physician.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

And while much of the focus on extreme heat is the immediate risk to human health, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/20/chronic-heat-exposure-illness/" target="_blank"&gt;chronic heat can cause a range of chronic health problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Days and years of exposure to persistent heat can tax the heart and kidneys, disrupt sleep and challenge our mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CPQMBNYJUJFNZERRDR2DJZCCPQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To protect yourself, give yourself time to acclimatize to the heat and stay hydrated. “The first 10 to 15 days of anyone doing any new activity in a warm environment are really important to progressively and gradually do that. Because you allow your body time to adapt,” said &lt;a href="https://kins.uconn.edu/person/rebecca-stearns/" target="_blank"&gt;Rebecca Stearns&lt;/a&gt;, the chief operating officer of the &lt;a href="https://ksi.uconn.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Korey Stringer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit housed&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at the University of Connecticut dedicated to studying and preventing heatstroke in athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6ND4PWW4X5A7FBZKXWS3SRWZYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Don’t exercise outdoors alone, and learn to recognize the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fextreme-heat%2Fsigns-symptoms%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;signs of heatstroke&lt;/a&gt; in yourself and others. Getting out of the heat, even for a few hours, is &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/413470" target="_blank"&gt;protective during heat waves&lt;/a&gt;. Air conditioning and electric fans can help, but may not always be available, such as during a power outage.

Here, we will explain their study and what the future may hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will also provide tips for reducing heart aging that you can start today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Cancer Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/extracellular-matrix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;extracellular matrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; (ECM) is a network of molecules and minerals that sits between cells. Often referred to as the cell’s “scaffolding,” it plays many vital roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on where in the body it is, it generally provides structural support, stops different tissues from sticking together, enhances cell-to-cell communication, and assists in wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it matter for heart health? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors of the recent paper, which appears in &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Nature" rationale="Highly respected journal,Expert written journal,Peer reviewed journal"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02234-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;, “it is widely acknowledged that the mechanics, organization, and composition of the ECM vary with age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explain that these ECM changes may play a part in the stiffening of the cardiac muscle that occurs as we grow older. Age-related changes trigger so-called cardiac fibroblasts, which can lead to fibrosis: A buildup of connective tissue, as seen in scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although fibrosis is an important function and helps repair heart tissue after damage, when it is uncontrolled, it leads to a stiffer, less flexible ECM. In the case of the heart, this can make it &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00441-016-2431-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;less efficient at pumping blood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the ECM is relatively novel. “Most aging research focuses on how cells change over time,” &lt;a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/new-biomaterial-shows-ageing-in-heart-could-be-reversed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/jennifer-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Jennifer Young&lt;/a&gt;, senior author of the study and assistant professor at the Mechanobiology Institute of the National University of Singapore. “Our study looks instead at the ECM and how changes in this environment affect heart aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help uncover the role of the ECM in heart health, the team designed a new, hi-tech model called DECellularized In Situ Polyacrylamide Hydrogel-ECM hybrid (DECIPHER).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model was created using heart tissue from a rat and a lab-created gel that shares physical properties with ECM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the authors explain, it was unclear whether changes in cell signaling or changes in tissue stiffness were most responsible for age-related declines in heart function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DECIPHER platform solves this problem,” explains &lt;a href="https://www.mbi.nus.edu.sg/student/avery-rui-sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Avery Rui Sun&lt;/a&gt;, first author of the study, in a &lt;a href="https://news.nus.edu.sg/new-biomaterial-shows-ageing-in-heart-could-be-reversed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. He explains how it allows “researchers to independently control the stiffness and the biochemical signals presented to the cells — something no previous system using native tissue has been able to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, they could adjust the model and see what happens when cell signalling occurs as it does in a young heart, but with an older, stiffer ECM. Conversely, they could mimic the biochemical signals of an aged heart with a young, flexible ECM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that “young” cell signaling outweighed the negative effects of the stiffer ECM. In reverse, young cells placed on “aged” ECM showed signs of dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This implies that “the biochemical environment around aged heart cells matters more than stiffness,” explains Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; reached out to &lt;a href="https://vitalsolution.com/interventional-cardiology-a-commitment-to-lifelong-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Nishant Kalra, MD&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist, chief medical officer at VitalSolution — an Ingenovis Health company — who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surface molecules (ligands) found in young heart tissue can prevent the activation of fibrosis-promoting cells, even when the tissue is as stiff as aged heart tissue, which points to new ways to target the extracellular environment to slow heart aging,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human studies next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work provides a platform for identifying molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets to prevent or reverse age-related cardiac dysfunction.

However, there are many science-backed lifestyle changes that will support your heart as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Kalra for some tips on maintaining heart health. “For lifestyle-based prevention of heart aging, the most evidence-based strategies are:”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular aerobic exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adherence to a healthy dietary pattern: &lt;/strong&gt;Emphasize fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium, such as by adopting the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324221" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Mediterranean&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/254836" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;DASH diets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop smoking: &lt;/strong&gt;Tobacco damages blood vessels and increases the risk of heart disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adequate sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for 7–9 hours of quality sleep per night. Sleep deprivation can negatively impact heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weight management: &lt;/strong&gt;Obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress reduction: &lt;/strong&gt;Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“These behaviors,” he continued, “are consistently associated with reduced biological and cardiovascular aging, as shown in large epidemiological studies and supported by the American Heart Association.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also reached out to &lt;a href="https://uk.treated.com/medical-team/dr-daniel-atkinson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Daniel Atkinson, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician from the United Kingdom, working for a private healthcare company called Treated. He also advised reducing alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep it below 14 units (roughly 4–5 drinks) per week, avoid drinking more than 3 drinks in any one session, and give your body (and heart and liver) a break from alcohol for at least one continuous 48-hour period each week.”&lt;br&gt;— Daniel Atkinson, MD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Excess alcohol consumption carries a few health risks,” Atkinson said, “and among these is the effect it can have on raising blood pressure, which elevates your risk of heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained how drinking alcohol in excess can weaken the heart muscles, making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:24:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTGNQNkpoV0Y1TWdSMDlGTUNKem1KcFVQUk0wejlFbXBDT2tZaTU4WXpSN0czTElKQy00MUMtTkdkYzhtVUdnQXZPNzEyWHhrbWRCTmk3ckpwbF80Wk92ODZxelBvQUlvTGp4UEV6cHZwT3pkLUFjbTlNVy02U0FMb1F0MFQ5dVdoVEhDb2h0d1ZnNXhHTV8w</guid></item><item><title>神经科医生说，你可以在20分钟内降低胆固醇、血压和痴呆症的风险- Surrey Live | Neurologist says you can cut cholesterol, blood pressure and dementia risk in 20 minutes - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxOU3dnMWYtLTA5Nmc3QWh0RkthdUJIbzRKZml2ektzMjBoOUpoZ1BsMzFHREszVkNMY2lIakZBSE5Vdm9xUUc1Znk3ZHhrY0FUTXFHNWExd0tvT01MYjJmR2RpMEN5OU50R3JxLVR6MnQ3OUZ6b2dxZzRqOVJNT2dwVzVWMNIBiAFBVV95cUxORHpTWlhjcFhUbXhrZHNMd3JENm5SXzlrUHNPS2FfaFBQeUFQYW5UTFlHZE1JR1NZQmpzVW9ZSS1kV0d6UElsWExadXJ3T1h3aWRJNGkwOG90RlZidHBBZTV1UGZHcV9vc1BSUW9fbGEyTjdHdm1ESHp6T1ItSXhHNjIxZTBaN251?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A professor of neurology says there are steps we can take to support brain health and lower the risk of dementia, as well as reducing cholesterol and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Jonathan Schott, professor of neurology at UCL and chief medical officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, &lt;span&gt;has outlined six easy ways to give your brain a boost this summer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Do something active every day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Go on regular walks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Stay connected&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.

Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Do something active every day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Go on regular walks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Stay connected&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Get your blood pressure checked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keeping an eye on your blood pressure is really important,” says Schott. “We and others have found that it’s your blood pressure in your 30s and your 40s which actually may have the most impact on your brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The professor explains that monitoring blood pressure is important because dementia generally stems from two main causes: neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, with the latter involving damage to the brain’s blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By reducing the blood pressure, we think we’re probably putting less strain on the blood vessels in the brain, which makes them more robust and less likely to get clogged or less likely to burst,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6.

You might have read about her and thought, “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;That’s going to be me when I’m older — I won’t have to care at all about what I eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;!” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If you’ve had your heart set on a culinarily decadent old age, you might want to slow that (dinner) roll. According to medical and nutrition experts, what you eat continues to matter, even in your golden years. In fact, when you’re older, eating well may even matter more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need less of is calories.

She wishes she could shout “fiber, fiber, fiber” from the rooftops. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="recommended daily fiber intake" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommended daily fiber intake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for people aged 60 and older is 30 grams for men and 21 grams for women, but her patients fall short of that goal. “Most Americans don’t get that recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of fiber,” she explained. Seniors can miss out on fibers because of issues including appetite, access to certain foods, fixed incomes and dental health.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/asim-cheema-834684" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Asim Cheema" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://health.usnews.com/doctors/asim-cheema-834684" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Asim Cheema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, who specializes in internal medicine and cardiology, notices both fiber and hydration issues in many patients. “Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation and also raise cholesterol. One thing I see a lot is older adults not drinking enough water. They don’t feel thirsty as often, so it just slips their mind. These are basics that are easy to overlook but really affect how people feel day to day.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Flashpop via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Flashpop via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“I often emphasize that having some healthy fat stores is actually protective as we age," said Dr. Elaine Healy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Next, there’s the issue of protein. As you age, you’re already facing a decrease in muscle mass, and that’s a concern, even if you’ve never been the body-building type. According to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yorktownhealth.com/provider/shawn-george-d-o" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Shawn George" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.yorktownhealth.com/provider/shawn-george-d-o" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Shawn George&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an internal medicine physician, “Loss of muscle can lead to weakness, falls and a decline in mobility. To combat this, protein needs actually increase with age, as it helps maintain muscle mass and strength.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I recommend older patients focus on consuming higher amounts of protein throughout the day, sources like lean meats, eggs, beans and Greek yogurt, spread across meals, rather than relying on just one protein-heavy meal. For someone in their 60s or beyond, aiming for at least 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day is a good target. It’s about making sure the body has the building blocks it needs to stay strong and functional for as long as possible.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Every bite counts, these experts said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.centerwellprimarycare.com/en/doctors/tamea-deshawn-evans-md.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Tamea Evans" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.centerwellprimarycare.com/en/doctors/tamea-deshawn-evans-md.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Tamea Evans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, an internal medicine physician and diabetologist, suggested that seniors should focus on high-impact foods, which she described as those that pack a nutritional punch even in smaller, more senior-friendly sized portions. She used natural peanut butter as an example: “It’s a great source of healthy fats, some sugar, calories, protein, vitamins and minerals, all in one spoonful. The key is choosing foods that are rich in things such as fiber and good fats, so every bite counts.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instead of focusing on weight, focus on strength instead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to nutrition, there’s also the issue of weight. Happily, there might be some good news here from Rao. “Being in shape is actually better for longevity than being skinny,” she said. “As you age, you want to focus on maintaining strength and mobility, rather than just weight. Ensuring that you maintain lean muscle mass is crucial as you age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;““The body may not bounce back like it used to, but it’s still incredibly responsive to care — especially when you give it better fuel.””&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I wouldn’t obsess over the scale, but staying strong matters more than ever,” Burgess said. “It’s less about a goal weight and more about keeping your heart, muscles and joints in tip-top shape.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few more pounds might even be a good idea, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://uhgc.org/team/elaine-healy-md" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Elaine Healy" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://uhgc.org/team/elaine-healy-md" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Elaine Healy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, vice president of medical affairs and medical director at United Hebrew Geriatric Center. “I often emphasize that having some healthy fat stores is actually protective as we age.

I’ve had patients in their 70s and 80s who improved inflammatory markers, cognitive clarity and mobility when they committed to eating more nourishing foods.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ormond agrees, saying, “Your body is still capable of healing and adapting — even in your 70s, 80s or beyond. I’ve seen people feel more alert, sleep better and move with less pain, just from making small nutrition changes. You don’t need a lifetime of perfect eating for it to be worth it. Start now, and you’ll feel the difference.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheema said that the effort will be totally worth it if you start feeling better. “If you start eating more heart-healthy foods, like leafy greens or fish, your brain and blood flow benefit, too. That can keep your memory sharp and help you stay independent longer. So don’t worry if your earlier habits weren’t great before — what you do now still counts. It’s worth the effort at any age.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Eating well leads to feeling good, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Raj Dasgupta" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68498f31e4b0cf5f0c9aa069" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.garagegymreviews.com/author/drraj" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Raj Dasgupta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a quadruple board-certified physician specializing in internal medicine, pulmonology, critical care and sleep medicine, and chief medical adviser for Garage Gym Reviews. “You can feel better, move more easily and even manage chronic conditions more effectively just by improving your eating habits,” he said. “The body may not bounce back like it used to, but it’s still incredibly responsive to care — especially when you give it better fuel.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 11:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPNC1QdEJJYVpOSTkyS1F2RzBvcG9TdmN1QllNcXo1WHJBeER6MXVtYnVSMXZHNXVwdk82emZ4dUUtR090QzFUc1pZZUV1SUZRRk9va1RhQWtDY3J4cW94RE9WOWg5QUFVWFBvRkNzNE9UY1c4dWFCOUlfVFJkWVdJbXZEU2NwejZBU3A0WDQxci02TDhqQkF5Um8xOFjSAaIBQVVfeXFMUFZRbjRmNC1sMzVtNDMxbjdFTEpnNU9mSGk4cVRmZy12QTFTcGpHRGVBT29xRENHUnZlOXl0VE1VdWtfazhaRE1STEpZZUdoUXdLSE5tenFLTW13d1p5c1p1LU9YTVR1ZFpDZDcwMm9OaTB0S1VEWVY1VEFyemVGY0RsRk93SW12TVBKYjNlVnp5eWwtMUhZNElBbThreFRGQnZ3</guid></item><item><title>专家说，这7种微妙的行为可能是伪装的“肥胖症” - HuffPost | Experts Say These 7 Subtle Behaviors Might Be 'Bigorexia' In Disguise - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxOdW9XREFqX3poaGNLRDRXY05FOVUwNGcxR3lzWE81UWRmSzRVWVh5eUNONVNIOVY3WkktSUtJR3Q4Mk1ENmlqanlmMlZsWUFVb1kxbjJaazVyQ2JBd1RzTVdZQlNDd3BjSnY5cXRzTVlYbnZRM01EbjFqV0NJd0ZxbnZod2syMWFyTXlyVWYzTDltbTjSAZgBQVVfeXFMUG1wUmRITGNEOFI2cHBwbHJVSXBVUXpyTEtiZnpWNmoxS08xTHB1WFZ3bk54RHJ0TVBRYzRtdGpNSHB2VGFyd21hOUNZMzE5TVJKTVQtWG5laDd0U2l0aFpsU1hLcUZpbno4NVotZUdvdER4NWVKeGtjMlJIRUxta2ZSVGRoX05GNXNjNzFNZFEtM2xMY0ZIV24?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to body image disorders, the idea of a teenage or young woman probably comes to mind.

Exercising compulsively. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise is, of course, a good thing when done properly and in moderation — it benefits &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart/physical-activity/benefits" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="cardiovascular health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/heart/physical-activity/benefits" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;, mental health, &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="bone health" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/exercise-your-bone-health" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and more. But in folks with bigorexia, exercise can become an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trunzo, if your child is constantly exercising or doing it too frequently, you should take notice. This may look like hours and hours spent at the gym each day or long periods of time in your basement home gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young people struggling with bigorexia tend to turn to certain kinds of exercise, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bigorexia predominantly focuses on musculature and muscle size and muscle gain. So you don’t really see these kids doing long track workouts and running marathons,” explained Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of focusing on stamina or even weight loss, people with bigorexia are trying to develop superhero-like physique, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also might look like guilt when they aren’t at the gym, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Again, physical activity is supposed to be good for our health, but for people with muscle dysmorphia, it becomes a chore, it becomes a preoccupation, and they feel bad and guilty if they’re not at the gym all the time,” Nagata explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the actual exercise, it’s how the exercise makes them feel, Nagata added. If your child is complaining that they feel bad that they didn’t go to the gym today or are overly upset when they miss a workout regimen, take note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Withdrawing from activities they normally like.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Muscle dysmorphia is a mental health condition, so it often leads to disruptions in quality of life, daily functioning,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These young men often become so obsessed with their fitness routine or their eating regimen that it also impacts their social life, their school work or their actual work if they’re in the workforce, Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s generally some sort of impairment in functioning [and] lower quality of life,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may see your loved one withdrawing from things they normally enjoy, whether that’s movie night with their friends or a trip with their cousins. And this is because of issues with their body appearance and what they “need” to do to follow their strict rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Becoming upset if it’s suggested that they break their diet plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with bigorexia often has a preoccupation with dieting and calorie intake, according to Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often they’ll religiously count their calories or their macros in a restrictive way, and even if they’re trying to bulk up, they’ll refuse to eat certain foods if they don’t help build muscle (think of ingredients with high sugar levels).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, they likely have strong food rules that don’t allow for much leeway. And if there is a deviation from their set food plan or ideal caloric intake, they’ll likely get mad or upset, Trunzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the restrictive food days, someone with bigorexia may also allow themselves to have a “cheat day” when they can eat whatever they want, but that is problematic, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s really a lot of overlap with that and binge eating, but it’s just been kind of reclaimed or rebranded in a positive light, but some of the behaviors themselves can still have health risks,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Not eating enough food to fuel their workouts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food is designed to fuel us, and the more you exercise, the more you need to consume. But for someone with bigorexia, their high levels of exercise likely don’t match their pretty normal intake of food, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [food] intake is very, very low, and that leads to the starvation state in bigorexia, some of these individuals may have a ‘normal’ food intake ... but the energy output is often massive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they may be eating a diet that is sufficient for someone who exercises regularly, but not excessively, it’s not enough food for someone who is constantly at the gym. This can have devastating consequences on the body, such as entering into a starvation of malnutrition state, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Darrin Klimek via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Darrin Klimek via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;A young man with bigorexia may spend hours and hours weightlifting to bulk up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Taking lots of supplements and protein powders.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s common for young people with bigorexia to engage in excessive supplement use, which includes taking over-the-counter products from stores like GNC and your local pharmacy, in addition to protein powders, said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these products are legal, as with other &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="supplements in this country" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/fda-101-dietary-supplements" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;supplements in this country&lt;/a&gt;, “most of them are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration,” said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, you can buy them online, you can often buy them at grocery stores or just over the counter, but because of current laws and lack of regulation, actually anything in the supplement category is not really rigorously tested for safety or effectiveness,” Nagata added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These products can be tainted or mislabeled, Nagata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you (or your child) do take supplements, look for USP-certified or NSF-certified products, because this rating guarantees safety, &lt;a href="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8&amp;amp;subId3=xid:fr1750699954074faf" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gina Milano" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://linkedin-learning.pxf.io/c/2706071/449670/8005?subId1=641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fgina-milano-rdn-4615b8b8&amp;amp;subId3=xid:fr1750699954074faf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Gina Milano&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical dietitian at Stanford Health Care in California &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/magnesium-sleep-stress-social-media-trend_l_641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="previously told HuffPost" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="685951fee4b0833f89bf46da" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="641b040de4b0bc5cb653b13f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;previously told HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.

Constantly checking their appearance in the mirror.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirror checking often is associated with eating disorders like anorexia, but is also seen in young men with bigorexia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re always looking at themselves in the mirror, and checking their physical appearance,” said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the occasional peek in the mirror to make sure your hair is in place and your shirt isn’t too wrinkled, instead, it’s obsessively looking in every nearby mirror and reflective surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall, pressure from social media is a big driver of bigorexia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, the average person didn’t have a view into a celebrity’s or influencer’s everyday routine. Aside from movies or print news articles, there wasn’t any more insight into a famous person’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, though, social media gives everyone — kids included — a peek into the exercise routines, food regimens and daily life of rich and famous people. And this only hurts a kid’s body image, both experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The constant bombardment from social media, I think, has been a real driver in the increases that we’re seeing in kids having these issues with body dysmorphic disorder, and specifically with bigorexia,” said Trunzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not realistic to think that your child will be shielded from social media forever, so instead of avoiding the topic, address it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a parent, you want to know what your kid is seeing on social media, what they’re seeing on TV, or what they’re seeing in the movies, and then you want to talk to them about that,” Trunzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Trunzo, you can do this by asking them how they think a certain celebrity looks in a picture. If the child responds with something like, “They look great, I wish I looked like that,” explain to them what goes into these seemingly unposed photos — such as editing, lighting, private chefs, personal trainers and plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s never too early to start having these kinds of discussions with your child, said Trunzo. This way, they’ll understand that what they’re looking at, whether on TikTok or in a movie, isn’t real and isn’t how they should aim to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what to do if a loved one shows any of the above signs of bigorexia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, understand that bigorexia is a serious mental health condition that can cause huge physical and mental health implications, said Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you have concerns, you should get professional help,” Nagata said. Your primary care provider or pediatrician is a good place to start as they can conduct assessments and evaluation, and provide referrals, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think, in general, muscle dysmorphia is — and eating disorders are — best supported by an interdisciplinary team, including a mental health, medical and nutrition provider,” Nagata said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="12"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 Scientists at King’s College London have developed a revolutionary &lt;strong&gt;nanoneedle patch&lt;/strong&gt; that is thinner than a human hair, enabling painless biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;💉 The patch collects detailed &lt;strong&gt;molecular information&lt;/strong&gt; from tissues without cutting or scarring, offering a non-invasive alternative to traditional biopsies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 This innovation could transform &lt;strong&gt;disease diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt; and monitoring, particularly for conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer’s, through real-time molecular analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤝 Developed through interdisciplinary collaboration, the patch promises faster, more accurate medical decisions, heralding a new era of &lt;strong&gt;personalized medicine&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biopsies have long been a necessary but often painful procedure for diagnosing various medical conditions. However, a revolutionary new development from scientists at King’s College London promises to change this narrative. A microscopic patch, bristling with nanoneedles and thinner than a human hair, offers a pain-free alternative to traditional biopsies. This breakthrough could transform how diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s are diagnosed and monitored, eliminating the need for invasive procedures that often involve scalpels and needles. The potential implications for patient care and medical diagnostics are profound and far-reaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Revolutionary Patch: A Leap in Medical Technology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nanoneedle-studded patch represents a significant advancement in medical technology. Unlike traditional biopsies that require removing tissue samples, this patch painlessly collects detailed molecular data from tissues without cutting or scarring. The patch’s nanoneedles are roughly 1,000 times thinner than a human hair, allowing them to extract molecular “fingerprints” such as lipids, proteins, and mRNA directly from living cells. This method offers an unprecedented level of detail and accuracy in molecular diagnostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed through a collaboration involving experts in nanoengineering, clinical oncology, cell biology, and artificial intelligence, this patch could revolutionize personalized medicine. By providing a real-time window into disease progression and treatment response, it allows for more accurate and timely medical decisions. The ability to sample the same tissue multiple times, without destroying it, is a significant advancement over traditional biopsy techniques. This innovation holds promise for improving outcomes for patients with complex conditions like brain cancer and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ZEcurf0NMO"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rudebaguette.com/en/2025/06/quantum-laws-just-got-twisted-u-s-engineers-use-entangled-light-to-project-mind-bending-3d-holograms-in-real-time/"&gt;“Quantum Laws Just Got Twisted”: U.S. Engineers Use Entangled Light to Project Mind-Bending 3D Holograms in Real Time&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Transforming Disease Monitoring and Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implications of this nanoneedle patch extend beyond mere diagnostics. It could fundamentally change how diseases are tracked and treated. By enabling frequent, non-invasive sampling, doctors can make faster, more informed decisions about surgeries and treatment plans. For instance, in brain surgery, the patch allows surgeons to quickly assess molecular data from suspicious areas, enabling more precise and targeted interventions. This capability reduces delays in treatment and improves surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch’s potential for integration into everyday medical devices, such as contact lenses and bandages, further enhances its utility. Manufactured using techniques similar to those used for computer chips, these nanoneedles can be mass-produced, making them accessible for widespread medical use. This innovation could soon bring diagnosis and monitoring directly to the skin’s surface, offering a seamless and efficient way to manage health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Collaborative Efforts and Future Prospects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of this nanoneedle patch is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration. By bringing together experts from various fields, this project has achieved a breakthrough that could redefine medical diagnostics. In preclinical studies, the patch has already demonstrated its effectiveness on brain cancer tissue and mouse models, with promising results that suggest real-world applications are not far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ciro Chiappini, the lead author of the study, emphasizes the patch’s potential to revolutionize disease diagnosis and monitoring. By offering a painless and efficient alternative to traditional biopsies, this technology could significantly improve patient experiences and outcomes. As the patch moves towards clinical application, it holds the promise of transforming how diseases are diagnosed and managed, making personalized medicine a tangible reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A New Era in Painless Diagnostics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction of the nanoneedle patch marks a significant step forward in the quest for painless medical diagnostics. As this technology continues to develop, it could lead to the end of painful biopsies, providing a safer and more comfortable experience for patients. The ability to diagnose and monitor diseases without invasive procedures opens new avenues for medical care and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research, published in Nature Nanotechnology, has garnered attention for its potential to change the landscape of medical diagnostics. By enabling faster and more accurate disease tracking, this technology could help doctors and patients make better, more informed decisions. As we move forward, the question remains: how will this breakthrough in nanotechnology reshape the future of personalized medicine and patient care?&lt;/p&gt;

However, this process can be hindered by chronic stress, poor diet, and lack of proper recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to detox cortisol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;1. Cut back on caffeine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing about excess cortisol is that it creates a “wired but tired” feeling, and can have you reaching for the coffee pot more than usual. This creates a self-sustaining cycle of fatigue, caffeine, stress, and more fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/is-coffee-good-for-you" target="_blank"&gt;Coffee&lt;/a&gt; is a stimulant which will raise cortisol levels,” explains Relf. “This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, however, if we consume it too often and in too large quantities, then it can cause consistently elevated cortisol levels. This can have a knock-on effect on other hormones, creating greater imbalances.” That said, you don’t need to cut it out entirely. Cutting back will have a marked positive effect, as will waiting to &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/when-is-the-right-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;drink caffeine&lt;/a&gt; until after you’ve eaten breakfast. And there are always &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-coffee-alternatives-for-a-healthy-energy-boost" target="_blank"&gt;caffeine alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;2. Incorporate breathwork&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/breathwork-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;Breathwork&lt;/a&gt; activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which can counteract cortisol spikes,” says Dr. Osagie-Clouard. Similarly, practising mindfulness can help to lower the perception of stress, which can shift you from a reactionary state to a responsive one. To get started with breathwork, start by extending your exhale to be longer than your inhale. Or, there’s the “parasympathetic sigh,” which can help facilitate feelings of calm quickly. To do it, breathe in, then take a second sip of air just before you slowly exhale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;3. Move more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular exercise is recommended for almost everyone. The trick with excess cortisol, though, is to make sure the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of exercise you choose doesn’t stress your body out more. “Gentle, consistent activity—like &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/walking-for-longevity" target="_blank"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/yoga-boat-pose" target="_blank"&gt;yoga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/reformer-pilates-guide" target="_blank"&gt;Pilates,&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/all-the-benefits-of-strength-training-for-women" target="_blank"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt;—regulates stress hormones better than high-intensity exercise and overtraining,” says Dr. Osagie-Clouard. So, don’t assume you need to spend hours in the gym. “Exercise has been shown to reduce cortisol levels and improve insulin sensitivity, which is key in the management of PCOS,” says Relf. Forget the idea of a perfect schedule, though. “Any movement is beneficial,” she points out. “So choose consistency over everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;4. Make sleep a priority&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important and powerful things you can do for your body is get enough rest, between six and eight hours a night, as consistent, uninterrupted sleep will help to reset cortisol in the body. There has been some recent discussion about women needing more than eight hours during certain periods of their cycle, but this is yet to reach the mainstream. “Give yourself a regular bedtime and establish an evening routine that helps you unwind and relax in the lead up to bedtime,” suggests Relf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;5. Rethink your nutrition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating in a way that keeps blood sugar stable can help to assuage the stress spikes and troughs associated with excess cortisol. “Think protein, fiber, and healthy fats,” recommends Dr. Osagie-Clouard. There are also &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/foods-that-naturally-lower-cortisol" target="_blank"&gt;cortisol-lowering foods&lt;/a&gt; to incorporate into your diet. This could look like pairing fruit with yogurt and seeds or nuts. Or, popping some peanut butter on a rice cake. The added fiber and fat will help slow down the absorption of carbohydrates and cause a smaller sugar spike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vogue.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFAydXc4ZUN1T0xTbUpHY3pRSTNmd0NqTC1ZU1R4blBXVkpyUEY3TnFZeVZKZEVSdTVEUzJJN3dLN3RNMlNoU1NLWHdLRUFyc09BTmxlbDY4djJlQXN0Zk5DM2E3eVpzajZGakZR</guid></item><item><title>多少酒精可以缩短您的寿命？科学家揭示了令人震惊的数字-印度时报 | How much alcohol can shorten your life?

Far from being harmless in moderation, drinking—whether casually or regularly—has been shown to significantly shorten life expectancy and increase cancer risk. In a study published in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, lead researcher Dr. Tim Stockwell and his colleagues concluded that even small amounts of alcohol can be harmful. Dr. Stockwell later told the Daily Mail that as little as two drinks per week may shave off several days from your life, while regular drinking could cost you years. This shift in understanding is not only scientific but cultural, challenging decades of messaging that moderate drinking, particularly wine, might be good for your heart or longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New research quantifies how alcohol consumption shortens your lifespan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tim Stockwell, a leading researcher in alcohol studies, has drawn attention to just how sharply alcohol impacts longevity. In media interviews following the study, he provided estimates that frame alcohol's toll in tangible terms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just 2 drinks per week might cut life expectancy by 3 to 6 days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consuming 7 drinks a week essentially one per day could cost you 2.5 months of life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 35 drinks per week, the average individual could lose up to 2 years from their lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are based on population averages, meaning the actual impact on an individual can vary depending on genetics, health and other habits. Still, the risk is clear. The new findings undermine earlier beliefs that a little alcohol may be protective, particularly for heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they highlight a consistent dose-response relationship. The more you drink, the higher your risk of early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding alcohol’s link to cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol’s role in causing cancer is now well-established in scientific literature. Dr. Helen Croker, Assistant Director of Research and Policy at the WCRF, explains that alcohol is metabolised into acetaldehyde, a toxic compound that directly damages DNA. This leads to mutations and increases the risk of developing several types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Particularly vulnerable organs and tissues include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mouth and throat due to direct exposure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Liver the main organ for detoxifying alcohol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Colon and rectum especially at higher intake levels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Harriet Rumgay from the WHO, men who drink two pints per day face:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;  A 38% greater risk of colorectal cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A 94% increase in the risk of mouth or throat cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An 84% higher risk of liver cancer.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even drinking at the so-called “moderate” level of one drink per day has been associated with a 17% increased risk of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How much is too much?

Men who believe they are safe because they only drink on weekends are often still over the risk thresholds, especially when binge-drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Debunking the red wine health myth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, red wine has enjoyed a reputation as the “healthy alcohol” thanks to its polyphenol content, particularly resveratrol, thought to support cardiovascular health. However, researchers like Dr. Croker clarify that these benefits do not outweigh the harms of alcohol itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the same polyphenols in red wine are found in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grapes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green tea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the plant compounds are beneficial, consuming them through alcoholic drinks defeats the purpose. The WCRF now recommends avoiding alcohol altogether, including red wine, for those concerned about cancer or long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The negative impact of alcohol far outweighs any perceived cardiovascular benefits,” says Dr. Croker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why men struggle more with cutting down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social norms and peer pressure play a significant role in male drinking habits. According to research by Professor Richard Cooke from Staffordshire University, men are less likely to think about their health and often feel pressured to match their friends’ drinking habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 WCRF survey found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25% of men feel judged or “boring” when they refuse drinks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 in 5 men has called in sick after weekday drinking (vs. 1 in 10 women)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;50% of men use excuses not to drink rather than openly declining&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooke’s advice includes setting personal motivations for cutting back, such as wanting to feel mentally sharper, avoiding hangovers or being a better role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter strategies for moderation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of quitting entirely, many men may benefit from mindful drinking.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A leading nutritionist has warned how you brew your coffee could raise your risk of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; But, on the other hand, she added, coffee also contains 'fat-soluble diterpenes' that raise both cancer and heart disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because diterpenes are known to increase bad cholesterol 'in just a few weeks'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Bad' cholesterol, or LDL, is a fatty substance that builds up in blood vessels, interfering with blood flow to and from the heart, and raising the risk of damage to the organ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Traditional paper drip and instant cold brew are both filtered brewing methods she recommended that can lower your risk of cancers and heart trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They trap diterpenes essentially eliminating their negative effects whilst still preserving beneficial polyphenols,' she explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she warned against methods that use equipment containing harmful microplastics that can also work their way into your coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Hot water to plastic will accelerate the release of microplastics into your beverage, as well as your plastic associated chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'So if you are going to do filtered coffee, pour over is probably your best bet. Doing something into a glass container and not having hot water touch plastic,' she added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Unfiltered methods have been linked to cancer risk as it increases the chance harmful compounds can find their way into your cup &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The nutritionist also advised against using a french press, or any method that involves pouring boiling water over fresh coffee grounds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She warned of similar risks of using popular espresso pods, explaining how chemicals are released when hot water runs through them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Patrick's warning comes after scientists discovered too much instant coffee could increase the risk of some types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's because the popular caffeinated drink contains twice as much acrylamide than ground coffee — a chemical substance produced when some food, including coffee beans, is cooked at high temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The product has been declared as a 'problem human carcinogen' by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning there is evidence the chemical could cause cancer in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory tests revealed acrylamide in the diet causes lung and reproductive cancers in animals and scientists agree that it has the potential for similar effects in humans, according to the Food Standards Agency (FSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Polish study from 2013 that analysed 42 samples of coffee, including ten instant coffees, revealed instant coffee had double the amount of acrylamide than freshly ground coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, you would need to drink about ten cups of instant coffee a day for your intake of acrylamide to become a concern, according to researchers at McGill University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some 80 per cent of UK households buy instant coffee, particularly those aged over 65, according to research by the British Coffee Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

So it helps to keep stepping up your workouts to get the best results. “With all exercise, as your body adapts to the movement, it requires an increase in intensity and effort to continually progress,” Ellis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Looking to take your walking workouts to the next level? Here’s what trainers recommend, plus why walking is so good for you in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-is-walking-so-good-for-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is walking so good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A flood of recent research has linked regular walks to impressive health benefits. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/23/bjsports-2022-105669" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:British Journal of Sports Medicine;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; analysis of data from more than 30 million people found that those who did 75 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking) per week had a 23% lower risk of dying early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another study, this one published in &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00755-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Lancet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, tracked 700 adults with lower back pain for three years. The researchers found that those who were asked to follow a walking program for six months had fewer issues with back pain returning and more time between back pain flares than those who didn’t follow a walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walking can even support your mood. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Psychiatry;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; study found that walking for an hour a day can reduce the risk of depression by 26%. “It also strengthens your muscles and bones and decreases the risks of chronic diseases too,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-make-your-walks-more-challenging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make your walks more challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny stresses that any walks is better than none, especially if your activity level is currently lower than you’d prefer. But if you’re ready to kick the intensity up a notch, experts recommend doing these modifications to make your walking workouts more challenging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="push-the-pace"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push the pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s easy to get content with moving at whatever speed feels good to you. But if you feel comfortable at your current pace, it’s time to take things to the next level. “Increasing your pace will make it more challenging,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny suggests moving at a speed where you start to breathe more heavily and trying to maintain that. Taking &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/walk-faster-10-tips-picking-115102236.html" data-ylk="slk:shorter steps rather than longer strides;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;shorter steps rather than longer strides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bending your elbows to about 90 degrees and pumping your arms for momentum, can help you maintain a faster clip. Once you feel good at faster speeds, he suggests that you push the pace to the point where you could almost break into a jog, while still sticking with a low-impact workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can also track your speed with a fitness app to keep tabs on your progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-interval-workouts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do interval workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interval training simply means alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity activity in a workout. “Interval training gives your body an opportunity to push itself while allowing for proper recovery in between intervals,” Ellis says. By keeping your body “guessing,” it can help to improve your fitness and calorie burn, Matheny says. “This is a great way to incorporate a low-impact ‘high-intensity interval training,’” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a few ways to approach this. One is that you can simply move faster during your walks for a certain period of time, like a minute or two, before slowing down to recover and then speeding up again. But Matheny says you can also incorporate things like step-ups on a park bench during your walks to help quickly increase your heart rate, before continuing with your walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="add-more-distance--but-not-too-much-at-once"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more distance — but not too much at once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just like any form of exercise, ramping up the intensity or distance too fast raises the risk of injury. “Ten thousand steps a day is the sweet spot,” Pack says. “But for someone who may only be at 3,000 steps a day, they can gradually add more distance over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She suggests adding an additional 1,000 steps a week until you hit your target step count. “Maybe the first goal is to hit 4,000 a day for a week; then 5,000 the next week,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="use-weights--but-not-hand-weights"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use weights — but not hand weights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny recommends adding weights to your walks to push yourself “after you feel like you can't walk any faster.” But experts agree that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/should-you-be-wearing-a-weighted-vest-on-your-daily-walks-100017788.html" data-ylk="slk:a weighted vest is a better option;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a weighted vest is a better option&lt;/a&gt; than using hand weights. “Hand weights can throw off your normal walking gait,” raising the risk of injury, Matheny explains. “It doesn’t give you a good arm workout either,” he adds. Pack agrees. “A vest gives equal weight distribution; hand weights may not and could be harder on joints,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many weighted vests allow you to add more weights over time to increase the intensity, giving you plenty of mileage out of this investment. “Wearing a weighted vest and adding resistance is a great option to challenge your body during walks,” Ellis says. “That improves bone density and strengthens your core musculature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="crank-up-the-incline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crank up the incline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is easier if you’re on a treadmill, but you can also walk up hills outside. Walking on an incline “will increase your heart rate and can incorporate more glutes and hamstring involvement,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re on a treadmill, she recommends walking at different inclines to switch up the challenge. So that could mean walking at an incline of five, before switching to eight and then back to five, all in the same workout. For outdoor walks, that may simply mean finding a hilly route near you, Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, trainers stress the importance of keeping things fresh to get the most out of your walking workouts. “Challenge yourself,” Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2gFBVV95cUxQUV82eE9rbmtLY0F1WVFCQVFHcWZjeGt2RThaV09scU9XTVVMVFdXTnlla2swSHZBVDZGSWhTcW95cTZCc05IMkMwLVNaU0VINEppeXRiZW03bFoycTh5UmpzT1cxMXNDMzNzcE16MTdoMWNRZEl1bXdZU3hxZ05LaTJtRTBzV1lzNXhVYzBrMWpZSTYtT3dKdUl0eXNFeWZ5SHZaT0ZPWVZIZlpiYkdiaEpjNk1KdWJZMVJpc0pGQUNfM2U1M1hZYmdzZDYtSkxsS05NUVlGRG5kQQ</guid></item><item><title>穿加重背心，增加斜坡等：让步行更具挑战性的5个技巧-雅虎 | Wear a weighted vest, add an incline and more: 5 tips to make your walks more challenging - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNNHNIZnhKZXdnaDIzc1ZwdHlUY3BiaUxRZGpGeVZPazlBQ0xUbXYyTElPVXB5ODZLb182SzNqSks4WWY4OVQyVjh2dHgwRjB0N1pReXYwMk84QkJ2bXYteTljUExLVWtoZk9hNFQxMGtCNEdDSlRoZU1DRnFDTFdadmxRQ0hXSWFoVkN0T0N3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Few forms of exercise have exploded in popularity over the past few years like &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/health-benefits-taking-long-walk-110051600.html" data-ylk="slk:walking workouts;cpos:1;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;walking workouts&lt;/a&gt;.

Here’s what trainers recommend, plus why walking is so good for you in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="why-is-walking-so-good-for-you"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is walking so good for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A flood of recent research has linked regular walks to impressive health benefits. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/early/2023/01/23/bjsports-2022-105669" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:British Journal of Sports Medicine;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; analysis of data from more than 30 million people found that those who did 75 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like brisk walking) per week had a 23% lower risk of dying early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Another study, this one published in &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(24)00755-4/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the Lancet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;the Lancet&lt;/a&gt;, tracked 700 adults with lower back pain for three years. The researchers found that those who were asked to follow a walking program for six months had fewer issues with back pain returning and more time between back pain flares than those who didn’t follow a walking routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Walking can even support your mood. A &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link " href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2720689" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:JAMA Psychiatry;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;JAMA Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; study found that walking for an hour a day can reduce the risk of depression by 26%. “It also strengthens your muscles and bones and decreases the risks of chronic diseases too,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-make-your-walks-more-challenging"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make your walks more challenging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny stresses that any walks is better than none, especially if your activity level is currently lower than you’d prefer. But if you’re ready to kick the intensity up a notch, experts recommend doing these modifications to make your walking workouts more challenging:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="push-the-pace"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push the pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s easy to get content with moving at whatever speed feels good to you. But if you feel comfortable at your current pace, it’s time to take things to the next level. “Increasing your pace will make it more challenging,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny suggests moving at a speed where you start to breathe more heavily and trying to maintain that. Taking &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/walk-faster-10-tips-picking-115102236.html" data-ylk="slk:shorter steps rather than longer strides;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;shorter steps rather than longer strides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as bending your elbows to about 90 degrees and pumping your arms for momentum, can help you maintain a faster clip. Once you feel good at faster speeds, he suggests that you push the pace to the point where you could almost break into a jog, while still sticking with a low-impact workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You can also track your speed with a fitness app to keep tabs on your progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-interval-workouts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do interval workouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Interval training simply means alternating between low-intensity and high-intensity activity in a workout. “Interval training gives your body an opportunity to push itself while allowing for proper recovery in between intervals,” Ellis says. By keeping your body “guessing,” it can help to improve your fitness and calorie burn, Matheny says. “This is a great way to incorporate a low-impact ‘high-intensity interval training,’” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There are a few ways to approach this. One is that you can simply move faster during your walks for a certain period of time, like a minute or two, before slowing down to recover and then speeding up again. But Matheny says you can also incorporate things like step-ups on a park bench during your walks to help quickly increase your heart rate, before continuing with your walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="add-more-distance--but-not-too-much-at-once"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add more distance — but not too much at once&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Just like any form of exercise, ramping up the intensity or distance too fast raises the risk of injury. “Ten thousand steps a day is the sweet spot,” Pack says. “But for someone who may only be at 3,000 steps a day, they can gradually add more distance over time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;She suggests adding an additional 1,000 steps a week until you hit your target step count. “Maybe the first goal is to hit 4,000 a day for a week; then 5,000 the next week,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="use-weights--but-not-hand-weights"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use weights — but not hand weights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Matheny recommends adding weights to your walks to push yourself “after you feel like you can't walk any faster.” But experts agree that &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/should-you-be-wearing-a-weighted-vest-on-your-daily-walks-100017788.html" data-ylk="slk:a weighted vest is a better option;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;a weighted vest is a better option&lt;/a&gt; than using hand weights. “Hand weights can throw off your normal walking gait,” raising the risk of injury, Matheny explains. “It doesn’t give you a good arm workout either,” he adds. Pack agrees. “A vest gives equal weight distribution; hand weights may not and could be harder on joints,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many weighted vests allow you to add more weights over time to increase the intensity, giving you plenty of mileage out of this investment. “Wearing a weighted vest and adding resistance is a great option to challenge your body during walks,” Ellis says. “That improves bone density and strengthens your core musculature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="crank-up-the-incline"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crank up the incline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This is easier if you’re on a treadmill, but you can also walk up hills outside. Walking on an incline “will increase your heart rate and can incorporate more glutes and hamstring involvement,” Pack says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re on a treadmill, she recommends walking at different inclines to switch up the challenge. So that could mean walking at an incline of five, before switching to eight and then back to five, all in the same workout. For outdoor walks, that may simply mean finding a hilly route near you, Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, trainers stress the importance of keeping things fresh to get the most out of your walking workouts. “Challenge yourself,” Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 09:00:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxNNHNIZnhKZXdnaDIzc1ZwdHlUY3BiaUxRZGpGeVZPazlBQ0xUbXYyTElPVXB5ODZLb182SzNqSks4WWY4OVQyVjh2dHgwRjB0N1pReXYwMk84QkJ2bXYteTljUExLVWtoZk9hNFQxMGtCNEdDSlRoZU1DRnFDTFdadmxRQ0hXSWFoVkN0T0N3</guid></item><item><title>我听说收据有毒。触摸它们是否安全？ -《纽约时报》 | I’ve Heard Receipts Are Toxic.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The social media platform TikTok recently banned a hashtag called #SkinnyTok after European regulators warned it was promoting &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/28/1263527105/steroids-men-body-image" target="_blank"&gt;unrealistic body images &lt;/a&gt;and extreme weight loss.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company had seen an onslaught of content featuring emaciated-looking young women peddling tips on how to drop weight quickly.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now the hashtag may be gone, but eliminating this kind of harmful content is not that simple. There's still no shortage of people — on TikTok and other social media platforms — spreading unhealthy information on how to eat fewer calories and get very, very thin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that consuming this type of content on social media &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5003636/" target="_blank"&gt;is correlated to&lt;/a&gt; a higher risk of disordered eating. Young women and girls are especially vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But when it comes to nutrition and wellness, it can be hard to disentangle the unhealthy from the healthy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"You have many kinds of content in the gray zones," says &lt;a href="https://www.brookeduffy.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Brooke Erin Duffy&lt;/a&gt;, who studies social media and culture at Cornell University. "Their regulation is much more difficult."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Creators are good at taking advantage of this murky ground, says Duffy. "As soon as there is an attempt for platforms to regulate or thwart a hashtag, anyone using the platform is gonna develop a workaround," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A popular meme called "What I eat in a day," for example, features people showing their daily food intake. Posts can either feature a balanced diet or one that could put someone in a dangerous calorie deficit. One young woman recently posted a video showing the single croissant she subsisted on in a day, whereas a different woman featured a balance of lean proteins and vegetables adding up to 1,800 calories.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Body-positive counterprogramming&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some creators on the front lines of the body image battle are making their own counterprogramming. Athlete and creator Kate Glavan — who has nearly 150,000 followers — urges her followers to take seriously the dangers of content that glamorizes undernourishment.  She discusses her own struggle with an eating disorder in her videos.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"A lot of creators are explicitly promoting anorexia to their audience," Glavan says in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kateglavan/video/7380018730572451115" target="_blank"&gt;a recent TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;. "It's dangerous. It's misinformed," she says, and she advises people to "block these creators."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Research shows that anorexia has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8429328/" target="_blank"&gt;the highest mortality rate&lt;/a&gt; of any psychiatric disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But researchers who study this issue say &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/17/1196978085/nprs-book-of-the-day-draft-10-17-2023" target="_blank"&gt;body-positive content&lt;/a&gt; doesn't garner the same kinds of audiences — or profit. "Negative images that are unrealistic or show really thin people or really muscular people tend to have a more lasting impact than body-positive content&lt;strong&gt;," &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrisci.med.utoronto.ca/faculty/amanda-raffoul" target="_blank"&gt;says Amanda Raffoul,&lt;/a&gt; who researches eating disorders and social media at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Messaging that equates thinness with beauty is reinforced throughout society, Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul points to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1471015323000223" target="_blank"&gt; research that suggests&lt;/a&gt; consumption of body-positive content on social media does not necessarily provide protection against or counteract content that promotes unrealistic beauty standards or weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The way that they structure content and the way that they code algorithms to amplify certain types of messaging and even target certain types of messaging to specific users puts that information in the hands of more vulnerable people," Raffoul says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even though platforms aren't creating content, says Raffoul, they are responsible for how &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/17/1224955473/social-media-algorithm-filterworld" target="_blank"&gt;aggressively they amplify&lt;/a&gt; different kinds of messaging or direct it at certain demographics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;TikTok declined a request for an interview for this story, but in an emailed statement stressed that they "regularly review safety measures to address evolving risks and have blocked search results for #skinnytok since it has become linked to unhealthy weight loss content." Searches on the platform for this term are redirected to the &lt;a href="https://www.allianceforeatingdisorders.com/" target="_blank"&gt;National Alliance for Eating Disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among other safety strategies, the company says it continues to restrict videos for teen accounts and redirect searches to health experts, as well as partner with advocacy groups that offer strategies around recognizing and treating eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A losing battle&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some body-positive warriors say the movement is having a low moment. "With the massive &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/13/1198912257/weight-loss-drugs-ozempic-hollywood-body-positvity-future-us-obesity-shortage" target="_blank"&gt;rise of GLP-1 drugs&lt;/a&gt; and their widespread use as a quick fix weight loss solution, we've seen this return of the narrative that thin is back in," says &lt;a href="https://www.meganjaynecrabbe.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Megan Jayne Crabbe,&lt;/a&gt; author of the recently published book &lt;em&gt;We Don't Make Ourselves Smaller Here. "&lt;/em&gt;The beauty standard has swung back towards extreme slimness," Crabbe says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;While Crabbe still creates content on social media, she says it's harder to break through with messaging that normalizes bigger bodies than it was a few years ago. She is glad to see #Skinnytok banned, but she says she sees a need for more soul searching on the question of beauty standards from Western culture.  "I think banning the hashtag is a surface-level plaster to a very deep wound," she says. "We are still deeply fat phobic as a society."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some content creators say the uphill battle against negative content around eating and skinny bodies is exhausting. "I don't really claim it anymore," says &lt;a href="https://the-dots.com/users/nyome-nicholas-williams-77718" target="_blank"&gt;Nyome Nicholas-Williams,&lt;/a&gt; of the term "body positivity." Nicholas-Williams — a Black woman and a plus-size model — says she feels pushed out of the movement that Black women started but she says has since &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9589104/#s3" target="_blank"&gt;been co-opted&lt;/a&gt;. "I'm more of like 'body neutrality,'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2020, Nicholas-Williams &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/25/instagram-row-over-plus-size-model-forces-change-to-nudity-policy" target="_blank"&gt;publicly took on&lt;/a&gt; the social media platform Instagram, accusing the company of censoring content featuring Black plus-size models with different standards than those it used to police content featuring white, slim people. The company issued an apology and pledged to change its policies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nicholas-Williams says some of her public criticism of the social media platform has likely cost her business, but she thinks speaking out against dangerous content is an important strategy in combating it.  "People speaking up and being brave," she says, "that's what it takes."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul, who studies nutrition and social media at the University of Toronto, says the profit should not be overlooked. "Every second, every minute that we spend on these platforms is being monetized," says Raffoul, who points out that eating disorders and ideals around unattainable thinness have been around for decades, but that social media platforms allow for a new delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Raffoul believes it will take lawmakers forcing change in order to create meaningful protection from dangerous content through these new channels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Until that happens, she says, the best strategy to combat it is not to look at it at all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Debunking a common fear about kids’ vaccines - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxOeFJiaGw2YVBRcWNHRFFJVDlXZUhxc1hwMnJ2Y2p5RW5uNGJrcTFoMnFPSmdHampMRmVjNTk1Q0NaMnM0YUs4VWZKNTg1b2kwMHd5aHdiQWtsdktRdVVuZERFSUk4ODVXWDJGS2UzcjR3bGZIdUNBS1dRTzl6ZTNjaEZZZk9oNjhBcmFPcS1FZXFmX2ZMdFFnMXJpN2pJVHZfTFNWZUllY0x2LVE3LXoyREVn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, a typical child was recommended to receive 11 vaccine doses — seven injections and four oral. Today, that number has risen to 50 to 54 doses by age 18, depending on whether one or two flu shots are given in the first eligible year, and on a few product- and age-specific factors that determine whether a child receives two or three HPV doses, three or four Hib doses, or two or three rotavirus doses. That’s a substantial increase in the number of shots, which is why some are alarmed by the idea of “too many, too soon.” But the science should offer worried parents a great deal of comfort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an infectious diseases physician who directs an antibiotic stewardship program, I’m constantly weighing the benefits and risks of medical interventions — much like  parents weighing vaccine decisions for their children. And as a parent of two young kids myself, I understand why parents don’t want their children to receive anything that isn’t clearly indicated, and I share that commitment to evidence-based decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, when parents ask me whether their kids are getting too many vaccines I take the question seriously and look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And those data reveal one of the most striking paradoxes in modern medicine, something that most people — including many health care providers — don’t know: Despite this significant increase in injections, today’s vaccines expose children to a fraction of the immune-stimulating material that previous generations encountered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To understand why, we need to know what antigens are. An antigen is any protein or molecule that your immune system recognizes as foreign. When you get a vaccine, the antigens in it teach your immune system to identify and fight specific diseases. Think of antigens as the “mug shots” your immune system uses to recognize threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hundred years ago, children received exactly one vaccine: smallpox. That single shot contained approximately 200 different antigens. Today’s &lt;em&gt;entire&lt;/em&gt; pediatric schedule exposes a child to about 165 — a fraction of the more than 3,200 in a single 1980s pertussis shot.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In 1986, children received vaccines protecting against seven diseases. Those vaccines exposed them to over 3,200 antigens — mostly from a single shot of whole-cell DTP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) that contained roughly every protein the pertussis bacterium could produce.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today’s expanded schedule protects against 16-18 diseases, but the total antigen count is about 165. That’s about a 95% reduction in antigen exposure, thanks to precision engineering that strips vaccines down to only the components necessary for protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t theoretical. Vaccine expert Paul Offit and colleagues &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11773551/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;calculated&lt;/a&gt; that a baby could theoretically respond to 10,000 vaccines simultaneously before using even one percent of circulating B-cells. The real-world schedule barely registers on the immune system’s capacity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 1986, we’ve added vaccines against diseases that were killing and disabling thousands of children annually. Hib was the &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-hib-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;leading cause of meningitis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7336a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;severe bloodstream infections&lt;/a&gt; in infants. After conjugate vaccines were introduced for all infants in 1990, the disease was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7336a4.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;virtually eliminated&lt;/a&gt; within a few years. Hepatitis B vaccination began in 1991 and has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/evidence-to-recommendations/hepb-adults-etr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly eradicated childhood liver infections&lt;/a&gt; that can lead to cancer decades later. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines introduced in 2000 &lt;a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.laneproxy.stanford.edu/book/9780323790581/plotkins-vaccines" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;slashed rates of bloodstream infections and pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; in toddlers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7331a2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that vaccinating children born from 1994 through 2023 will prevent approximately 508 million illnesses, 32 million hospitalizations, and 1.13 million deaths, resulting in $540 billion in direct savings and $2.7 trillion in societal costs. Each additional vaccine underwent rigorous testing and addressed a real public health need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some who believe in the “too many, too soon” canard might say that the problem isn’t the antigens but the aluminum. But that fear is unfounded, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aluminum salts have enhanced vaccine effectiveness since the 1930s, with doses tightly regulated by the FDA at no more than 0.85 mg per shot. In 1986, children received a total of about &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1.5 mg of aluminum&lt;/a&gt; through their first six months from vaccines (the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine). Today, they &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;receive&lt;/a&gt; approximately 4.4 mg by 6 months and about 6 mg by age 2 — a modest increase over nearly 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, formula-fed infants ingest about &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;38 mg of aluminum&lt;/a&gt; in their first six months, though only about 1% is absorbed. Furthermore, well over half the aluminum from vaccines clears through healthy kidneys within days, more than 70% by two weeks, with the remainder eliminated over months in people with normal kidney function. While it’s true that aluminum from vaccines enters the bloodstream more directly than aluminum from food (most of which is not absorbed), the body &lt;a href="https://x.com/jakescottMD/status/1935034952674099481" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;processes it the same way&lt;/a&gt;. Once in the blood, aluminum binds to proteins like transferrin and is filtered by the kidneys, regardless of how it entered. Reassuringly, studies show that routine vaccination does not increase total blood aluminum levels, and total lifetime exposure from vaccines remains far lower than from diet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many newer vaccines contain zero aluminum: rotavirus, chickenpox, meningococcal conjugates, annual influenza, and mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, as well as RSV prevention shots, which are not technically vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mismatch between perception and reality isn’t surprising. Going from about a dozen shots to over 50 feels overwhelming. Parents experiene more office visits and naturally assume a greater biological burden. Of course, some parents’ hesitation isn’t rooted in politics or science. It’s the emotional weight of watching their children cry, or their own fear of needles. Those feelings are entirely human. But knowing what today’s vaccines actually contain — and what they prevent — can help put that discomfort in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Medical training doesn’t help. Most physicians learn about vaccine schedules but not the underlying immunology. We’re taught to recommend vaccines, not to explain why a 1980s pertussis shot contained about 20 times more antigens than today’s entire schedule.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The public health community bears responsibility, too. We’ve focused on vaccine safety and effectiveness — both crucial — while neglecting to communicate the engineering advances that make modern vaccines so precise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution isn’t to dismiss parental concerns but to arm families with actual data. The CDC lists vaccine ingredients online, but this information is often technical or not prominently displayed, making it hard for most parents to easily access or understand. Putting plain-language antigen and aluminum content directly on vaccine information sheets would cost little and build trust through transparency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Innovation continues. Researchers are developing adjuvants using saponins, synthetic molecules, and emulsions that could eliminate aluminum entirely while maintaining vaccine effectiveness. Combination vaccines already reduce both needle sticks and total adjuvant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The numbers tell a remarkable story. Children today receive roughly four to five times as many shots as their 1986 counterparts, yet are exposed to 95% fewer antigens and only modest increases in aluminum. We’ve achieved far more protection with far less immune burden through decades of scientific precision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a medical success story; it’s a lesson in how perception can diverge from reality. When parents see more visits and more needles, their instinct to worry is natural and understandable. But when we look at what actually matters to the immune system — the biological load, not the injection count — the data are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an era when medical misinformation spreads faster than the diseases vaccines prevent, transparency has become our most powerful tool. Show people that a single 1980s pertussis shot contained more antigens than today’s entire schedule, and watch skepticism transform into understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

Research suggested that regular use of certain types of commonly-prescribed drugs used to treat bladder conditions, Parkinson's disease and depression, could significantly increase the risk of dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, carried out by experts from the University of Nottingham and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), found that there was nearly a 50% increased risk of dementia among patients aged 55 and over who had used strong anticholinergic medication daily for three years or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Society, when the study came out, commented: "Our own researchers have already shown a strong link between anticholinergic drugs and risk of dementia. This study builds on this information, showing that long-term, high-dose use increases risk of some dementias, particularly vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"A shortcoming of this type of study is that from this information we can't rule out whether the diseases that cause dementia might have already begun in the brains of people involved before they started taking these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; "Current guidelines for doctors say that anticholinergic drugs should be avoided for frail older people because of their impact on memory and thinking, but doctors should consider these new findings for all middle aged and older people as long-term use could raise the risk of dementia."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anticholinergic medications aid in the contraction and relaxation of muscles. They function by inhibiting acetylcholine, a chemical that transmits messages within the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These drugs are prescribed by doctors to treat a range of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bladder issues, allergies, gastrointestinal disorders, and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These medicines can have short-term side effects, such as confusion and memory loss, but it is less clear whether long-term use increases the risk of dementia. The research, led by Professor Carol Coupland from the University's Division of Primary Care and published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, examined the medical records of 58,769 patients diagnosed with dementia and 225,574 patients without a dementia diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All patients were aged 55 and over and registered with UK GPs contributing data to the QResearch database, between 1 January 2004 and 31 January 2016. This study was first reported on in 2019.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings of the study indicated increased risks of dementia for anticholinergic drugs overall and specifically for the anticholinergic antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs, antiparkinsons drugs, bladder drugs and epilepsy drugs after accounting for other risk factors for dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No increased risks were found for the other types of anticholinergic drug studied such as antihistamines and gastrointestinal drugs. This study provides further evidence that doctors should be careful when prescribing certain drugs that have anticholinergic properties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it's important that patients taking medications of this kind don't just stop them abruptly as this may be much more harmful. If patients have concerns, then they should discuss them with their doctor to consider the pros and cons of the treatment they are receiving.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Professor Tom Dening, Head of the Centre for Dementia at the University of Nottingham and a member of the research study teamThe 58,769 patients with dementia had an average age of 82 and 63% were women.

&lt;p&gt;Most of us, in the modern world, make countless decisions in our daily lives without much thought, and for good reason. We don’t have the ability — the time or energy necessary — to devote ourselves to fact-checking every decision that we make. Is the tap water safe to drink, or to shower in, today? We assume that it is without bothering to check. Is your seat belt fastened when you get into the car? If it isn’t, a sensor will alert you, reminding you incessantly to buckle it. Is the air safe to breathe? Is there an extreme weather event that threatens you today? Is your friend who you’re going to go meet about to infect you with a contagious disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We assume that these aren’t real worries and that everything will turn out fine. (And this is okay, in most cases they will.) And yet, the only reason that we can make those assumptions is because somewhere, over long periods of time, responsible adults have done the work necessary to ensure that these mundane, everyday activities aren’t going to pose threats to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The EPA, FDA, and Department of Agriculture have long monitored the air and water quality, ensuring that they’re safe for humans, and issue alerts, warning residents in real-time, if they are not.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has long overseen seat belt safety and regulations in the USA, ensuring compliance with modern vehicle safety practices.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The National Weather Service, run through the USA’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has long monitored the country, coasts, and planet for extreme weather events, sending out alerts, warnings, and recommended courses of action to residents in afflicted areas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And the Centers for Disease Control, run through the USA’s Department of Health and Human Services, has long monitored the spread of disease and infection throughout the country, identifying outbreaks and working to stifle their spread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet much of this (and similar) work — work conducted by bona fide experts over many decades — is being or has already been undone, in favor of allowing individuals to fend for themselves, make their own decisions, and do their own research about life-and-death matters like public health, public safety, and issues that affect the long-term future of the planet. The truth is not that &lt;a href="https://www.freethink.com/opinion/consensus"&gt;consensus undermines science&lt;/a&gt;, but rather that our modern rejection of expertise, and our newfound embracing of the “do your own research” ideology, is a recipe for societal disaster. In truth, most of us aren’t even well-enough equipped to do our own homework, much less research, on these and other issues. Here’s what that’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/50723306313_d6cce1e745_b.jpg?w=1024" alt="A dental professional examines an older man's teeth in a dental clinic.

No large-scale, double blind research trials have been conducted on flossing, as putting people into a “do not floss” group would be an unethical experiment to perform on their oral health.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of “doing your own research” can only exist side-by-side with a concept that most of us normally take for granted so thoroughly that we rarely, if ever, even mention it: the concept that we inhabit a reality that obeys rules and that those rules can be, at least in principle, understood. This is the core idea behind any field that claims to be scientific in any sense:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that we have a real, physical, material-based (e.g., made of atoms) system,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;that there are underlying rules that govern the behavior of that system,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;that we can observe, measure, control the conditions of, and experiment on those systems,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;gathering results about what happens to those systems in a repeatable, replicable fashion,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;and then that we can draw conclusions about how that system will perform under the real-world conditions we’re likely to encounter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this may not look like the scientific method that you recognize (or that you may have been taught in school), this method of thinking about the world encapsulates how science works. You have a real, material-based system that exists in our physical reality: that can be planet Earth, our drinking water, the population of human children on Earth, or just your one, individual body. You know that this system obeys physical rules (geological, physical, biological, or in the case of less-well-known rules, medical, psychological, or sociological), even if you don’t fully know what those rules are. We can perform experiments on those systems, whether intentionally and in a controlled fashion, or whether observationally based on what happens in a fashion that cannot be controlled by us, such as in astronomical situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg?w=1009" alt="A vivid image of the Eta Carinae nebula reveals a mysterious and bizarre display of bright blue, red, and pink clouds of gas and dust surrounding a central star, set against a dark space background." class="wp-image-529368" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg 1009w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg?resize=20,20 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg?resize=40,40 40w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg?resize=80,80 80w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg?resize=375,381 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg?resize=640,650 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/lossless-page1-1009px-Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.jpg?resize=768,779 768w"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption__desc"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption__desc-inner"&gt;This image shows the Homunculus Nebula surrounding the massive blue supergiant Eta Carinae.

More distant ejecta indicate a much earlier eruption, while the central star has brightened in recent decades to once again become visible to the naked eye. We cannot control events like this; we can only observe them in astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cosmic_Fireworks_in_Ultraviolet_Eta_Carinae_Nebula.tif?page=1"&gt;Credit&lt;/a&gt;: NASA, ESA, N.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the nature of the data that we gather, we can use the full suite of it — complete with all necessary caveats, errors, uncertainties, and limitations — to model the best picture of not only physical reality, but of the relevant issue(s) in question, that best explain the data that we’ve collected. If you want to make a new contribution to a field that’s being studied in this fashion, what you had better make sure you’ve done, well in advance of attempting to conduct new research, is that you’ve understood all of the relevant research that’s previously been conducted in this field, and that you’re aware of the results, issues, models, limitations, and uncertainties that surround that earlier research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is what’s meant by “doing your homework.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you do your homework, and you do it correctly and comprehensively, you lack the most important thing necessary to actually contribute new knowledge to whatever field you’re seeking to wade into: the foundational knowledge — or starting point — needed to even understand what you’re reckoning with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, there are many people who believe that chemicals are bad for you, and that if you can only avoid ingesting or coming into contact with said chemicals, you’d rarely-to-never get ill. This is a small portion of what’s known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature"&gt;the naturalistic (or appeal-to-nature) fallacy&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s a tremendous lack of homework-doing that one must do to even think up such a thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?w=1683" alt="5g tower" class="wp-image-155582" sizes="auto, (max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg 1683w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?resize=1382,1536 1382w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?resize=375,417 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?resize=640,711 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?resize=768,853 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?resize=1024,1138 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?resize=1280,1422 1280w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/50902760827_799a4a4d74_k-e1745359763947.jpg?resize=1536,1707 1536w"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption__desc"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption__desc-inner"&gt;Despite a variety of conspiratorial claims to the contrary, 5G cell towers, which this previous 4G tower in Orem, Utah, was being upgraded to at the time this 2021 photo was taken, pose no danger to human or animal health. In particular, they do not cause cancer, mind control, or spread COVID-19. A few years ago, this (now-obvious) conspiracy theory was taken seriously by millions of advocates across the planet, and no doubt the next upgrade, to the 6G standard, will bring about the same fundamentally anti-science claims.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people use the word “chemical,” they are implicitly talking about a subclass of chemistry: the science of atoms, molecules, ions, salts, enzymes, etc., and how they interact within either a nonliving (for inorganic chemistry) or a living (for organic chemistry and/or biochemistry) system. It should only take you a fraction of a second to realize that every physical system that we interact with here on Earth is made of those very ingredients: atoms, molecules, ions, salts, enzymes, and so on. Humans, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the medicines we take, the living and non-living things we interact with, and so on, are all made up of these raw ingredients, bound together in an infinite combination of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, whether something is natural or not has no relation to its safety or its effectiveness. How common a practice is or was, similarly, bears little relation to its safety or its effectiveness. And yet when many of us hear the word “chemical” we recoil, as we often associate it with a poison or a toxin, even though the truth is that any physical system made up of atoms, which again, is literally everything, can be classified as a chemical. Chemicals are just as likely to keep us safe (for example, chlorinating or brominating a swimming pool) as they are to poison us (for example, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chemical-emergencies/chemical-fact-sheets/cyanide.html"&gt;ingesting cyanide&lt;/a&gt;); it solely depends on what the chemical is used for, where, and in what concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?w=3600" alt="A bowl of golden rice grains, a nutrient-enhanced GMO, set next to bowl of white rice grains." class="wp-image-370733" sizes="auto, (max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg 3600w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=20,12 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=40,23 40w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=80,45 80w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=160,90 160w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=256,144 256w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=320,180 320w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=480,270 480w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=640,360 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=832,468 832w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=1440,810 1440w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=1824,1026 1824w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=420,236 420w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=495,278 495w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=854,480 854w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=375,211 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=1024,576 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Golden_Rice-e1677709451765.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption__desc"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption__desc-inner"&gt;Grains of the genetically engineered Golden Rice (right), compared to the Vitamin A-deficient white rice (left). Hundreds of thousands of children per year, worldwide, on primarily rice diets, go blind from lack of Vitamin A, with even greater numbers dying from it outright. Golden Rice could cure that problem. Scientists, but also many other professionals in public health, marketing, politics, and more are needed to transform this scientific solution into a practical solution, as misinformed advocates frequently and vociferously oppose this life-saving measure.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that idea sounds controversial to you, take heart; it was controversial when it was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison"&gt;first put forth by the scientist Paracelsus back in 1538&lt;/a&gt;, and remains one of the foundational pillars of the science of toxicology. His written statement,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All things are poison, and nothing is without poison; the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison,”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;is often shortened simply to “the dose makes the poison.” If you went out right now and drank two-to-three gallons (~7-11 liters) of water, you’d very likely die from poisoning yourself, while if you drank just a pint (about half a liter), you’d likely feel refreshed. Similarly, if you took 500 milligrams of N-acetyl-para-aminophenol (known commonly as acetaminophen, paracetamol, or Tylenol), you might feel a slight reduction in any fever you had, as well as the aches-and-pains in your body and/or your head, while if you took ten times that dose, it would be life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people raise alarms about toxic chemicals, they often do so without even this basic, foundational knowledge of what toxicity even is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-524855558.jpg?w=1024" alt="A boy is filling a glass with water in a kitchen sink." class="wp-image-474594" sizes="auto, (max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-524855558.jpg 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-524855558.jpg?resize=20,12 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-524855558.jpg?resize=640,419 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-524855558.jpg?resize=768,503 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-524855558.jpg?resize=375,245 375w"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption__desc"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption__desc-inner"&gt;A recent, but dubious, study links exposure to fluoridated tap water during pregnancy to lower IQ scores in infants. Several outside experts expressed concern over that study’s methodology and questioned its findings. Fluoride has been added to community water supplies in industrial countries to prevent tooth decay since the 1950s. Very high levels of the mineral have been found to be toxic to the brain, though the concentrations seen in fluoridated tap water are generally deemed safe, and by a wide margin.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situations very similar to this have come up many times here in 2025: as the institutions that safeguard public health, public safety, and basic protections for children and the environment have all abandoned or otherwise abdicated their duties to society. Fluoridated drinking water, one of the most important public health interventions of the 20th century that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;strengthens bones,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;strengthens tooth enamel,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;reduces cavities in children and tooth loss in adults,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;especially among the lowest socioeconomic groups,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;and that has no quantifiable ill effects at the CDC-recommended levels of 0.7 mg/L (usually measured to be in the range of 0.5-1.0 mg/L) of water,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;has recently been not only called into question as safe and effective for no good scientific reason, but has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fluoride-ban-states-cavities-kids-florida-utah-rcna209750"&gt;already been banned in multiple states&lt;/a&gt; in a wholly political move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, vaccines — rated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm"&gt;the #1 public health intervention of the 20th century&lt;/a&gt; by the CDC — are safe, effective, and reduce or eliminate both the virulence and transmissibility of preventable diseases. Tens of thousands of deaths and millions of infections have been eliminated, annually, by the near-universal adoption of routine childhood and adult vaccinations as recommended by the CDC. Yet many people, out of a combination of fear and ignorance and a woefully misguided view of what vaccines actually do inside one’s body, seek to opt out of these routine vaccinations, putting children, newborns, the immunocompromised, and the elderly at elevated, unnecessary risks of severe illness, long-term injury, and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/pexels-photo-6285385.jpg?w=5760" alt="A healthcare worker in gloves and a mask administers a vaccine injection into a seated man's upper arm.

Uncovering the actual facts, and making them widely available through trusted professionals like doctors and pharmacists, can help.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8007898/"&gt;a 1994 study&lt;/a&gt; concluded that, over the course of the 20th century, the average lifespan of someone born and living in the United States lengthened by more than 30 years, and that approximately 25 years of those gains were due to advances in public health. In addition to vaccination and water fluoridation, those advances also included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;improvements in motor vehicle safety, including the use of seat belts, child safety seats, motorcycle helmets, decreased drinking and driving, and improved engineering designs in vehicles as well as the designs of highways,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;workplace safety, particularly in the reduction of injuries and deaths in mining, manufacturing, construction, and transportation,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;better control of infectious diseases from clean, safe drinking water and improved sanitation practices,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;decline in deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke, which is due to the recognitions of the harms of tobacco, as well as a medical focus on identifying and controlling high blood pressure,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;decline in maternal and infant mortality primarily due to improved hygiene, better nutrition, better access to health care, and access to family planning and contraceptive services,&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;and safer, healthier foods as a result of the reduction in microbial contamination and improved nutritional content of food, with food-fortification all but eliminating nutritional deficiency diseases such as rickets, goiter, and pellagra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of these programs and services, here in 2025 in the USA, have already been gutted, reduced, or revoked entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/mm7341a3-F1-large.gif?w=1185" alt="Bar chart showing percent of vaccination exemptions by US jurisdiction; Idaho has the highest, West Virginia the lowest.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who are the people who are questioning the safety and efficacy of these interventions? Who are the people questioning whether the Earth is warming and whether human activity, and our burning of fossil fuels, are the cause? Who are the people questioning whether SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was the result of a zoonotic spillover and instead are promoting the notion that the virus originated in a Chinese laboratory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In almost all instances, they’re not the bona fide experts in these fields. They’re non-experts, and in most cases, people who haven’t even sufficiently done their homework to learn about the foundations of their fields. If they are in the field, they’re contrarians who do not accept the basic foundational knowledge that is widely accepted for very good, scientific reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On scientific grounds, we know what’s true and what isn’t to a degree of confidence that would shock most people. We know that &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/gain-of-function-research-covid-19/"&gt;SARS-CoV-2 wasn’t created in a Chinese lab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/covid-19-origin-chinese-lab/"&gt;a series of concerted misinformation campaigns&lt;/a&gt; cannot change that fact. We know &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/7-anti-science-myths/"&gt;how anti-science myths take hold in society&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t make those myths any less harmful or any more true. And &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/vaccines-do-your-own-research/"&gt;we know how safe and effective vaccines are&lt;/a&gt;, even if today’s US government sows doubt about it. Reality doesn’t change due to the existence of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/animated_temp.gif?w=1200" alt="Graph showing global average temperature anomaly from 1850 to 2024.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/global-warming-21st-century/"&gt;the very basic science of global warming&lt;/a&gt; — which should be a completely non-controversial issue on scientific grounds — might prove to be what historians will point to as the “wedge” for rejecting the notion that doing one’s homework is important in US society. Back in 1977, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/"&gt;Exxon recognized the reality of global warming&lt;/a&gt;: just 10 years after the &lt;a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/the-first-climate-model-turns-50-and-predicted-global-warming-almost-perfectly/"&gt;scientific community accurately predicted what should occur based on a now-foundational climate model&lt;/a&gt;. That report was buried. During the 1980s, global warming became mainstream climate science, but industry and political opponents painted those raising the alarm about it as, well, alarmists, and claimed that the science was still uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the world came together to ban chemicals that were destroying the ozone layer, inaction on global warming led to an ever-increasing set of global greenhouse gas emissions: a trend that has continued ever since. As biologist Sean B. Carroll noted, there’s &lt;a href="https://today.umd.edu/oped-breakdown-denialist-playbook-6454c7f4-fe63-42c5-8fba-45d9677a1147"&gt;a six-step denialist playbook&lt;/a&gt; that seems to work to sway public opinion every time:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doubt the Science.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Question Scientists’ Motives and Integrity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Magnify Disagreements Among Scientists and Cite Gadflies as Authorities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Exaggerate Potential Harm.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Appeal to Personal Freedom.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reject Whatever Would Repudiate a Key Philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have seen this at play repeatedly: about fluoridated drinking water, about vaccines, about the origins of COVID-19, and about global warming. Many other examples abound, as you can commonly find Americans denying evolution, the Big Bang, a round Earth, or even the rights to equality for our fellow humans here in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ezgif-1-31fc4cf41ffa.gif?w=780" alt="Earth move" class="wp-image-147286" sizes="auto, (max-width: 767px) 96vw, (max-width: 1280px) 60vw, (max-width: 1536px) 46vw, 710px" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ezgif-1-31fc4cf41ffa.gif 780w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ezgif-1-31fc4cf41ffa.gif?resize=375,343 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ezgif-1-31fc4cf41ffa.gif?resize=640,585 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ezgif-1-31fc4cf41ffa.gif?resize=768,702 768w"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption"&gt;&lt;div class="img-caption__desc"&gt;&lt;p class="img-caption__desc-inner"&gt;This view of the Earth comes to us courtesy of NASA’s MESSENGER spacecraft, which had to perform flybys of Earth and Venus in order to lose enough energy to reach its ultimate destination: Mercury. Several hundred images, taken with the wide-angle camera in MESSENGER’s Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS), were sequenced into a movie documenting the view from MESSENGER as it departed Earth. Earth, an oblate spheroid, rotates roughly once every 24 hours on its axis and moves through space in an elliptical orbit around our Sun.

&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a path back from all of this: a path back to reality. First, we have to recognize the value of not “doing our own research,” but of doing our own homework. If we care deeply about an issue — and not just about justifying whatever position we’ve decided to take up for ourselves — the path is not to delude ourselves into overvaluing our own knowledge, expertise, and capabilities. Most of us, quite frankly, will never devote the needed resources into becoming a bona fide expert on most issues, and that is not a flaw in ourselves. The truth is that there is too much foundational knowledge, knowledge that only a specialist who seeks to actually conduct research in the field will acquire, to acquire all of it for ourselves, individually, about every issue that we care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The path back to reality is instead to value actual expertise, and those who have devoted their lives to the betterment of humanity through discovering scientific truths about reality. This isn’t to say that &lt;a href="https://www.freethink.com/opinion/consensus"&gt;the notion of a scientific consensus should never be challenged&lt;/a&gt;; only that those challenges are only legitimate when they come from experts who’ve already sufficiently and scrupulously done their homework. If we can take this path, and return to reality, then we can once again aspire to having a functional society where we all work together to make policies for the collective long-term good of all. Without it, the thin veneer of civilization is likely doomed to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;

Now we should recommend a baby aspirin." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;An earlier study led by Prof Burn found &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/news-and-blogs/news/new-draft-guidance-says-aspirin-taken-daily-could-reduce-risk-of-bowel-cancer-for-people-with-lynch-syndrome/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;a protective effect in those taking 600mg of aspirin every day for just over two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said the new results showed the lowest dose worked just as well as the larger doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"So what we can now say with statistical confidence is that the people taking a baby aspirin are as protected as the people taking two aspirins - but also much less likely to have side effects," he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Professor of Clinical Genetics at Newcastle University, Sir John Burn, led the research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In some people, aspirin can cause bleeding, so Prof Burn said he wanted health regulators to now recommend the lowest dose be given to Lynch syndrome patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Roughly speaking, if someone with Lynch syndrome has about a 2% a year chance of getting mostly bowel cancers, we think if they take aspirin, that is halved - down to about 1% a year," he explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Burn said the next big challenge was to find those who were unaware they even have Lynch syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;He said "about 150,000 patients in the UK" have the condition, but a small number are only tested when they realise cancer runs in their family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It was only when they get cancer in their 40s and 50s, and remember their auntie had cancer, and their granddad." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;Aspirin can cause bleeding in some people&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;NHS England said with only 5-10% of patients diagnosed, identifying more people with Lynch syndrome was a strategic priority. Once diagnosed, they can then be offered cancer screening and monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Burn said: "We can also put them on to a baby aspirin - and cut their risk."     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings of the study will be presented at the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/research-events-and-conferences/the-cancer-prevention-research-conference" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Cancer Prevention Research Conference&lt;/a&gt;, taking place in London from Wednesday, in partnership with the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 05:03:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBjdnpJeC1DTElmbkpmeHFzTm5TSEQxY1VsTW8zSkhvd1JBQzJjbnF0c0dpazE4b05vMzRFTldZT2JhWUx6S0RJXzJEU01laVNweVBiTkwzM093d9IBX0FVX3lxTFB0N3pWTWpWSFEtU2lrMTNJek4wc0VXZnItLTRhOHRBSVNwOG1VOXNKTFBrdnV0TENXVGxRTzFCb1NROVN2Ui1OanU3OXJRYzYwNEZvaXFmY1c1TWZhQ01v</guid></item><item><title>根据科学家的说法，你如何定位你的手臂可以改变血压读数- Earth.com | How you position your arm can alter blood pressure readings, according to scientists - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQUjhvY3NGUnI4TW1fVmNQZm5XV3ptdXBGNlFVc2ctMDFOZUdCSmpMLXdFYzdLY2xiUXBsdExaWWZlQXdNa1BxZ094Qmh5dFhOd0had3BvWjVaYVRjLVFuQXpDSzVRTGV4dDRtRWxxNlhGcVEtTUZwSDRLUUpqakhFZWpkeE9jRHQ1YkNSbVR2ekdVZUpidmk2dlVBQWFWWFJlRm96WmZZT3N4UFBxbl9UcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure drives heart attacks and strokes, yet the routine test that spots it can be surprisingly fragile. Two inches of arm drift are enough to nudge the reading into the danger zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crossover trial at Johns Hopkins now shows that a patient who lets an arm dangle may appear up to 7 millimeters of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/mercury/basic-information-about-mercury" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; higher than one whose arm rests on the exam‑room desk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That difference can tip a person’s blood pressure reading from “elevated” into dangerous “stage 2” territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/tammy-mc-loughlin-brady/2704889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tammy Brady&lt;/a&gt;, MD, PhD, of the &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/som" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, led the investigation that re‑created three real‑world postures seen in clinics every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-designed"&gt;How the study was designed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mimic real checkup conditions, researchers asked each participant to walk for two minutes before every blood pressure reading. Then they rested for five minutes in a quiet room, seated with back and feet supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each person went through four rounds of triplicate measurements using different arm positions. By repeating the desk-supported reading at the end, the team accounted for natural blood pressure shifts over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-blood-pressure-can-fool-us"&gt;Why blood pressure can fool us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of U.S. adults live with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db511.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, the persistent elevation of arterial pressure that strains the heart and vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians rely on a single snapshot often taken in less than a minute, to decide whether to start lifelong medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 133 Baltimore volunteers aged 18 to 80 and rotated them through desk‑support, lap‑rest, and side‑dangling positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers used automated cuffs to remove observer bias and repeated the desk posture at the end to control for natural fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the desk standard, a lap‑supported arm averaged 3.9 mmHg higher &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/systolic-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;systolic&lt;/a&gt; and 4 mmHg higher &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-look-at-diastolic-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diastolic&lt;/a&gt;. An unsupported arm reached 6.5 mmHg and 4.4 mmHg above the baseline for those same numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-trial-uncovered"&gt;What the trial uncovered&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fast-paced clinics, staff may skip best practices without realizing the consequences. It’s common to see rushed exams where patients hold their own arms or sit on exam tables without support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shortcuts might seem minor in the moment, but repeated over time, they add up. Misreadings can creep into charts, shape diagnoses, and affect treatment plans that last for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are consistently measuring blood pressure with an unsupported arm, and that gives you an overestimated BP of 6.5 mmHg, that’s a potential difference between a systolic BP of 123 and 130,” warned &lt;a href="https://globalhypertensionathopkins.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sherry Liu, M.H.S.&lt;/a&gt;, referencing the clinical jump from “elevated” to “stage 1”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern held in younger and older adults, in people with and without &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/global-childhood-obesity-rate-is-expected-to-soar-by-2050/"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, and in those already diagnosed with high pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-to-properly-take-blood-pressure"&gt;How to properly take blood pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desk‑level support keeps the cuff’s mid‑point at mid‑heart height, equalizing hydrostatic pressure along the arteries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop the arm, and gravity demands a higher force to push blood upward, so the gauge records extra pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2023/11/09/where-and-how-you-sit-matters-when-getting-blood-pressure-taken-at-the-doctors-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; instructs nurses to seat patients in a backed chair, feet flat, legs uncrossed, and arm resting on a firm surface that aligns with the right atrium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even well-trained clinicians don’t always follow textbook guidelines. In busy offices, there’s pressure to move quickly, and details like arm height can get overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some providers might think close is good enough, but the research shows that “almost right” still leads to wrong numbers. Unless someone checks posture intentionally, errors can become routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-home-monitors-need-help"&gt;At‑home monitors need help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Millions measure at home, yet many kitchen tables are too low to mimic clinic desks. A pillow under the elbow or sliding the device onto a higher counter can close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuff size matters as well; sleeves that are too narrow can push readings 5 to 10 mmHg higher, a problem affecting about 12 percent of Black Americans with larger &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.124.23473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;arm circumferences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-poor-technique-leads-to-misdiagnosis"&gt;Poor technique leads to misdiagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even small inaccuracies in readings can have a big impact on a person’s health journey. An overestimated result could lead to an incorrect &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/high-blood-pressure-can-be-detected-in-voice-recordings/"&gt;hypertension diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, prompting unnecessary prescriptions or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, a reading that seems only slightly elevated might prevent someone from getting the treatment they actually need. Proper positioning is not just about data quality – it can change real-life decisions and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady’s team plans to test whether a simple reminder on the device screen: “Rest arm on table” nudges behavior in primary‑care offices. They also want to see whether the error shrinks with wrist cuffs that use built‑in position sensors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑health specialists hope standard positioning can prevent thousands of unnecessary prescriptions each year, reducing side effects and costs without compromising cardiovascular safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2824754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 02:50:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxQUjhvY3NGUnI4TW1fVmNQZm5XV3ptdXBGNlFVc2ctMDFOZUdCSmpMLXdFYzdLY2xiUXBsdExaWWZlQXdNa1BxZ094Qmh5dFhOd0had3BvWjVaYVRjLVFuQXpDSzVRTGV4dDRtRWxxNlhGcVEtTUZwSDRLUUpqakhFZWpkeE9jRHQ1YkNSbVR2ekdVZUpidmk2dlVBQWFWWFJlRm96WmZZT3N4UFBxbl9UcQ</guid></item><item><title>致命的“法老诅咒”真菌可能是战胜癌症的关键-印度时报 | Deadly ‘Pharaoh’s Curse’ Fungus may hold key to beating cancer - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine an ancient curse holding the key to a much-coveted cure!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tutankhamun’s tomb was cracked open in 1922, the world was mesmerized and somewhat terrified. Tales of the “Pharaoh’s Curse” swiftly followed: mysterious illnesses, sudden deaths, and a malevolent ancient hex. But modern science has unearthed a far more compelling explanation: a deadly fungus lurking in those sealed chambers, not dark magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The lurking menace:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi like Aspergillus flavus, which thrive in hermetically sealed, humid environments, were dormant in King Tut’s tomb for centuries. Once the tomb was opened, spores could disperse into the air, triggering respiratory infections, particularly in vulnerable individuals. Indeed, researchers hypothesize that Lord Carnarvon’s pneumonia and death may have been tied to invasive aspergillosis acquired shortly after exposure to these ancient molds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what began as a harrowing cautionary tale has now become a beacon of hope. That very fungal kingdom, once an incidental actor in macabre legends, is now a treasure trove for anticancer compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania has discovered that the same notorious fungus, Aspergillus flavus (the "pharaoh's curse fungus"), may hold the key to fighting cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the new discovery say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its dark history, the recent research, published recently in the journal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-025-01946-9" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Nature Chemical Biology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, reveals that the fungus, Aspergillus flavus, contains a special compound capable of targeting cancer cells – a promising breakthrough in the realm of cancer treatment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team isolated a new group of molecules from this fascinating fungus and, after modifying them, tested their effects on leukaemia cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their surprise, they found some remarkable results. By exploring various strains of Aspergillus flavus, they uncovered that some might contain even more of these powerful compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They managed to purify four different peptides, known as ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs), which they named asperigimycins. These compounds demonstrated impressive potential against leukaemia cells, even without any modifications. It turns out that asperigimycins work by disrupting the way cancer cells divide – an exciting mechanism that could lead to new treatments!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per Sherry Gao, a key researcher and Associate Professor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, "Fungi gave us penicillin, and these results show that there are still many more medicines to discover from nature." Dr. Gao added that these compounds block the formation of microtubules, which are crucial for cell division, thus halting the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From mythological curse to medicinal cure&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey of the Pharaoh’s Curse fungus – from deathly spores haunting tombs to life-saving cancer therapies – is nothing short of extraordinary. What began as superstitious fear has, through the lens of science, come full circle to become a source of healing. The narrative arc – from the “Pharaoh’s Curse” mythos to molecular oncology – highlights humanity’s evolving relationship with the natural world. It reminds us that nature’s mysteries, even the ominous ones, can inspire medical miracles. Fungi that once triggered fear are now seen as a pharmacopeia waiting to be unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As phase II clinical trials for fungal‑derived drugs like NUC‑7738 advance, the science and medical community stand on the brink of novel, eco-friendly cancer therapies. These efforts honor ancient lore while forging a hopeful, evidence-based future. After all, who knew a fungus with such a fierce reputation could also be a beacon of hope in the fight against cancer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer immunotherapy may also treat certain autoimmune diseases, claims study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jun 2025 01:26:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>健康专家表示，热浪与周末芝加哥阿片类药物过量服用增加有关-芝加哥太阳时报 | Heat wave linked to rise in opioid overdoses in Chicago over the weekend, health experts say - Chicago Sun-Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxPSTJWUGQ2eTZwQ0thNGhyc29XQnlWRWdIMHN0NVM1Y1dCbUVOTnh4NGNaWFlUbjNhQXBsaGk3T1lVcmMwcVB2el9rMGlfZFd3QW5TSVp0NHdfakZoZjB3aHJUZUt0cExZZ2VTWDRWY0YyUnZGdEpBemlsVE9sUVRWbWlablY4azNmN3VUZWNva25RSFZoOFkzTW5NV2xYWnpJZzdkeDJrNWl6QlhlSWFFdHEwRGY3V0RuY2U2dkFrcjlwUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody RichTextBody"&gt;
                                    
                                        
                                    &lt;p&gt;Chicago’s three-day heat wave might have fueled a surge in opioid overdoses over the weekend, health experts say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty opioid overdoses were reported Friday and Saturday — including more than 37 Saturday alone — triggering the city’s spike alert system, the Chicago Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When surges occur, public health officials and community partners canvass affected neighborhoods to pass out naloxone, a medication used to rapidly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose. They also provide information on opioid use and connect people to treatment if they want it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather officials issued an &lt;a class="Link" href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/weather/2025/06/21/experts-urge-caution-as-heat-wave-arrives-in-chicago-area" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;extreme heat warning&lt;/a&gt; that began Saturday morning and was in effect through Monday night. Saturday’s high reached 95 degrees with a heat index recorded at 106, the National Weather Service said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heat wave may have also played a role in the spike in overdoses, according to Jenny Hua, medical director of behavioral health and interim deputy commissioner at CDPH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always see a seasonal increase in the number of overdoses in Chicago, as well as many other places in this country and around the world,” Hua said. “So certainly heat has a pretty close correlation in terms of the amount of overdose activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s surge marked the first time this year the spike alert system was activated. Overall, health officials note that the number of opioid overdoses has been declining in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s average of 22 overdoses per day is a significant decrease from previous years, Hua said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decrease in overdoses has also led public health officials to lower the spike alert threshold. Last year, the system was triggered when more than 50 overdoses were recorded over a 24-hour period. This year the threshold is at 37 overdoses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most overdoses happen outdoors, there tends to be an increase in usage during the summer months, Hua said. To help prevent spikes, public health officials collect drug samples during outbreaks to improve clinical guidance and quickly deploy resources to the communities experiencing the surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public health is always about prevention, right? So the thing that we’re really trying to prevent is death from overdoses. And we’ve seen fatalities decreased significantly over the course of the last couple of years.” Hua said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of overdoses happen on the city’s West Side, Hua said. Thirty-four percent of EMS calls for overdoses were in five Chicago neighborhoods, including East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, North Lawndale, Austin and Humboldt Park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most overdoses are caused by synthetic opioids — particularly fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we do community-based drug checking, we look at what the drug was sold as, and then what it actually contains,” Hua said. “Drugs can be sold as heroin, fentanyl or dope, but you can expect that they would all contain some combination of synthetic opioids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, the city hit an all-time high, with more than 1,400 overdose deaths. There were 1,322 deaths in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Making even small tweaks to the proteins that make up the shell stopped the virus from replicating as quickly, which suggested that drugs that affect the protein shell could prove to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was these insights that caught the attention of Gilead Sciences, prompting the company to search for drugs that target HIV's protein shell — otherwise known as a capsid — tapping Sundquist as a consultant and eventually leading to the development of lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug itself binds the viral protein shell of HIV, preventing it from assembling properly and productively entering the nucleus of host cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more potent than any drug available, but more importantly, it's very long-lasting. So what the Phase 3 clinical trials show is that it completely protects people from transmission for six months," Sundquist said. "There are still 1.3 million new infections worldwide, and this could really change that trajectory. Of course, the rollout has to be funded and be successful, but right now there's no reason to think this won't have a major impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other HIV drugs, lenacapavir is noteworthy due to its potential for preventing HIV entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, about 40 million people live with HIV and the virus is responsible for 600,000 deaths annually, according to data from the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gileads-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-demonstrated-100-efficacy-and-superiority-to-daily-truvada-for-hiv-prevention" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;large clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in South Africa and Uganda — two HIV hot spots — not one of the more than 2,000 women who received a dose of lenacapavir contracted HIV over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lenacapavir almost completely prevents the transmission of HIV into at-risk populations," Sundquist said. "This is just an amazing result."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approving the drug is just another notch in Sundquist's belt, as he was also &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/2025-warren-alpert-prize-honors-scientists-whose-discoveries-culminated-novel-hiv-treatment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;awarded&lt;/a&gt; the 2025 Warren Alpert Prize from Harvard University last week. In April, Sundquist was named as one of &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51296173" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Time magazine's&lt;/a&gt; 100 most influential people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view ourselves as sort of the feedstock for new ways of approaching medicine," Sundquist said. "We're driven by curiosity to discover things that we don't understand. And I think that's not so different from other kinds of adventurers. The same thing that drives people to discover or climb mountains, I think, drives us to discover how a molecular machine works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the recent success, Sundquist remains driven, saying the work on HIV is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still need a vaccine. That would be even better because then you could give everyone the vaccine and protect everyone, not just at-risk individuals," Sundquist said. "That's been a very difficult problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Rare success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers spent time ensuring that the enzymes they had were modifying the methylation as expected and that development started as usual. Their general finding is that the enzymes did change the methylation state for about 500 bases on either side of the targeted site and did so pretty consistently. But there are seven different imprinting sites that need to be modified, each of which controls multiple nearby genes. So, while the modifications were consistent, they weren't always thorough enough to result in the expected changes to all of the nearby genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This limited efficiency showed up in the rate of survival. Starting with over 250 reprogrammed embryos that carried DNA from two males, they ended up with 16 pregnancies, but only four that died at birth, and three live ones; based on other experiments, most of the rest died during the second half of embryonic development. Of the three live ones, one was nearly 40 percent larger than the typical pup, suggesting problems regulating growth—it died the day after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three live births were male, although the numbers are small enough that it's impossible to tell if that's significant or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest several potential reasons for the low efficiency. One is simply that, while the probability of properly reprogramming at least one of the sites is high, reprogramming all seven is considerably more challenging. There's also the risk of off-target effects, where the modification takes place in locations with similar sequences to the ones targeted. They also concede that there could be other key imprinted regions that we simply haven't identified yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would need to sort that out if we want to use this approach as a tool, which might be potentially useful as a way to breed mice that carry mutations that affect female viability or fertility. But this work has already been useful even in its inefficient state, because it serves as a pretty definitive validation of our ideas about the function of imprinting in embryonic development, as well as the critical role methylation plays in this process. If we weren't largely right about both of those, the efficiency of this approach wouldn't be low—it would be zero.&lt;/p&gt;
