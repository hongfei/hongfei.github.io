We know that some patients report being ignored or even told that their illness is ‘all in their head’. With no definitive tests, many patients have gone undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We wanted to see if we could develop a blood test to diagnose the condition – and we did. Our discovery offers the potential for a simple, accurate blood test to help confirm a diagnosis, which could lead to earlier support and more effective management.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Scientists at UEA and Oxford Biodynamics (OBD) looked at how DNA was folded in patients diagnosed with the condition, which could provide tell-tale signs of ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;They examined blood samples from 47 patients with severe ME/CFS and 61 healthy adults. The team discovered a unique pattern that appears consistently in people with ME/CFS that is not seen in healthy people, enabling them to develop the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Writing in the Journal of Translational Medicine, they said the test had a sensitivity – or the likelihood of a test being positive if that patient has the condition – of 92%. It had a specificity – the probability the test will rule out negative cases – of 98%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Pshezhetskiy added: “This is a significant step forward, for the first time, we have a simple blood test that can reliably identify ME/CFS – potentially transforming how we diagnose and manage this complex disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Alexandre Akoulitchev, the chief scientific officer at OBD, which funded and co-authored the research, said: “Chronic fatigue syndrome is not a genetic disease you’re born with, that’s why using EpiSwitch ‘epigenetic’ markers – which can change during a person’s life, unlike fixed genetic code – was key to reaching this high level of accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, other experts called for more studies to confirm the finding, and for the test to be assessed among a wider population of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Charles Shepherd, medical adviser for the ME Association, said: “These results, using epigenetic profiling, appear to be an important step forward in the search for a diagnostic blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“However, as the researchers point out, a diagnostic blood test has to be both highly sensitive and specific to that condition. In this case, we therefore need to know whether the abnormality is consistently present in the very early stages of ME/CFS as well as in people with longstanding disease who have mild or moderate ME/CFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We also need to know that, in addition to the abnormality not being present in healthy controls, it is also not present in a range of other chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that cause ME/CFS-like symptoms and form part of the differential diagnosis of ME/CFS.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Chris Ponting, chair of medical bioinformatics at the University of Edinburgh, said some of the claims made by the research team were “premature”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said: “This test needs to be fully validated in better-designed and independent studies before it is considered for clinical application. Even if validated, the test will be expensive, likely (about) £1,000.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxPM3FwS1p0ZXk2dkp4dmJXMXNzX3Bha0s5dE90TGNRb3ZXZk8zZ3NwT1l5RjlXU0RoSmlSOUdweUdWN0xJa2tVbTNxQ3FkV2phblgzQTk1TWIxNFRPeVhSOWJwRnh6T0E0N2FsUno4VWxwV29ZOVFKMXNTUnlKZXhYb0ZYRG5qVWxaS1JhOE5VcE1iVkhaMXdxQXdPN2I4RjBiMVhCcFc0Mzh0eFhDMkc0QXgzLTNaTmt6TFQ3UDJWYThhcjROTXNyXw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家列举了可能导致致命的主动脉瘤的常见习惯： “这是喷气燃料……它会让你生病” --《每日邮报》</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-15168561/common-habits-cause-aortic-aneurism.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A leading cardiologist has warned that some everyday habits could be silently putting people at risk of developing a deadly aortic aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Evan Levine, a board-certified cardiologist from Scarsdale, New York, has shared a viral Instagram post revealing ten common behaviours he sees regularly contributing to aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An aortic aneurysm is a dangerous ballooning of the body's main artery. If it bursts, it can cause massive internal bleeding and sudden death, often without warning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From gym routines to popular medications, many of the risky activities are things most people might not think twice about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These are all things I see over and over again in my patients,' Dr Levine told his 92,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some risk factors are genetic, Dr Levine stressed that many are self-inflicted. And for him, there's one clear offender that tops the list, and that's taking cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[It's] just jet fuel. It's a drug to drive the aorta larger [and] it sickens you - don't ever do it,' he said in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNmirLdNu8C/https://www.instagram.com/p/DNmirLdNu8C/"&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even occasional use can cause dangerous spikes in blood pressure that put immense strain on artery walls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading US cardiologist, Dr Evan Levine, has warned that some everyday habits could be silently putting people at risk of developing a deadly aortic aneurysm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But cocaine isn't the only vice wreaking havoc on arteries, with Dr Levine describing smoking as 'cocaine light', as it drives up blood pressure, damages arteries and causes cholesterol build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And for those who have switched to e-cigarettes and vapes, his message is still a firm no as they're all as bad as each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even seemingly 'healthy' behaviours can become risky under the wrong circumstances. Intense heavy lifting, for example, can rapidly spike blood pressure and stress the aorta, particularly in older gym-goers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm not talking about good quality resistance exercises,' he clarifies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But the dude in the corner of the gym who's screaming out his lungs to get the 400lb weight up, it's not good.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medications are another overlooked risk with Dr Levine warning that overusing fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin can weaken the inside of blood vessels and make them more prone to aneurysms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thank you for bringing up fluoroquinolone antibiotics,' one grateful follower commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Most doctors let alone patients don't even know how dangerous they are and that they should only be used as a last resort.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An aortic aneurysm is a deadly swelling of the main artery, often fatal if it bursts. While genetics play a role, Dr Levine says many risks are self-inflicted - with cocaine the worst culprit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He's also increasingly concerned about the long-term use of stimulant medications like Adderall and Ritalin, often prescribed for ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm seeing people in their 40s with unexplained enlarged aortas and the first thing I do is check what meds they're on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Too often those drugs can increase your blood pressure and increase the risk of aneurysm. Only take them if you need to, and not for decades.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In recent years, many people have wound up in cardiology clinics after following  medical misinformation spread online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine is alarmed by the number of patients abruptly quitting statins or blood pressure medication because of what they've seen on TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Statins reduce the amount of cholesterol produced by the liver and increase the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;He even warns that ‘healthy’ habits like heavy lifting can be risky, as they may spike blood pressure and strain the aorta, especially for older gym-goers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He warned that quitting stations will 'increase your cholesterol, inflammation and increase your risk of aneurysms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, he warned against avoiding blood pressure tablets because of outdated ideas that it's 'normal' for pressure to rise with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That was thought about 60 years ago, [and] it's wrong.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Levine also warns about lifestyle habits that gradually erode cardiovascular health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Heavy drinking raises blood pressure and triglycerides and increases the risk of aneurysms, especially in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A junk food-heavy diet, loaded with salt and calories, contributes to obesity and hypertension, compounding the danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And surprisingly, even not eating enough fibre can play a role too, with resultant constipation and straining during bowel movements increasing aneurysm risk and even triggering ruptures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The seriousness of the condition hit home for one follower, who shared her health scare at just 21 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was completely perfectly healthy with zero health conditions and I had an abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture. It can happen to anyone at any time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thank God coffee was not on the list because I'd be doomed if it was,' another joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neurologist and neuroscientist even chimed in with a stark reminder of cocaine's dangers beyond the heart:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cocaine also destroys irreversibly the nerve endings of the nerve synapses. Absolute permanent destruction,' they urged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ultimately, Dr Levine stressed that illness due to aneurysms is often preventable if people take their cardiovascular health seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 01:04:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQc3RkdmJqdzZRODlZanhjZVp4QmQxQ3A2RU1KY2ZVWmY5VzhFSGQ0bGYxWWNLaXlxWFRFWWFtS0s3enk2Um5QelFobnV4bElZa1hQaUh2cnZuSkhLZDVCR2VXdFFtVi11ZGJOQW1TX3AyRDI1STFDQy1qaG5fZTJqa01xbmw1Y1hBeUQ4V2ZZR09RdWpYNVV30gGcAUFVX3lxTE5IRlBBZmRpSEZXR3VfVU1RcDNUY1FNQVZ3NlNZNTUxMDBERzhsUmdWamV1VkJFUTRLZkg0ZHQ3V2d4eU5HRDFWVENhN0hyRTRNNkw2V0tPLTNvNV9DeGNmOURVb2E5Ny1SbDhHd1djYk1XZUJBYXd6QXNmLWlSQ21pVWdIaktja1BLWjQ5UENSakwyMnJnd3JNTEVvaQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，常见的脱发治疗与可怕的自杀副作用有关-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15170661/hair-loss-treatment-effects-suicide.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A common hair loss drug that promises to halt a receding hairline has been linked to suicide, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride, sold under the brand name Propecia and available by prescription, has surged in popularity in recent years after doctors said it could slow male hair loss with little more than a pill a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But as more men turn to the drug, reports of troubling side effects have mounted, with some claiming it left them battling mood swings, loss of libido and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14644175/genitals-mutilated-common-drug-warning-others.html"&gt;even genital shrinkage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, a review of existing literature has concluded that those taking the medication may be at higher risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/israel/index.html" id="mol-7ca2dbd0-a3a3-11f0-8edc-1f4cf24de56c"&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; researchers analyzed eight studies, published between 2017 and 2023, and found a significantly higher risk of suicidal behavior among those taking the drug compared to those who were not taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s unclear why finasteride may raise suicide risk, but researchers say it may lower levels of brain chemicals that calm the nervous system and ease stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mayer Brezis, an internist at the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center who led the study, said: 'The evidence is no longer anecdotal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We now see consistent patterns across diverse populations. and the consequences may have been tragic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The mother of Henry Goyzueta, 50, said her son (pictured) developed penis shrinkage and lost his libido after being prescribed finasteride. His mother also said the drug, which she blamed for his mental health struggles, led to his suicide, though no formal connection has ever been made&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride was approved to treat male hair loss in 1997 and is now prescribed to an estimated 7.5million people every year, almost all men. (The drug is not approved for women, but may be prescribed off-label for female hair loss).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has been taken by celebrities including Elon Musk, and is even rumored to have been used by President Donald Trump to combat his hair loss, though this has never been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FDA first added depression as a possible side effect of taking finasteride in 2011, and updated the label in 2022 to add suicidal behaviors, though researchers had raised concerns over a potential link as early as 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Data from the monitoring system FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), shows nearly 300 suicides among people who took the drug between 1993 and 2025, along with 111 suicide attempts and six suspected suicides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The FAERS system is not verified, and claims can be submitted by anyone. It also only highlights correlations, which do not necessarily prove that any drug directly caused a side effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest scientific review, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/jcp/analytical-review-depression-suicidality-finasteride/"&gt;Journal of Clinical Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; last month, the researchers warned the drug may have caused 'hundreds of thousands' of cases of depression and hundreds of suicides since it was approved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The paper reviewed four studies that analyzed suicide reports among finasteride users from multiple adverse events reporting systems, such as the FDA's FAERS, and four studies that analyzed healthcare records to determine whether finasteride raised the risk of suffering from depression or other mental problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It included a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28319231/"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; by Canadian researchers that analyzed data on 93,000 men who started taking finasteride between 2003 to 2013. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That research warned those on the drug had an 88 percent higher risk of being diagnosed with depression within the first 18 months of starting on the drug. It did not find a higher risk of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mark Millich, pictured above on the right, has said previously that he suffered from mental health problems and saw changes in his genitals after taking finasteride&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review also analyzed a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39138902/"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; involving more than 50,000 men with hair loss, including 23,300 who were prescribed finasteride. Results showed patients who took the drug were 40 percent more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety or depression than those who did not use the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The paper concludes: 'Current evidence shows that finasteride use can cause depression and suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The lesson is that before approving a medication for the market, regulators should require manufacturers to commit to performing and disclosing ongoing post-approval analytical studies, and this requirement needs to be enforced.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The review, however, disclosed that it had significant limitations, including the chance the large databases researchers used could potentially contain errors and poor data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A poor dataset contains errors, gaps or inconsistencies, for example, incorrect birth dates or missing fields. It may also be one where users changed how they recorded information over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also noted that the suggestion in their paper that finasteride could have caused hundreds of suicides was 'highly speculative' and said that more research was needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finasteride works by blocking an enzyme that converts testosterone into another hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is linked to hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medical information from the FDA estimates that more than one in 100 people who take the drug experience problems getting an erection, a lower libido and problems with ejaculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Finasteride does carry a warning suggesting that it could be linked to suicide on its label&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one in 1,000 people, the drug has been linked to swelling and tenderness in the chest and low mood, or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In an update in 2022, the FDA added a warning to the drug's label over a potential link to suicides, with the label now including under the section side effects: 'Nervous system/Psychiatric: Depression, suicidal ideation and behavior'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its manufacturer, Merck, told Reuters in 2021 that the scientific evidence 'does not support' a 'causal link' between finasteride and suicides or suicidal thoughts, adding that these terms 'should not be included in the labeling'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It continued: 'Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia [finasteride].'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Daily Mail contacted Merck ahead of the publication of this article for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 49,000 Americans die by suicide every year, which is the second leading cause of death among adults aged 10 to 34 years old. About 80 percent of suicides recorded every year are in men, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 00:37:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQTTIyZUlLQ2pGdUh4UVI1aXFhMGdNN0R0LTlvVF9uNlFOSUlBTWtreFpQOVJSRUh4cE9nQVI4aUJnbWs4SzFTbUgxTkVsNGhpWEV0N2NWUk9UQmRjbnJxY3FfZ2d2eVY0MHp4NlhsbVNHcHNZSjZyRDgwdU5Na1hsU2FCQ3paNGI4d1hRbGhOS21ZbTdoRkxr0gGcAUFVX3lxTFBHV3hpMUNqTHFGUV9tWFNvU0Z2aGVPdk82TUxERl8wOWRQVU5hcGdvRWhONHRaWEJxWVowWE9XRUF5QkN1MklYTENVYzBDUTNIcEZvakpJelA2TklDMzdEbWtxY0NpYi1VTUpjbExpVEFaMXBFNE9ab0RsU3ZwZHJ6NVJQQXA1X3h4Mzg1X0dCTEdTVHBaZDRwb0FvaQ</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心代理主任表示要打破MMR射击- The Hill</title><link>https://thehill.com/newsletters/health-care/5544062-acting-cdc-director-says-to-break-up-mmr-shot/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;There is no research to support &lt;strong&gt;such a massive change&lt;/strong&gt;, but O’Neill endorsed similar remarks made by President Trump. It’s not clear if the message, made in a Monday post on X, should be seen by drugmakers as an official directive from the agency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;O’Neill &lt;strong&gt;gave no reason why&lt;/strong&gt; he thinks separating the shots and spreading them out over time would be beneficial, but his comments build on the administration’s public skepticism of vaccines. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;The combination MMR vaccine was licensed in &lt;strong&gt;1971&lt;/strong&gt;, and monovalent shots were &lt;strong&gt;phased out in 2009&lt;/strong&gt; due to the success of the combination shot.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Scientists say it &lt;strong&gt;wouldn’t make any sense&lt;/strong&gt; to change that, as there’s no safety issue. Separating the shots would likely decrease adherence to the entire schedule, experts say, and therefore increase disease. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“I think that that would not be met with any enthusiasm by, or acceptance by, either providers or parents who would see their children inoculated with substantially more doses of vaccine,” said William Schaffner, an epidemiologist and professor of public policy at Vanderbilt University.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;It would also be a &lt;strong&gt;massive hurdle&lt;/strong&gt; for the two companies, Merck and GSK, that make combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccines for the U.S. market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span&gt;“These monovalent vaccines are not even available and I do not envision that vaccine manufacturers are going to want to produce these monovalent vaccines – particularly if they need to be studied in placebo-controlled trials as the Department of HHS has called for,” said William Moss, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University’s Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The idea to separate the shots originates from a paper published in 1998 by &lt;strong&gt;discredited British researcher Andrew Wakefield&lt;/strong&gt;, who claimed that the MMR vaccine was linked to increasing rates of autism.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxsmft001r3b6nowj2h8ap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tramadol, a potent synthetic opioid, has been widely used to treat moderate to severe pain, but a new study suggests that the medication’s potential risks outweigh its “limited” benefits for chronic pain and that the use of it should be minimized.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000a3b6ne2w5jnc8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, found that tramadol may have a “slight effect” on reducing chronic pain, but there appears to be low evidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000b3b6nt8rfxrdu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The findings indicate that the benefits of tramadol are questionable or, at the very least, uncertain. Furthermore, evidence suggests the presence of potentially harmful effects,” Dr. Janus Jakobsen, lead author of the study and a clinical professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Copenhagen, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000c3b6nli96vkxg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Tramadol can have serious side effects, including cardiac events such as chest pain, heart disease or congestive heart failure, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000d3b6nj2edj7gg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Therefore, alternative treatment options should be considered before prescribing tramadol,” Jakobsen said. “Patients are advised to consult their physicians to determine the most appropriate treatment for their condition. Such treatments should likely be individualized according to the type of chronic pain experienced.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000e3b6na43ng9m7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, opioids as a class of drugs can be addictive. It’s estimated that about &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/opioid-overdose" target="_blank"&gt;60 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; experience the addictive effects of opioids, and tramadol is often considered safer than other opioids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggyqn2700003b6qheeai0si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to manufacturer records, the new study says, nearly 12 million daily doses of tramadol were consumed worldwide from 1990 to 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000g3b6n4dg2aiuh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study, conducted by a research team in Denmark, included an analysis of 19 separate clinical trials that evaluated tramadol versus a placebo in treating various types of chronic pain. The trials were published between 1998 and 2024, and collectively they involved more than 6,500 people ages 47 to 69. Some of the trials included in the study were related to osteoarthritis, diabetic nerve pain and chronic low back pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000h3b6nv52ipzpp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review related to the usage of tramadol for any type of chronic pain with a thorough investigation of adverse events,” the researchers wrote in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000i3b6njre1vvtw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their analysis found that tramadol increased the risk of both non-serious and serious adverse events, including nausea, dizziness, constipation, drowsiness, cardiac problems and “neoplasm” events, which are an abnormal and excessive growth of cells and tissue that can form tumors. These neoplasm growths can be either benign or cancerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000l3b6npqni0uft@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers also found that there was “low-certainty evidence” that tramadol may reduce the intensity of chronic pain below a certain level that they called the “minimal important difference” threshold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000m3b6nmyhh35wv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Typically, pain intensity is measured using a visual or numerical scale, such as when patients are asked to rate their pain on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 being unbearable pain, Jakobsen said. But since each person may have a difference in pain perception, the researchers used a minimal threshold to evaluate a clinical difference in tramadol’s ability to reduce pain versus a placebo, based on the clinical trials they evaluated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000n3b6n4wf4yubd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Although statistical analyses may reveal differences in pain scores between patients, these differences may be so small that they are not perceptible to the patients themselves,” Jakobsen said. “Therefore, it is crucial to predefine a minimal clinically important difference when assessing pain levels to ensure that the results reflect changes that are meaningful to patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000o3b6nrpawxl13@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the new study, the researchers chose a “minimal important difference” that was equivalent to one point on the 10-point numerical rating scale. It appeared that the beneficial effect of tramadol on chronic pain was below that “minimal important difference” of one point, on average.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgh00smb00063b6qk4ma6gov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Association for Accessible Medicines, which represents manufacturers of generic drugs, didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000p3b6nzlv0k4lv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The takeaway finding that tramadol in randomized placebo-controlled trials did not meet their designated threshold of reducing pain scores by one – I am not too surprised by that,” said Dr. Michael Hooten, an anesthesiologist and pain specialist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000q3b6n56dkgo4e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Opioids for longer-term, persistent chronic pain are not the best medications because of tolerance and other factors that may interfere with the long-term trajectory of opioid therapy,” Hooten said. “As a clinically working pain specialist, this review basically confirms many of the clinical factors that I already intuitively know.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000s3b6ns15b89gl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And although the study found that tramadol may have a “slight effect” on reducing chronic pain levels, that comes with the increased risk of concerning cardiac events and other potential side effects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000t3b6nptr1pipu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “From my perspective, I don’t use a lot of tramadol, because I know there’s going to be a lot of adverse effects. I know the pain-reducing effects are going to be minimal. So that’s not necessarily a drug that I go to,” Hooten said. “That represents my personal, anecdotal clinical practice – if you talk to another pain expert or pain specialist, they’re going to have maybe a completely different opinion. It’s really complex.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000u3b6nl3efu7ob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new study could be overestimating tramadol’s benefits, Jakobsen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000v3b6npwptyuyu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All included trials, except for two, were assessed as having a high risk of bias. This increases the likelihood that our findings may overestimate the beneficial effects and underestimate the harmful effects of tramadol, potentially presenting an overly favorable view of its efficacy,” Jakobsen said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000w3b6nxbg1jicl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tramadol remains widely prescribed for the management of chronic pain and is often regarded as safer than other opioids, but without evidence to support this,” he said. “The use of tramadol and other opioids should be minimized as much as possible. Our study provides evidence in support of this recommendation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000y3b6nczj1nix8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One limitation of the new study is that the amount of time patients were followed varied across the trials, which it makes unclear what the drug’s long-term risks versus benefits may be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v000z3b6nidqctuu6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most of the included trials were short-term – majority 12 weeks or less – so we can’t draw firm conclusions about long-term safety or sustained benefit,” Dr. Jason Chang, assistant professor and interventional spine and musculoskeletal medicine expert at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00103b6nkm6abuf4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The review also grouped together a wide range of pain conditions, which may obscure differences in how tramadol works for specific diagnoses,” said Chang, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “Finally, the study only compared tramadol to placebo – not to other active treatments – so we don’t know how it stacks up against alternatives like NSAIDs or neuropathic medications.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00113b6nsgfycthd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NSAIDs are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and aspirin. Some physicians may prescribe tramadol to people who may not be able to take NSAIDs, for instance due to an underlying health condition or other medications they are taking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00123b6nb730siqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Tramadol is not a magic bullet – on average, it provides only modest pain relief, and it carries real risks, including nausea, dizziness, constipation, and, in rare cases, more serious complications like cardiac events or seizures,” Chang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00133b6nwjwxn98r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It can be useful for select patients who can’t take NSAIDs or need short-term help to restore function, but it should be prescribed with clear functional goals, for limited durations, and with close monitoring for side effects,” he said. “The conversation shouldn’t be about banning tramadol, but about using it smarter – short courses, careful patient selection, and always as part of a plan that prioritizes mobility, function, and quality of life.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00153b6njjki8ndy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new research findings were no surprise to Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Let-Your-Doctor-Kill/dp/B0FPMDZCF6/ref=sr_1_1?c" target="_blank"&gt;Don’t Let Your Doctor Kill You&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00163b6nmabxbeff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This study confirms what I’ve observed in clinical practice for years - tramadol has been marketed as this ‘safer opioid’ alternative, but the reality is far more complicated,” Schwartz, who was not involved in the research, said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00183b6nrudoutuw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If someone is prescribed tramadol, Schwartz said, they should ask their provider these questions: Why are they getting this drug? What alternatives exist? Has anyone actually investigated what’s causing their chronic pain in the first place?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgh0ns8i00003b6n5ruqhp0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that 1 in 5 adults live with chronic pain in the United States, said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, author of the book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Doesnt-Have-Hurt-Smart-Pain-Free/dp/1668014475" target="_blank"&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life&lt;/a&gt;.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgh0q7b600043b6nuhg8ztow@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “About a third of them are restricted in what they can do and how to live. But there are alternatives to medication. We can reduce and even possibly eliminate pain by using our own body’s and mind’s capacity to manage it,” Gupta said. “Options can include meditation and yoga, massage and acupuncture. Even emphasizing eating anti-inflammatory foods like whole grains and leafy greens can help mitigate how our bodies react.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggztxt7000e3b6nsch6ix13@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nonopioid &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/hcp/clinical-care/nonopioid-therapies-for-pain-management.html" target="_blank"&gt;therapies for pain management&lt;/a&gt; may also include ice or heat, elevation, rest and quality sleep, or physical therapy and exercise. Medications may include NSAIDs, acetaminophen or other non-opioid drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmggxmc6v00193b6ncgpioe8c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I do not prescribe tramadol for chronic pain. Period. The risks are clear from this study,” Schwartz said. “The real tragedy is that millions of patients have been prescribed tramadol when what they needed was someone to investigate the actual cause of their pain. We’ve traded real solutions for prescription pads, and patients are suffering for it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

In younger and middle-aged adults, the most common short workout was stair climbing, either at home or on a gym machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among older adults, gentle leg exercises and tai chi—the Chinese martial art that combines flowing movements with controlled breathing—were most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the British Medical Journal, the researchers said: 'Their easy integration into daily routines addresses common barriers, such as lack of time and low motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In addition to research efforts, public health policies should aim to integrate exercise snacks into daily life by encouraging movement breaks throughout the day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-module-version="1.16.0" data-dataset-id="2057" data-mol-fe-xpmodule-newsletter-sign-up data-newsletter="configurable" data-form-action-url="https://link.news.dailymail.co.uk/s/Health" data-environment="production" data-newsletter-id="Health" data-newsletter-channel-colour="health" data-watermark="uk" data-image="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2025/09/25/SignUpModule_Image_Health.png" data-title="Sign up for our free Health newsletter" data-subtitle="Transform your health every Tuesday with expert guides, real-life stories and advice from top doctors"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Exercising for as little as five minutes, twice a day, can boost your cardiovascular fitness, new research has suggested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These quick and easy exercises were found to improve cardiovascular fitness (CRF) by between 4.6 and 17 per cent across the studies reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, researchers saw no significant improvements in muscular endurance, strength or cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 70 per cent of participants were women, and those who showed the biggest gains in CRF were aged between 19 and 44.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors noted several limitations, including small sample sizes, and said more research was needed to confirm the results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also cautioned that the findings may not be fully representative, as the studies did not include equal numbers of male and female participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research, conducted in Australia, Canada, China and the UK, involved exercise programmes lasting between four and 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes amid a worrying rise in heart-related deaths in the UK, which have soared by 18 per cent—from 18,693 to 21,975—between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the British Heart Foundation, there has also been a 21 per cent increase in people being diagnosed with heart failure since 2020—the highest on record.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The number of people with atrial fibrillation—an irregular heartbeat—has also reached a record high, rising from 1.48 million to 1.62 million over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The British Heart Foundation analysis revealed an 83 per cent surge in the number of patients waiting for planned heart treatment in England, from the start of the decade to March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Waiting lists have also grown in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity warned that the shift marks a reversal of decades of progress, during which annual deaths from heart attacks and strokes had halved since the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest the rise may be fuelled by unhealthy diets and increased consumption of processed foods, the effects of Covid on the heart and circulatory system, and ongoing disruption to GP and hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just last year, a separate study found that simple, everyday movements such as carrying shopping bags or climbing stairs in short bursts could halve the risk of heart attack in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said turning these 'incidental exercises' into a regular habit could be a 'promising option' for women who dislike or struggle with structured workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Middle-aged women who averaged just 3.4 minutes of such activity a day were 45 per cent less likely to suffer a major cardiovascular event. They were 51 per cent less likely to have a heart attack and 67 per cent less likely to develop heart failure than those who did none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;In 2024, scientists stumbled upon a potential new treatment for hereditary-patterned baldness, the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/a_to_z/hereditary-patterned-baldness-a-to-z"&gt;most common cause of hair loss&lt;/a&gt; in both men and women worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began with &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8583821/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on a naturally occurring sugar that helps form DNA: the '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt;' part of deoxyribonucleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While studying how these sugars aid &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222111437"&gt;wound healing in mice&lt;/a&gt; when applied topically, scientists at the University of Sheffield and COMSATS University in Pakistan noticed that the fur around treated lesions grew back faster than in untreated mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intrigued, the team decided to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in June 2024, they took male mice with testosterone-driven hair loss and removed the fur from their backs. Each day, researchers smeared a small dose of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deoxyribose"&gt;deoxyribose&lt;/a&gt; sugar gel on the exposed skin, and within weeks, the fur in this region showed 'robust' regrowth, sprouting long, thick individual hairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deoxyribose gel was so effective, the team found it worked just as well as minoxidil, a topical treatment for hair loss commonly known by the brand name Rogaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our research suggests that the answer to treating hair loss might be as simple as using a naturally occurring deoxyribose sugar to boost the blood supply to the hair follicles to encourage hair growth," &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/cure-male-pattern-baldness-given-boost-sugar-discovery"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; tissue engineer Sheila MacNeil from the University of Sheffield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness, or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenic alopecia&lt;/a&gt;, is a natural condition caused by genetics, hormone levels, and aging, and it presents differently in males and females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_155531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg" alt="male pattern baldness" class="wp-image-155531 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/male_baldness_642-600x388.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-155531" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hereditary-patterned baldness presents differently in men and women.

It's not yet approved for female patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-of-studies-link-suicide-risk-with-common-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;Decades of Studies Link Suicide Risk With Common Hair Loss Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finasteride can slow hair loss in about &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/hair-loss/treatment/male-pattern-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;80 to 90 percent of male patients&lt;/a&gt;, but it needs to be taken continuously once it is started. The drug can be associated with unwanted, sometimes severe &lt;a href="https://www.nps.org.au/assets/medicines/c8584165-82ab-4a0f-8b3c-a53300ff8b32-reduced.pdf"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt;, such as erectile dysfunction, testicular or breast pain, reduced libido, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="176602" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The treatment of androgenetic alopecia remains challenging," MacNeil and her colleagues, led by biomaterial researcher Muhammad Anjum from COMSATS, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2024.1370833/full"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the team designed a biodegradable, non-toxic gel made from deoxyribose, and applied the treatment to mouse models of male-pattern baldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minoxidil was also tested on balding mouse models, and some of the animals received a dose of both sugar gel &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; minoxidil for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to mice that received a gel without any medicine, those that received a gel with deoxyribose sugar began to sprout new hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both minoxidil and the sugar gel promoted 80 to 90 percent hair regrowth in mice with male pattern baldness. Combining the treatments, however, did not make much more of a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photographs were taken at various stages throughout the 20-day trial, and the effect is clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_133589" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-133589" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-642x330.jpg" alt="Deoxyribose Gel" class="size-medium wp-image-133589" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-642x330.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-807x415.jpg 807w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-768x395.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002-600x309.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/07/fphar-15-1370833-g002.jpg 1030w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-133589" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photographs of mice with male pattern baldness at different time intervals, including mice without any treatment (NC), mouse models of male pattern baldness (T-1), gel without medicine (T-2), gel with deoxyribose sugars (T-3), minoxidil (T-4), deoxyribose sugar and minoxidil gel (T-5).

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers undertook a review of several PET-CT scans of patients who were taking the drugs, after uncovering the anomaly with one patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A PET-CT scan combines a CT scan and a PET scan. It uses a mildly radioactive liquid, known medically as a radioactive tracer, to show areas of your body where cells are more active than normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A higher level of metabolic activity — and concentration of tracer on the scan — could signal potentially cancerous activity which appears as brighter spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 'several' patterns of tracer on the scans among GLP-1 users that were 'atypical' and 'could be misinterpreted' as hot spots, or potentially cancerous areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hot spot areas, with high levels of tracer, do not always signal cancer and could be a sign of other conditions such as infections or inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Strouhal said: 'Recognising the characteristic uptake associated with GLP-1 agonists helps avoid unnecessary anxiety and interventions, ensuring patients receive the right care, at the right time, without detours or doubt.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, further research involving more data is vital to prove this is the case, researchers said, before recommendations are made to alter PET-CT scan guidelines for all weight loss jab users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Instead, medical teams should carefully consider a patient's medical history when interpreting scan results, they added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research will be presented in full on October 8 at the Annual &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/us-congress/index.html" id="mol-f5ee4ff0-a381-11f0-99dc-5b4f876d999d" class=""&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine in Barcelona. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14182453/Warning-experts-discover-weight-loss-jabs-like-Ozempic-render-breast-cancer-chemo-ineffective.html"&gt;research late last year found&lt;/a&gt; GLP-1 drugs could potentially interfere with breast &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-a73cfeb0-a37c-11f0-99dc-5b4f876d999d" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US study, hundreds of women with early-stage triple negative breast cancer were followed throughout and after treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few dozen (25) were already taking GLP-1s alongside other &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-f5f97280-a38c-11f0-99dc-5b4f876d999d"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; drugs and continued to do so while having cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tests two years later showed just 28 per cent of the women on GLP-1s responded fully to the cancer therapies, and were clear of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than twice as many — 63 per cent — of those not on GLP-1s were cancer free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also discovered&lt;span&gt; GLP-1s had infiltrated tumour cells and &lt;/span&gt;immune cells in samples taken from the patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bethania Santos, an oncologist and researcher at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who presented the study at San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, said: 'Use of GLP-1 use may need to be carefully considered during breast cancer therapy.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts at the time suggested the weight loss drugs themselves may not have decreased the effectiveness of chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Rather, people who have advanced diabetes requiring multiple medications are at increased risk for breast cancer recurrence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, they said, did not prove whether weight loss drugs help or hurt the effectiveness of cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;A Raleigh man is accused
of spraying blood in the eyes of health care workers. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Kameron Gilchrist, 25,
faces two charges for assaulting emergency personnel. He's accused of
exposing two employees to HIV. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It is unclear whether the two
employees contracted HIV through the incident on March 21, 2025. Authorities
arrested Gilchrist on Sept. 11.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;UNC Health Rex wouldn’t comment
on specific patient or employee incidents. The hospital said violence against
medical personnel is becoming more common.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;According to the arrest
warrant, Gilchrist was receiving a diabetic treatment when he allegedly sprayed
blood in the eyes of two hospital employees. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It’s
unclear whether the blood sprayed was Gilchrist’s
or not.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;However, the arrest warrant
says the two hospital employees were caused physical injuries including
irritation and exposure to HIV.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;UNC REX
told WRAL News that protecting the health and safety of its employees is a top
priority. The hospital said it would work closely with its own security teams
and law enforcement to keep everyone safe and pursue charges when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL News asked Raleigh police
why it took six months to arrest and charge Gilchrist.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Raleigh police said Gilchrist
was receiving medical and psychiatric treatment at the time of the incident so
he could not be arrested then.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Authorities are holding
Gilchrist on $25,000 bond. His next court date is scheduled for Dec. 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Ars Technica in August, Brigid Groves, vice president of professional affairs for the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) signaled that efforts to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines is concerning to APhA, which is the leading organization representing pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned about that because the data and evidence point to the fact that this vaccine is safe and effective for [young, otherwise healthy] patients," Groves said. "So, to suddenly arbitrarily limit that is very concerning to us."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, with the CDC's permissive recommendations, pharmacies are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; limiting them. Representatives for both CVS and Walgreens &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/06/cdc-covid-vaccine-rules-eligibility-availability/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzU5NzIzMjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMTA1NTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NTk3MjMyMDAsImp0aSI6ImZlZjBlODg3LTU5ZjMtNDk3YS1iNjczLWVkYzllYzRlMDg0MiIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9oZWFsdGgvMjAyNS8xMC8wNi9jZGMtY292aWQtdmFjY2luZS1ydWxlcy1lbGlnaWJpbGl0eS1hdmFpbGFiaWxpdHkvIn0.1KVy4WMWh2DE7lNseEMo-5J4KtGZtRkqt9P_6HtMQUs"&gt;told The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that they would not require patients under 65 to prove they have an underlying condition to get a COVID-19 vaccine. CVS won't ask you to self-attest to having a condition, and Walgreens also said that it won't require any proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In simplest terms, if a patient wants to get the vaccine, they’ll get it," Amy Thibault, a CVS spokesperson, told the Post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the shared decision-making, there may be extra forms about risks and benefits that might take an extra few minutes, but it should otherwise be just like past years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, this reporter was able to easily book same-day appointments for an updated COVID-19 vaccine at local CVS and Walgreens pharmacies in North Carolina, without attesting to any medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Children&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shots for younger children could be trickier&lt;/strong&gt;: While adults and older children can visit their pharmacy and get vaccinated relatively easily, younger children (particularly those under age 5) may have a harder time. Pharmacists typically do not vaccinate those younger children—which has always been the case—and parents will have to visit the pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians, like pharmacists, are likely to be supportive of broad access to the shots. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said that &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/COVID-19/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;all children should have access&lt;/a&gt;. The AAP also specifically encourages children under age 2 and children with underlying conditions to get vaccinated, because those children are at higher risk of severe disease.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the United States alone, over 50 million people deal with the complications of osteoporosis. While it's more common in people over 50, you can show symptoms earlier, especially since the human body reaches peak bone mass by age 30. The disease causes bones to weaken or become brittle, leading to serious injuries even from minor complications. Putting any amount of strain on the bones and body structure, like coughing, falling, or bending over, can cause a severe bone break in those with the disease. We know a lot about it — it's caused by the growth of new bone not keeping up with the loss of old bone, and can be characterized as a deficiency — though getting enough calcium and vitamin D when younger can help prevent it. Treatment is a little more tricky, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02291-y" target="_blank"&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/a&gt; could prove it's possible to reverse the disease and create a real treatment. Spearheaded by researchers from University of Leipzig in Germany and Shandong University in China, the scientists identified a natural bone-strengthening mechanism in the human body that can be targeted for said treatment. The gene, GPR133 or ADGRD1, influences bone density in the body and adjusts the bone-building process through cells called osteoblasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, currently available osteoporosis treatments slow the condition but do not halt or reverse the process. Moreover, they come with a lot of baggage — risky side effects like an increased risk of infection or disease. As the body builds a tolerance, they also become less effective over time. In fact, some risky NSAIDs &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/lifestyle/walmart-issues-supplement-recall-due-to-hidden-drugs-check-your-pantry-now/" target="_blank"&gt;have been recalled by retailers like Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, at the moment, preventing osteoporosis is the best we can do; doing so is even &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/1971165/what-us-military-body-fat-rule-high-fitness-scores-explained/" target="_blank"&gt;a reason the U.S. military's body fat rule has changed&lt;/a&gt;. Focusing on fitness over a low body fat percentage can help prevent future issues, weakened bones being one.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;span class="gallery-image-credit"&gt;Crevis2/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is not the first time the GPR133 gene has been linked to bone density and development, and in the 2025 study, the researchers began by focusing on the proteins that gene encoded. They used a chemical called AP503 — which was "only recently identified via a computer-assisted screen as a stimulator of GPR133," according to biochemist and &lt;a href="https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/newsdetail/artikel/research-for-stronger-bones-and-muscles-in-old-age-2025-07-03" target="_blank"&gt;University of Leipzig&lt;/a&gt; researcher Ines Liebscher — to test the bone strengthening and weakening process in mice. In short, they used that chemical to activate the gene, or leave it dormant when absent, which directly influenced how the mice grew. When the chemical activated the gene, they grew up with strong, healthy bones. When the chemical was absent, the mice had weak bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The experiments show that the chemical AP503 can act as a sort of button to enable or disable growth, encouraging the osteoblasts in the bone to work harder. Interestingly, the research team was also able to show that when working together with regular exercise in the subject, the two methods can strengthen bones even further. If developed into future treatments, scientists believe they could be used to strengthen bones that are already healthy, and rebuild weakened bones. Most importantly, they should be effective at any age — even women going through menopause changes. In fact, weakening bones and the general deterioration of bones and cartilage is &lt;a href="https://www.bgr.com/science/this-is-why-you-shrink-as-you-get-older/" target="_blank"&gt;a big reason why you shrink as you get older&lt;/a&gt;, so it's important that any treatments would be usable later in life. Overall, this some pretty big news. But, of course, potential treatments are not even close to human clinical trials, so it could be a long while yet before those treatments make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

In healthy individuals, this gene is typically active only in alpha cells, which produce glucagon, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, to raise blood sugar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), the SMOC1 gene is active in beta cells. This is a critical problem because beta cells produce insulin, another hormone that regulates blood sugar levels, to lower blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people with T2D, beta cells are reprogrammed into dysfunctional alpha-like cells, and the SMOC1 gene is the primary driver of this damaging transformation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, introducing the SMOC1 protein to healthy beta cells impaired their ability to produce and release insulin. The inability to make or use insulin effectively is the defining characteristic of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discovering SMOC1 as the key culprit driving the harmful transformation could lead to the development of a drug to block SMOC1's action and halt &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15078069/treatment-reverse-type-2-diabetes-banish-insulin-jabs.html"&gt;the progression of T2D&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Geming Lur, co-corresponding author and researcher at City of Hope, one of the country’s most advanced cancer treatment organizations, said: ‘Normally, SMOC1 is active in healthy people’s alpha cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But we saw it start showing up in the diabetic beta cells, too. It should not have been there.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The study identifies SMOC1 as the key driver of beta cell failure, making it a promising drug target. Blocking it could protect insulin-producing cells and halt T2D progression (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using advanced single-cell RNA sequencing, City of Hope scientists analyzed pancreatic tissue from 26 donors: 13 with T2D, which affects more than 37 million Americans, and 13 without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This approach allowed the researchers not only to identify cell types but also to categorize the cells into precise groups and map the dysfunctional pathways that cause insulin-producing cells to transform and fail in people with T2D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After gathering a massive genetic dataset, the team used sophisticated computational analyses to identify the five alpha cell subtypes, including AB cells, immature cells that can develop into either alpha or beta cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To confirm that the gene SMOC1 was a key driver of beta cell dysfunction, the researchers increased SMOC1 levels in human beta cells in the lab and observed a direct, detrimental effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insulin production dropped and the cells began to lose their identity, transforming into a different, dysfunctional cell type. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further tests revealed that SMOC1 crippled beta cell function by simultaneously halting insulin secretion and disrupting the cell's ability to produce new, functional insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is critical because insulin is the hormone that signals to the body's cells to allow sugar from the blood to enter and be used for energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without enough properly functioning insulin, sugar builds up in the bloodstream, which is the root cause of the high blood sugar levels that define diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers' final round of validation showed that SMOC1 protein levels were significantly higher in diabetic patients and, critically, that this protein was present within the insulin-producing beta cells themselves, confirming its role in the human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Randy Kang, senior research associate at City of Hope and a co-author, said: ‘The SMOC1 gene has barely been studied in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Based on these properties, we suspect SMOC1 strongly influences the differentiation and function of beta cells.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This discovery opens a new front in diabetes treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While current medications like GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as Ozempic, manage blood sugar, a therapy that directly targets and inhibits SMOC1 could be the first to address the root cause of beta cell failure by protecting their identity and function, potentially halting or reversing disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, there are no approved gene therapies targeting the SMOC1 gene for T2D. The discovery of SMOC1's role is very recent, placing it at the earliest stages of therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62670-5#Sec2"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A team of scientists has identified five different sleep profiles that link the quality of a person's shut-eye with a variety of health, psychological, and lifestyle outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it's something we all do frequently, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fragments-of-bacteria-in-our-gut-may-lull-our-brains-to-sleep-at-night"&gt;science of sleep&lt;/a&gt; is still pretty murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new study, the scientists examined multiple aspects of sleep quality and how they related to a variety of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-6-sleep-traits-to-risk-of-172-diseases"&gt;Massive Study Links 6 Sleep Traits to Risk of 172 Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They analyzed information on 770 healthy young adults collected through the Human Connectome Project, which includes brain imaging data as well as patient-reported sleep, health, and lifestyle characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all this together, the team identified five distinct sleep-biopsychosocial profiles that show unique patterns of brain network organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first profile links poor sleep with negative mental health outcomes. Patients fitting this profile showed a range of sleep problems, particularly taking longer to fall asleep at night and being less satisfied with their sleep overall. They expressed higher  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, stress, fear, and anger problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176639" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176639" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-642x267.png" alt="Study Says There Are 5 Types of Sleeper – Here's What Your Profile Says About Your Health" class="wp-image-176639 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-642x267.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-998x415.png 998w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-768x319.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1-600x250.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Sleep-profile-1.png 1046w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176639" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The first sleep profile in the study shows clear links between a range of sleep issues and mental health outcomes. (Perrault et al., &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biol.&lt;/em&gt; 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the second profile presented no major sleep problems, but still had mental health issues, including higher  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-adhd" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73112" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt;, anger, stress, fear, and sadness, and lower conscientiousness. For patients in this group, their issues likely stem from other causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third profile was defined largely by the use of sleep aid medications. People in this group demonstrated greater conscientiousness and reported feeling more satisfied in their friendships and emotional support networks. However, they also showed increased cognitive problems with visual episodic memory, fluid intelligence, and spatial orientation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profile number four was mostly linked to sleep duration, with fewer hours of rest associated with more aggressive behavior and difficulty with emotional processing, language, and fluid intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the fifth profile was driven largely by sleep disturbances, waking frequently during the night. These patients also exhibited aggressive behavior and similar cognitive issues as profile four, but were also more likely to have thought problems, anxiety, high blood pressure, be smokers, and show symptoms of alcohol dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The different sleep profiles were also supported by unique patterns of brain function measured with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="176630" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that sleep experiences are reflected not just in health and behavior, but also in the brain's wiring and activity," &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/what-type-of-sleeper-are-you-and-how-is-it-impacting-health"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Aurore Perrault, neuroscientist at Concordia University in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sleep has been extensively studied, most studies examine single factors in isolation, correlating with single outcomes. The team hopes that by looking at a wider range of associations and understanding which of the five profiles best describes each patient, doctors may better diagnose and treat sleep disorders and related health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, research is constantly revealing new ways that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-stage-of-sleep-seems-to-be-critical-for-reducing-risk-of-dementia"&gt;sleep is linked with our wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-heart-begins-to-suffer-after-just-3-nights-of-bad-sleep"&gt;Too little is unhealthy&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of ways – but so is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-study-found-too-much-sleep-increases-risk-of-death-heres-why"&gt;too much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-explain-what-a-good-nights-sleep-actually-looks-like"&gt;hours aren't a good measure&lt;/a&gt; alone: some people &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-do-some-people-need-less-sleep-the-answer-lies-in-our-genes"&gt;naturally need more or less&lt;/a&gt; than others. Instead, it's about the quality, and that's affected in various ways by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/do-you-sleep-on-your-back-or-side-heres-the-research-on-optimal-sleep-positions"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/mattresses-could-be-exposing-kids-to-dangerous-chemicals-while-they-sleep"&gt;where&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sharing-a-bed-might-come-with-some-surprising-benefits-survey-finds"&gt;who with&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/huge-accelerometer-study-suggests-the-best-sleep-time-for-heart-health"&gt;when you sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's enough to keep you up at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://plos.io/46mr43w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Discover why they should be avoided and which healthy practices you should turn to instead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e4fb96" class="body-graf"&gt;How we process devastation, grief, loss and sadness isn’t one size fits all. Neither is how we offer comfort. However, of the many modes of support, there’s one that experts say is a big no-no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc7ed9" class="body-graf"&gt;Instead of consoling someone, this common phrase tends to “minimize what that person is experiencing,” licensed clinical psychologist Ayanna Abrams, Ph.D., founder of &lt;a href="https://www.ascensionbehavioralhealth.com/"&gt;Ascension Behavioral Health,&lt;/a&gt; tells TODAY.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11d6de" class="body-graf"&gt;By saying it, you “are dismissing the validity or maybe even the intensity of what is happening,” she adds. This response lacks empathy and fails to make an emotional connection between you and the person you care about during their time of need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-58d8db" class="body-graf"&gt;Though you likely mean no harm, telling someone to "just get over it" is doing the opposite of what you intended, which is why Abrams avoids it at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-518b6d" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Have I Ever: Told Somebody to ‘Just Get Over It’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c8ed34" class="body-graf"&gt;You might tell someone to “just get over it” because you don’t know what else to say, Abrams says. Sometimes, when we don’t know how to show up for someone, we encourage them to make the problem go away. That move, however, is more beneficial to you than it is to the person seeking help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-055061" class="body-graf"&gt;Other times, frustration is the driving force, Abrams says. You might tell someone to “just get over it” because you’re tired of hearing about a particular problem again and again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b98ddc" class="body-graf"&gt;In her practice, Abrams has also found that some people think this is a helpful thing to say. “Like it’s something the person hasn’t thought of,” she says. But trust that the person has likely tried to get over it and can’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-c689c4" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0e4ee" class="body-graf"&gt;By telling someone (or yourself) to “just get over it,” says Abrams, you’re encouraging someone to disconnect from their emotions — which any mental health expert will tell you is never a good thing. Suppressing a feeling almost guarantees it will “demand to be felt,” Abrams says. The more we try to push them aside and compartmentalize, the more they’ll keep making their way to the forefront of our minds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-84c4e6" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37648224/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4141473/#S47" target="_blank"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; that pushing feelings away causes &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/how-deal-stress-daily-basis-t126882"&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/cardiologist-tip-to-reduce-stress-in-10-minutes-rcna224766?search=stress" target="_blank"&gt;coronary artery disease and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, and adverse social outcomes. It can also lead to anxiety and depression, Abrams adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0fcdf8" class="body-graf"&gt;Encouraging someone to get over something can also cause feelings of judgement and shame because they’ll feel like they’re not processing something quickly enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-521d70" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to Do Instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-721ae2" class="body-graf"&gt;If someone tells you to “just get over it,” says Abrams, turn to these coping mechanisms instead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-62fc7a" class="body-heading"&gt;Sit with your emotions.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3c5dd" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is a practice of mindfulness,” says Abrams. “It means allowing whatever comes up to come up, whether that’s physiologically, whether that’s emotionally, whether that’s physically. It’s not fighting the thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4016c1" class="body-graf"&gt;“Oftentimes, unpleasant emotions stay around longer because we try to control them,” Abrams points out. “If you are able to engage in a tolerant act of letting emotions move through you,” they’ll eventually make their way through your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8935b3" class="body-graf"&gt;Once we allow ourselves to sit with our emotions, “we learn how to cope with them differently, and it mitigates how they sit in our bodies,” she adds. Eventually, that emotion will take less and less of a toll on your mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-48af9d" class="body-graf"&gt;If you find yourself itching to tell someone to get over something, do this instead:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="anchor-e78453" class="body-heading"&gt;Practice empathy.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d561ca" class="body-graf"&gt;“Meet the person where they are,” says Abrams.

The warning asks anyone who returns from affected regions and develops a sudden fever, headache, or intense body aches to contact a clinician quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oropouche&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes called sloth fever because the virus circulates in sloths in parts of Latin America. Most people recover within a week, though a small number can develop brain or nerve complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah A. J. Guagliardo, PhD, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;), has led recent work clarifying how quickly symptoms start and what that means for travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-symptoms-of-oropouche-virus"&gt;Symptoms of Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus belongs to the Orthobunyavirus group and is an arbovirus, meaning a virus that is spread to people by biting insects. It was first identified in Trinidad and Tobago in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness usually causes an abrupt fever, pounding headache, and joint and muscle pain. Some patients also report nausea, light sensitivity, and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors sometimes hear about symptom relapse a few days after apparent recovery. That second wave is uncomfortable, but most people still recover fully with rest and fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-we-know-about-the-u-k-cases"&gt;What we know about the U.K. cases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/communicable-disease-threats-report-week-34-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;surveillance&lt;/a&gt; in Europe recorded three travel-linked Oropouche cases in U.K. residents. All three people had visited Brazil in early 2025. The cases were all were imported, with no sign of local spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pattern matches what other European countries saw in 2024 and 2025. Imported infections arrive with travelers, then stop because the key insect that spreads this virus is not established in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mosquitoes-may-spread-oropouche"&gt;Mosquitoes may spread Oropouche&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus spreads mainly through the bites of infected biting midges, tiny insects that thrive in warm, humid areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mosquito species can also transmit it. People who spend time outdoors without repellent or window screens are at higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are studying vertical transmission, which is when a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/giant-dormant-virus-punuivirus-discovered-in-algae-could-revolutionize-gene-editing/"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; passes from a pregnant person to the fetus. That question matters for travel counseling even if the overall risk remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual spread has not been documented, but health agencies note that the virus has been detected in semen and vaginal secretions. That finding warrants caution for recent travelers who develop symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-incubation-of-oropouche-virus"&gt;Incubation of Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fever can rise quickly, often with severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and aching joints. Clinicians also watch for rashes, dizziness, and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In conclusion, our results indicate that 50% of travelers infected with OROV will develop symptoms within 3 to 4 days of exposure,” wrote Dr. Guagliardo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/7/25-0468_article" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of travel-associated cases estimated the incubation period using patient exposure timelines and symptom onset data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relapse of symptoms can occur in a significant share of patients. That possibility helps explain why some people feel better, then feel unwell again several days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pregnancy-and-severe-outcomes"&gt;Pregnancy and severe outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-7-2024-qa-oropouche-fever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; the first Oropouche-related deaths on July 25, 2024, and investigators also examined possible mother to child infections during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those events were rare, but health authorities continue to analyze what factors increase risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When doctors also see neck stiffness, confusion, or persistent severe headache, they consider meningitis or encephalitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are uncommon complications of Oropouche but need urgent care because they involve inflammation around the brain or in the brain itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prevention-that-actually-works"&gt;Prevention that actually works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;U,K. health &lt;a href="https://ukhsa.blog.gov.uk/2025/08/13/what-are-the-symptoms-of-oropouche-virus-disease-and-how-can-you-avoid-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; recommends &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-repellents-that-actually-work-yes-thanks-to-ai-machine-learning/"&gt;repellents&lt;/a&gt; with at least 50 percent DEET for travelers to affected areas, along with long sleeves and trousers during peak biting hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other precautions include staying in rooms with air conditioning or secure window screens, sleeping under fine mesh nets, removing standing water near lodging, and carefully following insecticide instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who recently returned to the U.K. from the Americas and develop sudden fever should call a clinician and mention their travel history. Early testing helps rule out other infections with similar symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prevention-guidelines-for-travelers"&gt;Prevention guidelines for travelers &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;International health agencies emphasize that Oropouche virus joins a longer list of insect-borne infections that &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/hpv-common-virus-drives-skin-cancer-growth-by-hijacking-the-bodys-cells/"&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; travelers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agencies often package advice on Zika, dengue, chikungunya, malaria and Oropouche together, since all rely on insect bites for spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to encourage simple habits, like packing repellents before trips, just as routinely as carrying sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health authorities also point out that individual precautions are only part of the picture. Surveillance, early diagnosis, and coordinated &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mosquito-borne-diseases-are-a-growing-threat-in-a-warming-world/"&gt;mosquito&lt;/a&gt; control in affected countries remain the backbone of prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without these broader efforts, even well-prepared travelers may still face risks when outbreaks surge in tropical areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-more-questions-about-oropouche-virus"&gt;More questions about Oropouche virus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKHSA recently &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/689ca9d49a65499b446361ff/oropouche-virus-a-rapid-evidence-gap-map.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mapped&lt;/a&gt; 269 studies on Oropouche and found strong evidence on surveillance and viral genomics, yet very limited research on vaccines, treatments, and real-world public health measures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no human clinical trials of medicines and few data on which community interventions curb spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those gaps matter for planning.

Participants were more likely to recall words they were told to remember than those carrying emotional weight, even though emotion sometimes strengthened recall or caused false memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, sleep itself did not enhance memory performance, though certain sleep brain waves, such as sleep spindles, were linked to better recall of emotional material. These findings suggest that conscious intention plays a stronger role than emotion or sleep in shaping what the brain stores and forgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intent Beats Emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Directed memory (“remember this”) was more effective than emotional content for recall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep Brain Waves Matter:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep spindles aided recall of emotional cues, but overall sleep had no major effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Memories:&lt;/strong&gt; Negative emotional words increased the likelihood of recalling events that never occurred.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Frontiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A good night’s sleep has long been understood to help us consolidate new memories, but we don’t understand how. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associations with negative feelings like fear or stress can improve recall, but intentionally trying to remember can also be effective. But these two mechanisms are very different — one involuntary, one deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which influences memory most?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, researchers asked participants to remember or forget words, some of which had negative emotional associations. They found that instructions improved recall more than emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we intend to remember and to forget can be powerful,” said Dr Laura Kurdziel of Merrimack College, lead author of the article in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;. “We have more control over our memories than we often think we do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep on it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers performed two matching studies — one where 45 participants completed the task online, and one where 53 participants visited the lab. Half of each group received their words to remember in the morning and then tested their memories that evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other half received their words in the evening and were tested on the following morning, after sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the evening group of lab-based participants, the team supplied electroencephalogram (EEG) headbands that measured their brain activity while they slept. All participants took part in two sessions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the first session, participants watched 100 words appear on a screen, each followed by a cue to remember or forget. Half of the selected words had negative emotional connotations, and the other half were neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately afterwards, participants were shown another set of 100 words and asked if they recognized them. 50 of these were from the previous task, but 50 were ‘foils’ which they hadn’t seen before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the second session, 12 hours later, the scientists asked participants to report as many of the words they’d been asked to remember as possible. The scientists then analyzed the participants’ performance and EEG data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building a memory palace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that when it comes to memory, instructions do indeed work better than emotion. People were more likely to recall words they had been asked to remember. However, emotions did play a part: words participants had been asked to remember that had negative connotations were more likely to be remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that although instructions were the primary influence on recall, emotional cues could amplify the effect of instructions. Emotions also increased the chances of false memories: negative foils were more likely to be misremembered as words participants had been asked to remember. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During encoding, we will devote more attentional resources to words that we are told explicitly to remember,” said Kurdziel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Along similar lines, cognitive control systems can ‘tag’ information as relevant, biasing the hippocampus to prioritize it. This increases the likelihood that the memory will be reactivated during sleep and transferred to long-term storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lastly, instructions don’t just enhance relevant items, they also suppress irrelevant ones. By inhibiting competing memories, remember-cued items face less interference, which improves recall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, whether participants had slept had no effect on how well they recalled words. However, the different types of brain wave activity measured by the EEG were linked to recall. For example, higher levels of REM theta power, a measure of REM sleep, were associated with the misremembering of negative foils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep spindles were associated with better recall of negative, remember-cued words,” said Kurdziel, referring to a kind of brain wave that looks like a burst of spikes on the brain wave recordings. “Sleep spindles are widely implicated in the transfer of information from temporary hippocampal storage to more stable representations in the neocortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By contrast, slow wave sleep was negatively correlated with total recall,” Kurdziel continued.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was somewhat unexpected — slow wave sleep is often associated with improvements in declarative memory. However, it has also been theorized to facilitate active forgetting of irrelevant or redundant information.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could indicate that sleeping only consolidates some memories — prioritizing things you’re motivated to remember over things which are emotional — and that sleeping in general is less significant than your brain’s activity during sleep. However, more research is needed to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The number of participants who provided usable EEG data was relatively small, which reduces confidence in the strength of sleep–memory associations,” explained Kurdziel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, the sample consisted primarily of college students, making it difficult to generalize the findings to broader populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759856954665"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does emotion help or hurt memory recall?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Emotional content can enhance recall slightly but also increases false memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759856970272"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does sleep improve memory in this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: No general memory boost was found, though certain brain waves during sleep correlated with recall accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1759856983658"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What was the strongest factor influencing memory retention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Intentionally deciding what to remember had the greatest impact on long-term recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this memory and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b9c9cbdccacaf9dfcbd6d7cdd0dccbcad0d797d6cbde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://frontiersin.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Frontiers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angharad Brewer Gillham – Frontiers&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2025.1643449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Top-Down Instruction Outweighs Emotional Salience: Nocturnal Sleep Physiology Indicates Selective Memory Consolidation&lt;/a&gt;” by Laura Kurdziel et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top-Down Instruction Outweighs Emotional Salience: Nocturnal Sleep Physiology Indicates Selective Memory Consolidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; Sleep plays a crucial role in memory consolidation, not only stabilizing newly encoded information but also potentially supporting forgetting. Yet it remains unclear how sleep prioritizes what is retained or discarded when multiple salience cues, such as emotional valence and top-down instructional goals, compete for consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; In two studies, we examined how emotional content and intentional memory instruction interact to shape memory performance across a 12 h interval that included either nocturnal sleep or wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a directed forgetting paradigm with neutral and negatively valenced words, followed by immediate recognition and delayed free recall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; In both Study 1 (online) and Study 2 (in-lab), behavioral results showed that instruction to remember significantly enhanced recognition and recall, whereas emotion alone did not produce consistent benefits; however, sleep condition did not impact memory performance. In Study 2 (in-lab), which included overnight EEG monitoring, physiological markers of sleep revealed meaningful correlates of memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, sleep spindle activity predicted recall for negative remember-cued words, while Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) and delta power were negatively correlated with total recall, suggesting a trade-off between deep sleep and memory accessibility. REM theta power was associated with increased false recall of emotionally negative foils, consistent with emotional memory generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; Importantly, these findings extend prior nap-based research by demonstrating that full-night sleep physiology reflects selective consolidation mechanisms even in the absence of overt behavioral effects.

The reports show that the global antibiotic drug-development pipeline is facing a dual crisis: a scarcity of drugs in development and a lack of innovation in methods to fight drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antimicrobial resistance is escalating, but the pipeline of new treatments and diagnostics is insufficient to tackle the spread of drug-resistant bacterial infections,” said Yukiko Nakatani, who is the WHO assistant director-general for health systems in Geneva, Switzerland, in a statement. “Without more investment in research and development (R&amp;amp;D), together with dedicated efforts to ensure that new and existing products reach the people who most need them, drug-resistant infections will continue to spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health research has highlighted the extent of the AMR crisis. A report published in &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; last year found that the annual number of deaths from drug-resistant infections could increase to nearly two million by 2050, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03033-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;up from one million a year between 1990 and 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The total number of deaths attributable to AMR is predicted to rise to 1.91 million in 2050, with a further 8.22 million associated deaths (see ‘Resistance on the rise’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Awareness of this issue is increasing; however, it is still a silent pandemic with many deaths not being attributed to AMR,” says Rietie Venter, a microbiologist at the University of South Australia in Adelaide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543782.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543782.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Resistance on the rise.

According to the analysis from the WHO, 90 antibacterial drugs are currently in development (see ‘Innovation crisis’). However, only 15 qualify as innovative — drugs that exert an additional clinically significant benefit — and only five are effective against at least one of the ‘critical bacteria’ listed on the WHO’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;bacterial priority pathogen list&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2023, the number of antibacterial drugs in clinical-development pipelines has decreased after a WHO ruling stated that some of them were non-innovative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The preclinical pipeline remains active, with 232 programmes across 148 groups worldwide. However, 90% of companies involved are small firms, which highlights the fragility of the R&amp;amp;D ecosystem, the report says. Large pharmaceutical companies have been leaving the antibiotics market for years owing to a lack of financial investment and &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02884-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;low approval ratings of new antibiotics.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543794.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543794.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Innovation crisis.

AMR happens when bacteria and other microorganisms evolve ways to become resistant to drugs after being exposed to them, meaning drug makers have to play a constant cat-and-mouse game of creating new antibiotics to overcome evolving resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs in human medicine and agriculture are the main drivers of AMR, which is why cuts to antibiotic usage are needed to reduce drug-resistant infections, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00961-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00961-z" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;alongside new antibiotic therapies&lt;/a&gt;. Gwen Knight and Kathryn Holt, who are co-directors of the AMR Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, say that there are insufficient data to know the relative importance of livestock versus human antibiotic use in driving AMR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World leaders have committed to cutting the global use of antibiotics to reduce AMR-related deaths by 10% by 2030. However, the pledge doesn’t look likely to succeed, because projections suggest that antibiotic use in both humans and livestock will increase in the years ahead (see ‘Animal antimicrobials’). “We cannot prevent the development of AMR, but we can implement measures to slow it down, and currently, we are not super successful with this,” says Venter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543780.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03218-x/d41586-025-03218-x_51543780.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Animal antimicrobials.

Many of the deadliest infections are caused by a group of bacteria with particularly strong drug resistance, called gram-negative bacteria. This category includes &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt; — a pathogen associated with hospital-acquired infections. Only five of the antibacterials currently in the drug-development pipeline are effective against these priority bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes during menopause can drive suicidal thoughts – a crisis that healthcare services have failed to recognise or adequately address. The devastating link is laid bare in &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17455057251338941"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; my colleagues and I conducted recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, which involved interviews with 42 women who experienced suicidal thoughts and behaviour during perimenopause or menopause, exposes a troubling pattern. Women in crisis are being prescribed antidepressants instead of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), despite clear &lt;a href="https://themenopausecharity.org/information-and-support/what-can-help/treatment-options/hormone-replacement-therapy/antidepressants-and-menopause/"&gt;menopause guidelines&lt;/a&gt; stating that antidepressants should not be a first-choice treatment for menopause-related low mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, suicide rates have climbed among women in their &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/282203/suicide-rate-in-the-united-kingdom-uk-since-2000-by-gender/"&gt;mid-40s to mid-50s&lt;/a&gt; – precisely the age when most experience the menopausal transition. Yet the role of hormonal changes in this mental health crisis has been largely ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women in the study described feelings of profound hopelessness and entrapment. One participant said: “What’s the point in being alive? What purpose, what function do I have? I’ve got nothing left to give, nothing left to contribute. Why am I still here?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perimenopausal depression they described went beyond ordinary low mood, encompassing crushing fatigue, a sense of worthlessness and the feeling of being a burden to loved ones. Many questioned whether their lives had any remaining value or purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A healthcare blind spot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research revealed alarming gaps in medical knowledge and care. Women reported lengthy delays in receiving appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and frequent misdiagnoses. Many said their GPs lacked a basic understanding of how hormones affect mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There was zero knowledge about hormones,” one woman said of her GP. “They were doing their best with what they felt they knew, but they didn’t know anything about this subject whatsoever. It’s not on their assessments to ask about women’s menstrual cycles.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when women explicitly requested hormone treatment, some were refused due to a rigid interpretation of clinical guidelines. &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/383/bmj.p2730"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that antidepressants are being prescribed disproportionately to women – a pattern that, in some cases reported in the study, worsened symptoms rather than relieved them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Women reported delays in receiving hormone replacement therapy.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/stop-smoking-nicotine-substitution-nrt-drug-2335895299"&gt;Andrey Popov/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hormonal upheaval of menopause doesn’t occur in isolation. In midlife, women often juggle caring responsibilities, career pressures and domestic demands. These are pressures that layer on to the biological changes they’re experiencing, creating an intense mix of physical and emotional strain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Women are now widely recognised to be losing jobs, relationships and, in some cases, their capacity to make decisions due to menopausal symptoms. Mood swings, anxiety, brain fog, hot flushes and feelings of profound sadness can be debilitating. Yet, for many, these symptoms are dismissed or misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dismissal has deep historical roots. The outdated diagnosis of female “hysteria” – a misogynistic label used to pathologise women’s emotions – once justified treatments as extreme as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4890704/"&gt;asylum confinement and electroconvulsive therapy&lt;/a&gt;. The word may be gone, but its legacy endures in the way women’s hormonal suffering is still minimised as exaggeration or overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs of change. In 2021, an &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/menopause-and-the-workplace-how-to-enable-fulfilling-working-lives-government-response/menopause-and-the-workplace-how-to-enable-fulfilling-working-lives-government-response"&gt;independent UK government report&lt;/a&gt; made ten recommendations to support menopausal women in the workplace and beyond. And, in November 2024, clinical guidelines were updated to recommend psychological support for women experiencing early menopause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But suicide risk for midlife women has not been adequately highlighted in menopause guidance – a gap that urgently needs addressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many women in the study reported dramatic improvements in mental wellbeing and a reduction in suicidal thoughts after receiving timely HRT and support from healthcare professionals who actually listened. Some described their lives as becoming tolerable again after years of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all women will benefit from hormone replacement, but all deserve to have their hormones checked and to be offered treatment when appropriate. The choice should be theirs – informed, supported and taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The silence around menopausal mental health has lasted too long. It’s time healthcare services recognised this crisis for what it is: a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since the pandemic, it has become common for counties or healthcare systems to enact mask requirements ahead of the winter cold and flu season - what doctors have called the 'quad-demic' - to try and prevent co-occurring outbreaks of the flu, Covid, the common cold and RSV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Face masks became a mainstay during the Covid pandemic, with pro-maskers arguing they helped prevent infections by catching virus-laden droplets expelled when people sneeze, cough or talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11702865/Masks-make-little-no-difference-Covid-infections-massive-cross-country-meta-analysis-finds.html"&gt; major review &lt;/a&gt;by the Cochrane Collaboration, the 'gold standard' for evidence-based investigations, found that coverings made 'little to no difference' to Covid infection or death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some experts have warned that many masks contain holes that are too large to catch droplets, saying people should use medical-grade N95 masks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Others have raised concerns that failing to wash reusable masks regularly can turn them into a breeding ground for bacteria, increasing the risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;California had a strict mask mandate during the Covid pandemic, with face masks required statewide in most public settings from June 2020 until June 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In December 2021 to February 2022, the state reimposed mask mandates for indoor areas again amid a surge in Covid cases and hospitalizations. Multiple counties in California also pursued more stringent masking policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Federally, face masks were required to be worn on federal property and public transport from January 2021 until June 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During his first term, President Donald Trump and California Governor Gavin Newsom clashed over face masks, with Newsom consistently wearing a mask at briefings during 2020 while Trump notably refused to wear one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above are pedestrians wearing face masks in San Francisco in June 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Announcing the new face mask order, the Sonoma County's department of health said that it had first required visitors and staff to wear face masks at its health care facilities in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It said this year's order covered fewer health care facilities than in previous years, and said the order would apply annually unless it is rescinded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Covid cases have dropped slightly since August in California, according to wastewater data, when the state was recording 'very high' levels of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Covid activity in California remains 'high', above the 'moderate' level nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nationwide, wastewater surveillance suggests Covid levels dropped from 'high' to 'moderate' over the week to September 20, the latest available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both flu and RSV levels, however, are 'very low' in the US and California, according to wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it is still early in the respiratory virus season, which the CDC says falls between October to mid-May every year, with viruses peaking between December and February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest complete data for the week to September 6, California had a Covid hospitalization rate of 4.4 per 100,000 people, the same as the previous week, but nearly double the rate of 2.6 nationwide over the same period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The state's Covid death rate was around 0.1 fatalities per 100,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both hospitalization and death rates are well below the peaks they hit during the pandemic, when hundreds of Covid-linked deaths were recorded in the US every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new mandate, however, comes amid growing concerns over a new Covid variant that appears to be causing cases to surge in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The strain XFG, also known as Stratus, has become dominant nationwide and in every region except the South since its first appearance in the US in March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists say it is more infectious than previous strains, although it does not appear to be more likely to cause a severe infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns over the variant are rising as the US heads into respiratory virus season, when cold temperatures lead people to spend more time crowded indoors, where respiratory viruses spread easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 15:18:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPQ1hPQ2dTeEFibE9EcTdYaWpweFRmRGxfaW5Tajd3TkZLVWh3SjZLaTZlYVpzM09MUFlnUDNmZ3Q1TXJIRkNSOEZubDZjVTNZdDNWUXc2ME45QUF4Z3E4Vzdzd0xuOGVOdXFHaHVLTTVkeXVpY3ktZzNiMWQxV1pNUVY1SWRmbE04NjZtVDNOQ28zQ2ZSaHfSAZsBQVVfeXFMTUlvalZ1WWpraVhmb2VSQTFsdTlFWEFNTXJibWhhRVd3QTdqTFFEQm5MeDVLdU54OWhfQ1Q2QnFEYk5pdi1taG5DLWtwRHVXb2lSWldTV2tUT1pIei1DZUVNY2hQNTJ1cVVBSVFOUjAyeGpuNHRtY0lwM2tHTW5tel9yeEdpaVJOaUlsQVFHMjdTWnEydExmb0ZQXzQ</guid></item><item><title>如何快速击败冬季感冒（你可以忘记维生素C ） -《每日电讯报》</title><link>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cold-flu/beat-winter-cold-fast-immunologist/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;However, there are two other vitamins with good evidence for supporting the immune system – &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/vitamin-d/"&gt;vitamins D&lt;/a&gt; and A. A 2020 review in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients &lt;/em&gt;concluded there is an “indisputable relation” between &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/supplements-worth-taking1/"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system, with a deficiency possibly leading to infection or an autoimmune condition. Davis therefore recommends sticking to NHS guidance and taking a vitamin D tablet each day during the winter months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D exists in two main forms – D2 which comes from plants and fortified foods like plant-based cereals, and D3 which is produced in human skin and found in animal-based foods like fish and egg yolks. Evidence suggests that vitamin D3 is generally more effective than D2 at raising and maintaining vitamin levels in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, there is a wealth of evidence which suggests that vitamin A helps the immune system to work properly. Davis says deficiency is rare in the UK (but a significant issue in some parts of the world), as most people here consume enough vitamin A in their diets with cheese, eggs, oily fish, milk and liver products all being good sources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men need 700mcg of vitamin A and women 600mcg a day, according to the NHS. (One large hard-boiled egg contains around 75mcg, 100g of cooked salmon contains roughly 69mcg, whilst a tablespoon of cod liver oil contains a substantial 4,080mcg of vitamin A.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The myth: Eating probiotic yogurts to stay healthy through winter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yogurts with health benefits are all the rage nowadays, but whilst they seem convenient, Davis urges caution against &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/gut-health/yogurt-greek-fermented-good-for-gut-immune-system/"&gt;probiotic yogurts&lt;/a&gt; that neatly package gut health and immunity-boosting benefits into an easily consumable bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These brands may create the impression that the bacteria in your yogurt drink will boost your immune health but, quite simply, this isn’t yet clearly proven,” he says. “Whilst the experiments are clear in that the bacteria in your microbiome certainly do influence your immune system, the gap in our knowledge is exactly how this relationship works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his most recent book – &lt;em&gt;Self Defence: A Myth-busting Guide to Immune Health&lt;/em&gt; (Vintage, 2025) – Davis references &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22052061/"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; where volunteers were fed a particular strain of live bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium infantis 35624&lt;/em&gt; for eight weeks. In that time, the levels of T cells (white blood cells which help your immune system fight germs) in their blood increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This demonstrates that probiotics in the form of live bacteria could feasibly support immunity, however it stops short of proving a medical benefit because we don’t know if an increased number of T cells improved those participants’ protection from infections and viruses, Davis says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we’re scanning the supermarket shelves, he urges us to “beware of the hype” and take a step back to think about who is promoting a product with miraculous health benefits, if they have an agenda, and what the evidence really shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;What actually works: Managing long-term stress&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people rely on magnesium supplements to both increase their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/magnesium-7229399" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; intake and to improve issues like stress, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/headache-overview-7094882" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;headaches&lt;/a&gt;, and sleep issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But while magnesium supplements can be helpful, they don't always work well with everything else in your supplement routine. &lt;strong&gt;Some nutrients compete with magnesium for absorption in the gut,&lt;/strong&gt; which can negatively impact magnesium status. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-calcium"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/calcium-8558241" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Calcium&lt;/a&gt; supplements are commonly taken to improve and maintain bone health, often alongside magnesium.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Although it’s &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/calcium-and-magnesium-8425841" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;safe to take them together&lt;/a&gt;, separating magnesium and calcium supplements may improve the absorption and maximize the benefits of both of these nutrients.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Calcium and magnesium compete for absorption in the gut. &lt;/strong&gt;Excess calcium blocks the absorption of magnesium into the cells lining the gut and increases urinary excretion of magnesium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “When calcium is present in higher concentrations compared to magnesium, the body’s ability to absorb and use magnesium significantly decreases and supplementation is less effective," &lt;a href="https://www.connealymd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Leigh Erin Connealy&lt;/a&gt;,  integrative and functional medicine doctor and Medical Director at Center for New Medicine, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get the most out of your magnesium and calcium supplements, Connealy recommends waiting around two hours between taking magnesium and supplementing with other minerals, like calcium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-iron"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/iron-benefits-7643991" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is a mineral that’s necessary for growth, energy production, hormone synthesis, and neurological development. It’s an essential part of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/low-hemoglobin-7108717" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hemoglobin&lt;/a&gt;, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like calcium, it’s generally safe to take iron and magnesium together. However, &lt;strong&gt;taking either in high doses can decrease the absorption of both minerals, as they compete for absorption in the gut.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;While taking iron and small doses of magnesium usually won’t cause an issue, it’s best to take them separately, separated by a few hours, to promote optimal absorption. &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium salts like &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/magnesium-oxide-8416154" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium oxide&lt;/a&gt; are more likely to reduce iron absorption. They may interfere with iron by raising the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/ph-balance-7101062" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;pH&lt;/a&gt; in the intestines. Since iron availability depends on an acidic environment, this reduces its absorption. Additionally, some forms of magnesium salts can directly bind to iron, further interfering with its absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For the most benefits, it’s recommended to take iron separately from other minerals, like magnesium, ideally on an empty stomach.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-zinc"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Zinc is required for immune function, protein production, skin health, and many other essential processes. &lt;strong&gt;When taken in high doses, zinc and magnesium can compete for absorption.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Zinc and magnesium are like two people trying to get through the same small doorway at the same time,” &lt;a href="https://web.nimbushealthcare.com/jobby-john" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jobby John, PharmD&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO and founder of both Lake Hills Pharmacy and also Nimbus Healthcare, told &lt;em&gt;Health&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “They compete for the same absorption pathways in your small intestine. If you take a very large dose of &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/nutrition/zinc-supplement" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; with magnesium, the zinc can "win" this competition, leading to less magnesium being absorbed," he explained. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Doses of over 50 milligrams per day, which far exceeds the 40 milligram upper limit set for zinc, may interfere with magnesium absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other factors can influence how well your body absorbs and retains magnesium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are other things that can affect magnesium absorption:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medications: &lt;/strong&gt;Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), diuretics, and antibiotics can reduce magnesium absorption or increase the amount of magnesium you lose through urine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health conditions:&lt;/strong&gt; “Conditions that affect the small intestine, such as Crohn's disease, &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/celiac-disease-overview-7488159" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;celiac disease&lt;/a&gt;, or diarrhea, can significantly impair the body's ability to absorb magnesium and other nutrients,” John said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nutrient levels:&lt;/strong&gt; John explained that having adequate &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.health.com/condition/osteoporosis/12-ways-to-get-your-daily-vitamin-d" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; levels is important for optimizing how much magnesium your body can use from food and supplements. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; As you age, a natural decrease in stomach acid in the digestive tract can lead to reduced absorption of minerals, including magnesium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet: &lt;/strong&gt;Excessive alcohol and &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/effects-of-caffeine-8698957" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; consumption can interfere with magnesium absorption and also increases its excretion through the urine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Being aware of how these factors influence your ability to absorb magnesium and maintain healthy levels can help you make smarter choices about your diet and supplement routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While magnesium supplements can help you reach and maintain optimal levels, taking magnesium supplements with mineral products, like calcium, iron, or zinc, may lead to reduced absorption or increased excretion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To reduce this risk, it’s best to take magnesium separately from other minerals and to be aware of other factors, such as medications and medical issues, that could impact magnesium levels.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Because vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin, you remove most of it when you opt for low-fat dairy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill Charton, a celebrity fitness trainer based in Georgia, noted Greek yogurt's probiotic benefits, which support &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/digestive-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;gut health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"Because vitamin K2 is a fat-soluble vitamin, you remove most of it when you opt for low-fat dairy," a personal trainer told Fox News Digital.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, eating other anti-inflammatory foods like fatty fish, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;raw nuts&lt;/a&gt; and seeds, berries, leafy greens and healthy fats, like olive oil, while reducing processed foods, trans fats, refined sugars and avoiding alcohol and smoking can also help reduce inflammation in our body," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;MORE FROM FOX NEWS LIFESTYLE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trainer told Fox News Digital that regular exercise and getting enough sleep are also crucial to reducing inflammatory markers, as well as staying hydrated and avoiding stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Taking high-quality supplements like omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin and &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/vitamins-supplements" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;certain vitamins,&lt;/a&gt; like vitamin D, may help reduce inflammation," Charton added.

The ACIP vote on Covid vaccines was itself delayed from June to mid-September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="7f350e48-d547-4279-971a-3305a571ec40" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"States rally to offset fracturing of federal healthcare agencies: ‘Diseases don’t see state lines’","elementId":"7f350e48-d547-4279-971a-3305a571ec40","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/states-healthcare-vaccines-recommendations"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Jim O’Neill, acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), officially signed off on the recommendation last week, according to an HHS press release – though the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt; on ACIP recommendations has not yet been updated with these details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The CDC also officially removed the recommendation for the combined MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, the statement said. This vaccine is preferred by one in six parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;O’Neill said providers were previously deterred from counseling patients on the benefits and risks of Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Informed consent is back,” O’Neill said in the statement. “CDC’s 2022 blanket recommendation for perpetual COVID-19 boosters deterred health care providers from talking about the risks and benefits of vaccination for the individual patient or parent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were no limitations on such discussions, which are common between patients and providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Unless people mime their vaccine request, there’s always some discussion before a vaccine is given,” said Dorit Reiss, a professor focused on vaccines at UC Law San Francisco .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When patients go to a pharmacy or a doctor’s office for vaccines, they are already undergoing shared decision-making, Reiss said. “Unless the goal is to only have the conversation to deter people, what does this do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is also beyond the ACIP’s purview to require discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Thomas Nguyen, a pediatrician and associate professor of pediatrics at Ohio University Medical School, notes “the problem is they aren’t allowed to do this”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Federal law allows the CDC to update its Vaccine Information Statement (VIS), which providers must offer to every vaccine recipient or their caregiver. But “they have no basis to require a discussion”, he said, and informed consent is already the standard for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Every pediatric Covid vaccine we have given, I have offered to discuss the risks and benefits with the family and every single one has declined,” Nguyen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The families who are getting Covid vaccines already know they want it, he continued. “The people who want to get a Covid vaccine for their kids are the ones who are really committed to it, who have done their research and feel like it’s a good idea for their kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the delays in recommending the vaccines have created obstacles for families who want them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Vaccines for Children (VFC) program covers &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/pdfs/mm7333e1-H.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;52%&lt;/a&gt; of children in the US: anyone under the age of 19 who is under-insured or uninsured, eligible for or enrolled in Medicaid, or Native American or Alaska Native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Vaccines are included in the program only when they’re recommended by the CDC, so children who would normally receive Covid vaccines through VFC have not been able to get them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Every visit this fall has been the same, said Elias Kass, a naturopathic physician in Washington state specializing in pediatric primary care. Families asked about seasonal vaccines, and he told them about the annual flu shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Then they say: ‘And Covid?’” Each time, he answered: “Nope. We don’t have Covid vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Washington is one of &lt;a href="https://www.immunizationmanagers.org/resources/aim-policy-maps/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;12 states and territories&lt;/a&gt;, along with the city of Houston, with a universal VFC program, which means they offer vaccines for free to all children (and, in some places, all adults). In universal states, providers order all vaccines through the VFC program – but they couldn’t order any Covid vaccines at all without the CDC recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We still don’t have doses in hand,” Kass said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The timing was critical, as flu vaccination campaigns have already gotten under way for the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We are missing a really crucial window to vaccinate kids. We have been giving flu vaccines for a couple of weeks,” Kass said. “​​It’s a huge lost opportunity. I don’t know if we’ll get those families to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition to limiting boosters for young children, the delay has “created this huge gap for our infants”, Kass said, “who are at very high risk of complicated Covid”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Covid vaccines have been plagued by persistent access issues and misinformation, resulting in already low vaccination rates among children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Approximately 10,000 six-month-olds become eligible to receive Covid-19 vaccines every day, but parents continue to struggle to find access to that vaccine,” said Michelle Fiscus, a pediatrician and chief medical officer of the Association of Immunization Managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the stakes are high. Children under two, especially infants, are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;high risk&lt;/a&gt; for hospitalization and death, second only to people aged 75 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Children may also suffer from long Covid, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/30/health/long-covid-children.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;repeat infections&lt;/a&gt;, and unknown complications could arise long after infection – as sometimes happens with viruses like measles, human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr, and cytomegalovirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The delay caused “huge” equity issues, Kass said, especially among children who have been marginalized within the health system because of socioeconomic status or racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There were already significant access issues plaguing pediatric vaccines across the country, with some providers declining to stock the vaccines due to a perceived lack of interest and misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The argument that I often hear from pediatricians is that they don’t stock Covid vaccines because there’s low demand,” said Fiscus. “But the reality is that parents do call and ask for the vaccine, but are told that it’s not being stocked. So to an extent, that’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some providers offer outdated reasons for not stocking the vaccines, like previous needs for ultra-cold storage or multi-dose vials, Kass said. “They’re justifying not stocking it with reasons that are no longer relevant, but they’re assuming nobody wants it anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS press release also highlighted “vaccine safety signals” and “unintended side effects during routine immunization”, even though the Covid vaccines are extremely safe and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;That’s “the biggest problem” among Nguyen’s patients, he said. Certain health officials and Republican politicians have been very vocal about the purported risks of Covid vaccines “to the point that almost nobody wants them”, he said. This fall, he has given out 325 flu shots and only 16 Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPaE1GNFFqZ0t6ZlNoOVp6UnJIWHF3eXlaWXE4UUNIbGN3M3c1elFDRUN6NXk4RHRCMjZDRWVKRF9xbldRMFdZRUVZZl9sVXZkZUVXencxamF1aXFUNE43WUFLMXI5Uy03SVpnRkF4X0dTcHRhTnpYajZYRW9zZGZQWG96b1BjMUdhRDdWTVFDRlYwUnB0cGp2S2QtNA</guid></item><item><title>服用太多泰诺已被证明有风险。特朗普没有谈论这些。-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/health/tylenol-acetominophen-liver-damage-kenvue.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:43:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQUFdadVpJVVNzYnUtU091bTRNaWJWLXQ5bUs4cW1vUGVFSUVzZ3puYkJ5REtZOUpiU0c3LTVPUm14Yy1CTU5fRXQteVgzWl9Ua0F3Nnc3M1VVbzVvM3U0ekZyRU94MG00LWI2VnFsd1dmRmdqdmotdG5Cb0xVUlkzc01fOWN0U1pwMDFETDZBRmplUQ</guid></item><item><title>这种生活方式因素与阿尔茨海默氏症有关- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/lifestyle-factor-linked-alzheimers-110000248.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;This Lifestyle Factor Is Now Linked to Alzheimer's&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Philip Friedman for Women's Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new study explores the connection between &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a42679413/causes-of-obesity-genetics-lifestyle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:obesity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a43582040/alzheimers-first-signs-may-appear-in-eyes-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Researchers found different cellular messengers in people with obesity that signal plaque formation in the brain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here's what this means for you, according to doctors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists still don’t know exactly what causes&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a64232091/alzheimers-treatments-womens-brains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer's disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;. But as more and more research funnels in, there are lots of new theories and datapoints trying to draw a clear picture of the devastating disease. Now, there's another factor to consider: New research suggests that obesity could fuel Alzheimer's progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While obesity has been linked to a range of serious health conditions like&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a19994093/heart-disease-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65933499/three-habits-lower-diabetes-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, the Alzheimer’s disease connection is new. It’s important to point out that the researchers didn’t find that having obesity &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; Alzheimer’s disease—they just found a link. But it raises a lot of questions about why the two might be connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what a neurologist and obesity medicine specialist want you to keep in mind when trying to parse this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clifford Segil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70603" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers isolated something called extracellular vesicles from fat cells. These vesicles are cell-to-cell messengers in the body and they can signal the buildup of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a65872748/omega-3-women-alzheimers-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:amyloid-β plaque;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;amyloid-β plaque&lt;/a&gt;—a key feature of Alzheimer’s disease—in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gets very technical, but the researchers basically discovered that the fat composition in these cell messengers is different in people with obesity. The obesity factor was also correlated with how quickly amyloid-β clumped together in lab models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their findings, the researchers suggest that targeting these little cellular messengers and interrupting their plaque-building signals may help lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease in people with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is obesity linked with Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear. The researchers simply found a link between the way certain cells act in people with obesity and the potential formation of plaques in the brain. But so far, there's no evidence that obesity causes Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a novel idea and obesity in the past has not been considered a modifiable risk factor for memory loss,” says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be a few reasons for this link, though. “This study provides a potential explanation that perhaps fat cells are releasing substances that are being transported to the brain, causing a buildup of amyloid plaques that can contribute to Alzheimer’s disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/mir-b-ali" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mir Ali;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mir Ali&lt;/a&gt;, MD, medical director of MemorialCare Surgical Weight Loss Center at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA. But he stresses that more research is needed to learn more about this connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chronic inflammation caused by obesity could impact the brain as well,” Dr. Ali says. “But nobody is 100 percent sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are extracellular vesicles and what role do they play in the body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles are tiny particles that travel throughout the body and act as messengers in cell-to-cell communication. They are capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier which means they can interact directly with receptors in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A certain amount of fat or lipids are necessary for our body to work well,” Dr. Segil explains. “Many chemicals in our bodies are bundled into small packages and produced in one part and then used in another part of the body. These packages that these substances are transported in around the body requires a [fat] outer membrane to being transported and these packages are called ‘vesicles.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can I do to reduce my risk of developing Alzheimer’s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Segil points out that having obesity is an “unclear” risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. However, it is a risk factor for diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that, Dr. Ali recommends doing what you can to maintain a healthy weight by eating a varied diet and exercising regularly. If that doesn’t help, he suggests talking to your healthcare provider about next steps. “There are a lot of option to help,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower your risk of dementia in particular, Dr. Segil recommends doing what you can to eat a healthy diet and get in daily exercise. He also suggests keeping your brain “busy” as much as possible. That means socializing regularly, and pushing yourself to learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 13:12:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxORW5HaVhnTHZJakEtSXlNRTFGX28tTGlWQlhwaldCWEtoN25vTVV3WlJ1aW9ZU2x0bTlIRUtxaG51MEgxcTkteFhSd25zejdiRWJrbEFjbE9qNlRDakQzZHZuMUhNSWM5LUFVVXE3ZGxVQzdEZU5tVzVIdmFNYkNhcHlUbzM</guid></item><item><title>冠状病毒专家建议再次佩戴口罩- Glasgow Live</title><link>https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/wear-face-masks-again-covid-32627965</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss Covid experts are urging the public to start wearing face masks once more, just three years since the Covid-19 pandemic was officially declared over. The recommendation comes amid rising Covid cases across the UK, with health officials anticipating a surge in viral infections throughout the winter months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immunologists in Switzerland have stressed that wearing a face mask remains an effective way to reduce the transmission of viruses such as Covid. While the guidance is primarily aimed at those most at risk of developing severe illness from viral infections, including elderly people or those with weakened immune systems, experts have also indicated that people who aren't considered vulnerable may choose to wear a mask as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the height of the pandemic in the UK, the government introduced compulsory rules on wearing face coverings in specific public areas where the danger of transmitting the virus was greatest. These included shops, supermarkets, public transport, and NHS facilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tanja Stadler, an epidemiologist at ETH Zurich and chairwoman of the Swiss Confederation's Covid scientific task force, told SonntagsZeitung: "In crowded, enclosed spaces, such as public transportation, it's advisable for vulnerable people - those over 65 or those with compromised immune systems. Even those who aren't vulnerable can protect themselves from troublesome infections and, at the same time, show solidarity with others."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tanja stressed, though, that she isn't calling on respective governments to impose another compulsory face mask mandate like the one implemented during the height of the pandemic. Instead, she suggested authorities should establish a 'virus bulletin' to help notify people of potential virus hotspots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She continued: "Data on the spread of viruses already exists, but it's not easily accessible to the public. Making it available would help those who want to protect themselves act accordingly."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Likewise, Marcel Tanner, a professor emeritus of public health at the University of Basel and a former member of the Covid Task Force, said: "After everything we've learned, it would be logical for anyone with a cold to wear a mask, at least on public transportation."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;The current Covid situation in the UK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on the most recent figures from the UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA), from October 3, there has been a substantial rise in Covid cases per week. In the week ending September 24, there were 2,459 newly confirmed cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, by September 10, there was a 7.6 per cent spike in cases across England compared to the previous week. The majority of these fresh cases are being fuelled by the new Stratus strain of Coronavirus, which has two variants - XFG and XFG. 3.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new variant has been flagged for potentially causing a significantly severe hoarse voice, in addition to the usual symptoms such as fever and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, experts have emphasised that current data does not suggest this variant is any more deadly than other variants currently in circulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Allen from the UKHSA stated: "Based on the available information so far, there is no evidence to suggest that the XFG and XFG.3 variants cause more severe disease than previous variants, or that the vaccines in current use will be less effective against them."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the World Health Organisation has classified the XFG strand as posing a 'low risk' globally. It said: "XFG is growing rapidly compared to co-circulating variants globally. However, XFG exhibits only marginal additional immune evasion over [other variant] LP.8.1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"While there are reported increases in cases and hospitalisations in some of the [southeast Asia region] countries, which has the highest proportion of XFG, there are no reports to suggest that the associated disease severity is higher as compared to other circulating variants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The available evidence on XFG does not suggest additional public health risks relative to the other currently circulating Omicron descendant lineages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Glasgow Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 12:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5vdjhNN3VzSVhyT0JrVW5VQWlvWTRjMW9JQmJOSUdnT0FQWkpHVEE4NWhqdEdEakx2WWlyTTRGZHRyZWl5RjhjVHQ2cmYyeEVXbFRQUUhVTFNEYzVlR01KVkxNZGRhbjhXbDZjVHJTSEwtUHRGTktiZmNPSdIBgAFBVV95cUxNcWRtd3V1ek9WSjBRNnhoUnM5QjQ1aTdXUllGWTZtbTJWcVNKWWxaRjJNakhhNm5LNm1KWjJZUHRuY3lFbVpqM2NmNW0xeUhJWlpFVWxLR3d2anJpMWFaX3NWemNRSlBhY3hPcm9icFlHYzBXbW0yZHVBN3NfWVVNVg</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎专家建议在疫情结束仅三年后再次佩戴口罩- The Mirror</title><link>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/health/wear-a-face-mask-covid-36026620</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_4d0286" publication="mirror"&gt;Covid experts advise wearing masks again just three years after pandemic ended&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_1cc836" data-testid="leadtext" publication="mirror"&gt;Some people are being urged to start wearing face masks again as we enter the winter period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_byline-container__K_Owl" data-testid="byline"&gt;&lt;span data-testid="byline-content" class="Byline_byline-content-wrapper__Imque"&gt;&lt;div class="Byline_author-badge-date-wrapper__Q7jj1"&gt;&lt;p class="Byline_dates-container__Rqzf2"&gt;&lt;span class="" data-testid="byline-publishedDate"&gt;13:16, 07 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="Byline_updated-date__8vEV8 Byline_updated-date-with-published__ApG_G" data-testid="byline-updatedDate"&gt;Updated 13:21, 07 Oct 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="LightboxBtn_lightbox-btn__eoxYS" aria-label="Open image viewer" aria-haspopup="dialog" aria-controls="image-lightbox"&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage" data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="36026878"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ImageEmbed_fig-caption__qotOK"&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_camera-style__Qjeby"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 16 16" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;g clip-path="url(#clip0_209_94274)"&gt;&lt;path opacity="0.16" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M14 4H2V10.6667C2 11.403 2.59695 12 3.33333 12H12.6667C13.403 12 14 11.403 14 10.6667V4ZM8 10C9.10457 10 10 9.10457 10 8C10 6.89543 9.10457 6 8 6C6.89543 6 6 6.89543 6 8C6 9.10457 6.89543 10 8 10Z" fill="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;path d="M2 3.33331H14V11.3333C14 12.0697 13.403 12.6666 12.6667 12.6666H3.33333C2.59695 12.6666 2 12.0697 2 11.3333V3.33331Z" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M11.3332 1.33331L12.6665 1.33331" stroke="var(--color-sem-icon-primary-default)" stroke-width="1.33333" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;defs&gt;&lt;clippath id="clip0_209_94274"&gt;&lt;rect fill="white"&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;/clippath&gt;&lt;/defs&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-title__FSINC"&gt;Some people are being asked to wear face masks once again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ImageEmbed_caption-credit__uNiU6"&gt;(Image: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh " data-tmdatatrack="content-unit" data-tmdatatrack-type="paragraph" publication="mirror"&gt;Swiss&lt;a class="TextLink_text-link__dBSS0 TextLink_enabled__dJF3l" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronavirus" target="_self" aria-label="" tabindex="0"&gt; Covid experts &lt;/a&gt;are saying members of the public should start wearing face masks again, just three years after the Covid-19 pandemic officially ended.

                Insecticide-treated bed nets keep mosquitoes from biting at night, but what how do you protect babies when they're out and about? One researcher had an idea that involved the traditional bab-carrying wrap used in sub-Saharan Africa.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Babies may soon join soldiers in the fight to ward off malaria.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, the U.S. military has treated uniforms with insecticide to repel mosquitoes and the malaria they can transmit. &lt;a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/medicine/infdis/people/ross-boyce-md-msc/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ross Boyce&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used to wear one before becoming an infectious disease physician and malaria researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He wondered if babies could get similar protection – not from a uniform but by treating the baby wraps that many moms in sub-Saharan Africa use to carry their little ones.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It seems sort of an obvious thing to do," he says, especially given the risk — nearly every minute, a child under 5 in sub-Saharan Africa dies from malaria. Plus, existing tools like insecticide-treated &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/11/22/503036774/the-new-debate-over-bed-nets" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bed nets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can only protect kids while they're sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So Boyce and his colleagues tested this idea in a large randomized controlled trial. In a rural part of western Uganda, 200 mothers with kids between 6 and 18 months got a permethrin-soaked baby wrap, while 200 others got a wrap just soaked in water. All participants got a brand-new treated bed net too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the course of 6 months, the young participants visited clinics every two weeks to be checked for malaria symptoms and tested. The team also looked for side effects. Every four weeks, the researchers re-soaked the wraps in case the permethrin wore off. "That was probably overkill," says Boyce. "But we really wanted to know, if we have enough permethrin in there, does it work?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The answer: a resounding yes. "It was a level of effect that was beyond even our wildest expectations," says Boyce.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over 6 months, 34 kids in the permethrin-wrap group tested positive for malaria, compared with 94 in the water-soaked wrap group, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2501628" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a reduction of about 65%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's a really large reduction, surprisingly so," says &lt;a href="https://sph.tulane.edu/trmd/thom-eisele" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thomas Eisele&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a malaria researcher at Tulane University who wasn't involved in the study. The scale of the reduction suggests mosquitoes are biting more often than thought during the daytime, he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We've hit a brick wall where we just weren't making progress with our existing tools," says Eisele. "These types of interventions are going to be critical."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The major reductions didn't seem to come with major side effects over the course of the experiment, which was a worry. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/11/627843581/if-you-spray-your-clothes-with-permethrin-be-careful-around-the-cat" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Permethrin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can cause growth and neurological problems if ingested at high levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When [permethrin] is treated on fabric, there's much less transmission through the skin," he says.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Plus, kids were generally clothed underneath the wrap, so there wasn't much direct contact. Still, about 8.5% of babies had a mild rash in the treatment group compared with 6% in the control.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nothing is zero risk, and it's a tradeoff that needs to be considered," he says, "but we know getting malaria is not good for children either."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In the real world, retreating the wraps as often as they did during the experiment could be impractical, says Boyce. But it also may not be necessary since manufacturers are able to create long-lasting permethrin-treated garments.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Down the line, Boyce imagines mothers could get a long-lasting wrap when they come to clinics to get vaccines, providing some extra protection before the babies start walking around on their own.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However the rollout might work, demand would be high, predicts study co-author &lt;a href="https://scispace.com/authors/edgar-mulogo-6r142y3bct" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Edgar Mulogo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at Mbara University in Uganda. "The excitement to use [the wraps] was just tremendous," he says. He heard one participant say "when the children were under the wraps, they were not getting bitten."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

            Most Americans with health insurance should not have to pay out of pocket for Covid-19 vaccines, even after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added an extra hurdle to getting the shot. But some people could face new costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6m90002356ng3l57x4g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC adopted its &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F09%2F19%2Fhealth%2Fcdc-acip-hepatitis-mmrv-covid-vaccine&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7C52f04ba9b3bd4446259a08de0502fa5b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638953707507123670%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=zXUXbx06rkpD4C0bYjhwvyS0wUIOvJh1y8Tcn7E1HiY%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;vaccine advisers’ vote&lt;/a&gt; to shift away from a broad recommendation for Covid-19 immunization; people who want one must now consult with a health care provider, a process known as shared clinical decision-making. However, a prescription is not necessarily needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0003356nhsph25kd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the change raised concerns that insurers would no longer be required to cover the full cost of the immunization. The Affordable Care Act mandates that most private insurers cover vaccines recommended by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, at no cost. Meanwhile, Medicaid’s no-cost coverage of vaccines is also tied to the committee’s recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0004356n2j3rcn2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            (Medicare is required by law to cover the Covid-19 vaccine with no cost-sharing, so it is not affected by the committee’s recommendation.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0005356npitxukdg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC committee’s vote “provides for immunization coverage through all payment mechanisms including entitlement programs such as Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicaid, and Medicare, as well as insurance plans through the federal Health Insurance Marketplace,” a US Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said in a statement last month.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0006356nw2yfrl0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, it may not be that cut-and-dry, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma0007356nwbnu3z6y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Insurers may not unanimously agree that they have to cover vaccines with shared decision-making recommendations at no cost, although the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;CDC&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;has attempted to clarify that such recommendations should fall under Obamacare’s mandate, said Amy Killelea, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. That injects “ambiguity” into the extent of the coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Many private insurance plans are regulated by a trio of departments: Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury, which have not issued guidance on shared decision-making. Other private plans are regulated by states, at least 13 of which have taken steps to require the insurers they regulate to continue to provide Covid-19 vaccines for free to patients, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kff.org%2Fcovid-19%2Ftracking-state-actions-on-vaccine-policy-and-access%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CTami.Luhby%40cnn.com%7C52f04ba9b3bd4446259a08de0502fa5b%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638953707507144725%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=mfvLLlNtPvAgdgbcRznhOylLtcxHgvDlnWiYHqrpVWE%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, a nonpartisan health policy research group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The nation’s largest trade association for health insurers said its members – which cover more than 200 million Americans – indicated that any recommendations stemming from the committee’s meeting would not have an impact on policyholders’ coverage through the end of 2026.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000a356nepi5kh3y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            AHIP, formerly America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement before the ACIP meeting in September that its members would continue to cover all immunizations that the committee had recommended as of September 1 at no cost to patients. This includes the updated Covid-19 vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000b356npe58kf4x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Health plans are committed to maintaining and ensuring affordable access to vaccines,” said the association, which told CNN that shared decision-making recommendations must be covered without cost-sharing. “Health plan coverage decisions for immunizations are grounded in each plan’s ongoing, rigorous review of scientific and clinical evidence, and continual evaluation of multiple sources of data.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000c356n7r7iba53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Similarly, UnitedHealthcare said it will fully cover Covid-19 vaccines recommended by ACIP as of January 1 in its standard commercial plans, although it noted that people who have certain job-based policies should check with their employers. UnitedHealthcare, which is not an AHIP member, is the nation’s largest insurer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000d356nn438vs7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “UnitedHealthcare is committed to enabling access to safe, effective and affordable care, including coverage for vaccinations,” the company said in a statement after last month’s ACIP vote. “Vaccines are an important and effective way to protect the health of individuals, families and communities, and members should talk with their health care providers to determine if a vaccine is clinically appropriate.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000e356nm0l8xtvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The insurer noted that its “coverage will remain guided by federal and state mandates as well as the available clinical evidence, including the recommendations of professional societies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000f356nst8qq8rd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers will cover all vaccines recommended by the committee&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;January 1 with no cost to patients through the end of next year, while operating within federal and state laws, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000g356n2w6dji0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But some insurers could now argue that they aren’t mandated to pick up the entire tab for the Covid-19 vaccine, which costs about $140.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000h356nrvjcil4o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s nothing that requires insurers to cover vaccines not recommended by ACIP at no cost,” Killelea said. “Where it could be ambiguous is whether all insurers will view a shared decision-making recommendation as a full recommendation from ACIP.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000i356nqnnvkfsx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medicaid enrollees will continue to receive the vaccine at no cost, per earlier guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Killelea said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000j356nd36dwl4u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Separately, the CDC advisory committee also voted that the combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine would no longer be recommended before age 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000k356nyt0u209y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means private insurers will not be required to cover it at no cost, so if parents want their children to have the combined vaccine, they could have to pay for it – if they could get it at all, said Jen Kates, senior vice president at KFF. Vaccine makers may not continue to manufacture it, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000l356ncqkk9a1i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, the combined vaccine will no longer be automatically covered by Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, though states could opt to do so.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000m356nub1vm3z3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The CDC committee voted not to have the MMRV immunization covered by the Vaccines for Children program, which provides access for low-income children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgfjl6ma000n356nudd6jyoh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The separate vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella and against varicella, the virus that causes chickenpox, will continue to be recommended and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;will be covered at no cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Hermina Nedelescu, a neuroscientist at the institute and study co-author, added: 'It shows us which circuits are recruited when the brain links alcohol with relief from stress—and that could be a game changer in how we think about relapse.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like other drug addictions, alcohol addiction is characterised by cycles of withdrawal, sobriety and relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that when rats were initially given alcohol, they learnt to associate it with pleasure and seek more alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Interestingly, the researchers noted that this connection was stronger after a few cycles of withdrawal and relapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After learning that drinking eased the unpleasant feelings of withdrawal—such as loss of appetite, nausea, depression, agitation and fatigue—the rats sought out more alcohol and would remain persistent even in uncomfortable situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When rats learn to associate environmental stimuli or context with the experience of relief, they end up with an incredibly powerful urge to seek alcohol in the presence of that stimuli—even if conditions are introduced that require great effort to engage in alcohol seeking,' Prof Weiss explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That is, these rats seek alcohol even if that behaviour is punished.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded that this negative reinforcement—the drive to act in order to escape pain or stress—and the activation of the PVT in the brain in response is crucial for how we learn and perpetuate addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nedelescu added: 'This work has potential applications not only for alcohol addiction, but also other disorders where people get trapped in harmful cycles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers now hope to expand the study to look at gender-specific behaviours  to pinpoint the exact molecules and neurochemicals that are involved in the brain processes driving so many people to the bottle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weiss added: 'As psychologists, we've long known that addiction isn't just about causing pleasure—it's about escaping those negative hedonic states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study shows us where in the brain that learning takes root, which is a step forward.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest official figures shows deaths from alcohol have soared to a record high in Britain with almost 10,5000 alcohol-related deaths in 2023 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The WHO estimate it kills three million people around the world each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS recommends people drink no more than 14 units of alcohol per week—the equivalent of six pints of beer, or six medium glasses of wine—spread out over at least three days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, experts have recently warned that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15126395/NO-safe-alcohol-dementia-risk-experts-study.html"&gt;no amount of alcohol is 'safe'&lt;/a&gt;, adding that slashing alcohol intake could 'play a significant role in dementia prevention'.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent polls suggests that the average Briton drinks roughly 18 units of alcohol a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those concerned they may have a problem with alcohol should visit their GP, who can make an assessment and refer them to specialist clinics for counselling and help with withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Withdrawal symptoms, including anxiety, shakiness, vomiting and fast heart rate, usually resolve within a week, according to the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular drinking has also been linked to increased risks of high blood pressure, liver disease and several cancers, according to the NHS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"The front door for these viruses is our nose and that tissue right in the back of our noses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2838335"&gt;The German study of 450 adults published&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 2 found that those who took azelastine — an antihistamine sold under the brand names Astepro and Astelin — were much less likely to contract viral infections than those who took a placebo. It came after other recent research also suggested that different types of nasal sprays may prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner, who was not involved in the study, said more testing is needed, because the study involved relatively small numbers of people or were done on animals. Larger studies will determine how effective the sprays are in the real world, and at what dosages and frequencies, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="summary secondaryBox_summary__WyWVT"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;WHAT NEWSDAY FOUND&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research over the past few years&lt;/strong&gt; has suggested that nasal sprays could help prevent COVID-19, the flu and the common cold, although larger studies are needed to confirm findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A study released last month found that azelastine,&lt;/strong&gt; an antihistamine, significantly reduced the chance of getting ill from COVID-19 or the common cold. Researchers say it could potentially be used before going into high-risk situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;have been developed that, &lt;/b&gt;early research indicates, could almost fully block virus transmission. But they likely would have to be used once or multiple times a day, and experts believe people are unlikely to do that for year-round protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, he said, viruses must attach to and enter cells to make you sick, and the most common entry point for respiratory viruses is the nose. Scientists believe that medications given through the nose have the potential to be more effective than those injected into the body because they attack or block the virus at the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner said that &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-hhs-rfk-flu-vaccine-nih-grant-taubenberger/"&gt;Trump administration funding cutbacks and shifts&lt;/a&gt; in how it approaches COVID-19 vaccines are taking away money from nasal-spray initiatives and could delay the development of nasal vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="img Image_img__VNXHO landscape lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="Azelastine, an antihistamine, also showed promise preventing viral infections." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=828&amp;amp;q=80 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AYzA4ZTg1OWEtNTY5MC00%3ANjg0NmY3MzUtZmM3OC00%2Fcopy-of-linasal251004_photos.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D768%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=1920&amp;amp;q=80"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azelastine, an antihistamine, also showed promise preventing viral infections. Credit: Alamy Stock Photo/Wladimir Bulgar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those receiving azelastine in the antihistamine study used it three times a day for an average of 56 days. Researchers found they were about three times less likely to become infected with COVID-19 or with rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold, than people who didn't. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32546-z"&gt;A previous, smaller study on azelastine&lt;/a&gt; had roughly similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early antihistamine doubts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antihistamines work by blocking a chemical that causes allergic symptoms. Because of that, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Stony Brook Medicine, said she and other physicians wondered whether antihistamines could protect against the coronavirus. But, she said, anecdotally "it did not seem to make a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What may be different today is that almost everyone has either contracted COVID-19 or received a COVID-19 vaccine, and that could lead to a different type of immune system response, Nachman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She cautioned against anyone using azelastine to prevent COVID-19 or colds until after a larger study is conducted and analyzed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have had mixed results in looking at other nasal sprays, such as those made from nitric oxide and a red seaweed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on nasal sprays is not new. There is a federally approved nasal spray — FluMist — used as a flu vaccine. It was first approved for some age groups in 2003 and is about as effective as a traditional shot, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in research into nasal sprays in recent years is in part because of efforts to find more effective vaccines against COVID-19, said Dr. Paul Spearman, vice chair for clinical and translational research and education at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing severe disease, but their ability to prevent transmission wanes within weeks after the shot is given, research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you could make a vaccine that prevented the initial infection or prevented the spread, then that would be two steps up above what we've got now," Spearman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Promising nose gel&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard Medical School and Boston's Brigham and Women’s Hospital last year said they developed &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/drug-free-nasal-spray-may-shield-against-respiratory-infections"&gt;a gel-like spray that coats&lt;/a&gt; the inner lining of the nose and was almost 100% effective in blocking viruses from infecting the noses of mice, and in a 3D model of the human nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is other research also looking at gels. But the gel must be reapplied to remain effective, Spearman said. In the Harvard research, it remained protective for up to eight hours. It’s unlikely most people would apply a gel every day or multiple times a day for the entire year to prevent getting a cold or COVID-19, Spearman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The azelastine findings also indicate that sustained use of the antihistamine is needed to provide protection. The study’s authors said it could be used before going into "high-risk settings, such as large gatherings or travel." But more research is needed to determine how often and for how many days it should be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spearman led &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw0896"&gt;the first U.S. human clinical trial &lt;/a&gt;of a nasal COVID-19 vaccine — released in July — that showed that people who received higher doses of the spray were significantly less likely to have COVID-19 symptoms than those getting a low dose. It was of 61 people, and a much larger study is needed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spearman said generating an immune response in the nose offers great promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you do that, then whenever the virus comes around, your immune cells just take care of it, and ideally, you'd prevent the virus from then getting into the lung or getting in anywhere else where it would make you sick," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="byline Byline_byline__7W6Ao ux Byline_ux__K0907 bot Byline_bot__Vn8AK"&gt;&lt;span class="author-image Byline_author-image__kHthS"&gt;&lt;img alt="David Olson" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=96&amp;amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75 2x" src="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AOGVlNWFiZDYtNTE4ZS00%3AZDYtNTE4ZS00MWQ4NDRi%2Fimage.jpg%3Ff%3DMugshot%26w%3D100%26q%3D1&amp;amp;w=256&amp;amp;q=75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;

People with this condition have a possible risk for more significant liver problems or other conditions like cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study focused on how sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages related to liver health. Based on analysis of over 103,000 participants, higher consumption of both beverage types was linked to a higher risk for MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were linked to a greater risk for liver-related mortality. While the study hasn’t been published yet, the findings shed light on the potential risks of these beverages, particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study results were presented at &lt;a href="https://ueg.eu/week" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UEG Week 2025;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UEG Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the annual congress of United European Gastroenterology. They are yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Drinking more than 1 can of any soda daily linked to liver problems&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective cohort study where researchers used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers examined data from 103,251 participants who did not have baseline liver disease. The median follow-up was a little over 10 years, and during this time “949 participants developed MASLD, and 103 died from liver-related causes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported on their consumption of sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages. Researchers were also able to consider participants’ liver fat content based on MRI data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at the associations between drinking these beverages and someone’s risk for MASLD. They also looked at liver-related mortality and liver-fat content and their association with the related beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consuming more than 330 grams (g), or about 1 can, of drinks from either beverage category daily was associated with a higher risk for developing MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with about a 50% greater risk for MASLD, and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with 60% greater risk. The results also found that consuming either beverage type was linked to liver fat content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, drinking low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with an increased risk for liver-related mortality, but sugar-sweetened beverages did not have a significant association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the association between low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages and liver-related mortality was dose-dependent; drinking more was linked to a higher risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Swapping soda for water helps lower liver disease risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at substituting beverages, researchers found that switching out 330 g of either beverage type daily for water helped to decrease risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect was a little larger when switching out sugar-sweetened beverages for water, which decreased MASLD risk by 14.7%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that switching out the beverage types for each other did not change the risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the potential danger of both beverages, but particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages, on liver outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lihe-Liu-2274143134" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lihe Liu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lihe Liu&lt;/a&gt;, a graduate student in the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China, explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that low- or non-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs), often seen as healthier alternatives because they use sugar substitutes, may not be entirely risk-free. We found that frequent consumption was still linked with liver health risks, which challenges the common belief that these drinks are completely ‘safe’ or ‘healthy’ substitutes for sugary beverages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Study limitations and continued research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, which makes it challenging to know the full limitations of the research. However, beverage intake was something reported by participants, which may not have been their true intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also does not establish that consumption of these beverages causes liver problems. It’s also unclear what covariates researchers adjusted for in their analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank is has its own limitations too, including the fact that it includes &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:primarily white participants;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;primarily white participants&lt;/a&gt;, and they tend to be healthier than the United Kingdom’s general population. For this reason, additional follow-up research will be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Liu explained the next steps to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, saying that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to complete and submit the full manuscript for peer review and publication, which will allow the scientific community to scrutinize and build upon our findings. Looking ahead, more research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms linking artificially sweetened beverages to liver disease, and to explore whether different types of sweeteners carry different risks. Long-term studies in more diverse populations will also be important to strengthen the evidence base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the clinical implications?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is required, the findings do give another reason for avoiding drinks like soda and their diet counterparts. It also highlights that opting for water instead may help to decrease MASLD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks may carry risks for liver health. Clinically, this highlights the need to guide people toward healthier beverage choices, with water remaining the safest and healthiest option,” Liu explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.eatwell2livebetter.com/about.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karen Z.

I highly encourage all patients to stick with water, or carbonated water, for the best health outcomes. Just because something says ‘zero calories’ or ‘less sugar’ [it] does not automatically equate with [being] healthier. There are a lot of chemicals that go into those beverages to give them the flavors people crave. Plain water, fruit infused water (homemade), unsweetened homemade iced tea, or seltzer [are] the way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diet-and-regular-sodas-are-linked-to-liver-disease/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 11:06:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFA3Q0hRMC1OSm1ZdDVzaDVkZ0VCUm1ES2FpNDMxVU9PQ3pfNHZaYWs4cFRTSm1mMUtjUldsZ2xMMy1lSFl6SUY5VVBHYzhGS3JkbEQ1bHpfblZ6aXZmYXFsaUhNNjdEX3JkN0U0dzBCcmRaVmtoSHM3SWJYX3BMR2c</guid></item><item><title>医生揭示了GLP-1s最常见的副作用—以及如何管理它们- HuffPost</title><link>https://www.huffpost.com/entry/side-effects-ozempic-wegovy-glp-1_l_68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, GLP-1 medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound have ballooned in popularity.

And the potential side effects are related to the fact that they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; so powerful, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While not everyone who takes GLP-1s will have side effects, some will, and they can range from mild to life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, doctors share the most common side effects of GLP-1 medications and how best to avoid these symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vomiting, nausea and other gastrointestinal issues are common.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most commonly reported side effects are GI-related: nausea, constipation, loose stools, vomiting,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these don’t happen to everyone. In clinical trials, nausea was the most commonly reported side effect and impacted 44% of people, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These meds are mimicking a natural hormone [GLP-1] and amplifying it ... so, you can imagine it will impact people differently, because just how sensitive you are to these hormones. So the side effects that are most common are related to the impact of the medication [and] the impact it has on the movement of the food,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medication slows down the movement of food through your gut, Parrella said, which makes the above gastrointestinal symptoms common, in addition to things such as acid reflux, heartburn and burping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dehydration and a lack of nutrients can happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people who take GLP-1s don’t get hunger and thirst signals as often as they would off of the medication, Lofton said. While this is a common occurrence, it can lead to problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some individuals, they might not be eating enough or drinking enough fluids, so it can cause risks related to dehydration or not having enough electrolytes, or possibly not eating enough nutrients, such as protein or fiber,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often get fuller faster, which leads to less food consumption and, in turn, fewer necessary nutrients, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are more serious adverse effects, too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the [adverse] effects that people will talk about ... would be pancreatitis, and that’s an inflammation in the pancreas. ... This medication is intended to make your pancreas work a little bit [harder], so that it pumps out more insulin when you eat foods that increase blood glucose,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, basically, the starchy carbs and the sugary foods, if you eat those, your pancreas has to work harder with these medications, and it pumps out a lot more insulin than usual,” she noted. This overactivity can cause pancreatitis in some people, Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gallstones and gallbladder inflammation are also associated with the use of GLP-1s, Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, if someone vomits too much, they become dehydrated, which can cause kidney failure,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intestinal obstruction can also occur, which is when “food stops moving through because it gets stuck,” Parrella said. Dehydration and a lack of movement of the gut can cause this food pileup, Parrella noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all health issues that require immediate medical attention, but confusingly, the signs of these problems often overlap with some of the less serious side effects of GLP-1s — vomiting, nausea, indigestion and more — both doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s also this very small but serious risk of what’s called gastroparesis, which is basically where your stomach stops moving the food forward,” Parrella said. This is a permanent issue that isn’t fixed when someone stops taking the medication, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://federal-lawyer.com/injury-lawsuit/ozempic/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="There is currently litigation" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://federal-lawyer.com/injury-lawsuit/ozempic/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;There is currently litigation&lt;/a&gt; around this issue and lots of medical concerns, as it’s hard to predict who this may happen to, Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Illustration: HuffPost; Photo: Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;GLP-1 medications such as Wegovy and Ozempic can cause side effects including vomiting, nausea, gum disease and more.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They can cause dental decay and gum disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-walton-522b4826" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Dr. Elizabeth Walton" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-walton-522b4826" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Walton&lt;/a&gt;, clinical director at &lt;a href="https://risasdental.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Risas Kids Dental" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68dfc95ee4b0dbcd325f1c9f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://risasdental.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Risas Kids Dental&lt;/a&gt;, when it comes to dental health, the most common side effects of the use of GLP-1s are an increase in gum disease and dental decay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 medications reduce saliva production. “Patients taking GLP-1s often experience symptoms of dry mouth, which include increased cavities and periodontal disease,” Walton told HuffPost via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Saliva produces a protective barrier over our teeth and lubricates our [gums],” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With less saliva in our mouths, we are more exposed to the acids created by bacteria that lead to gum disease and dental cavities,” noted Walton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have any side effects, you should let your doctor know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell my patients if they have vomiting even once, they should call my office because vomiting can be a symptom of some of the other more dangerous adverse effects,” Lofton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your symptoms persist or get worse, you should certainly tell your doctor, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the side effects of these medications are sometimes talked about among those on GLP-1s, it doesn’t make them normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many people will say, ‘I’m just going to suck it up. I know nausea is normal,’ or ‘I know it’s common to have constipation on these meds. This is probably no big deal. It’s just how these meds work,’ or ‘I’m worried my doctor will stop prescribing this medicine for me if I complain’ ... and that’s when it becomes a problem,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When symptoms continue or worsen, it’s a sign from the body that something is wrong, she noted. “And when we ignore that, or don’t report, it then becomes very difficult to prevent the longer, more serious problems,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To combat some of these symptoms, you should follow a few rules when taking this medication.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important that you focus on drinking lots of fluids and staying hydrated as you take GLP-1s, Parrella said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;More, you should prioritize your protein intake so you can maintain and build muscle as you are on the medication, she said. To further help muscle growth and maintenance, add strength training to your workout regimen, Parrella added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then the third thing would be, because this slows the movement of food through the gut, you want to make sure you stop eating three [to four] hours before bedtime,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you lie down after eating, it’s easy for the food to come back up and cause issues like heartburn and acid reflux, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There isn’t long-term research on GLP-1s, so some of the risks are unknown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s important if somebody does start experiencing some new symptoms of any kind on these medications, we have to remember we don’t have very long-term data on these meds, so there are still a lot of unknown risks with these medications,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do they cause cancer? What happens if you stop? Does it cause a metabolic rebound? What about interactions with populations outside of those who have been tested?” she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medical professionals are excited about understanding this new space in medicine, it’s also important that those who use GLP-1s remain cautious and informed of the risks, benefits and proper usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You also have to pay attention to the effect on your own body. So, if you don’t feel good, or you are having symptoms of any kind, be in communication with your doctor so that you have a partner in the process,” Parrella said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you should consider the risk versus the benefit when it comes to GLP-1s (and all medications), Lofton said. “This comes into play when we think about people who aren’t having a weight condition,” Lofton added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry-support-huffpost-mid-article" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;20 Years Of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Journalism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--first"&gt;Your Support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--second"&gt;Fuels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cli-support-huffpost__title--third"&gt;Our Mission&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--main"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-support-huffpost__sub-headline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Image credit: SKC/Stocksy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet versions of beverages are often hailed as healthier than the sugar-sweetened original versions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research is ongoing regarding the potential dangers of sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened drinks. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent study results identified a link between drinking higher amounts of sugar-sweetened beverages and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages and an increased risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A recent study focused on how sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages related to liver health. Based on analysis of over 103,000 participants, higher consumption of both beverage types was linked to a higher risk for MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were linked to a greater risk for liver-related mortality. While the study hasn’t been published yet, the findings shed light on the potential risks of these beverages, particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study results were presented at &lt;a href="https://ueg.eu/week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UEG Week 2025&lt;/a&gt;, the annual congress of United European Gastroenterology. They are yet to appear in a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was a prospective cohort study where researchers used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers examined data from 103,251 participants who did not have baseline liver disease. The median follow-up was a little over 10 years, and during this time “949 participants developed MASLD, and 103 died from liver-related causes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants reported on their consumption of sugar-sweetened and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages. Researchers were also able to consider participants’ liver fat content based on MRI data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at the associations between drinking these beverages and someone’s risk for MASLD. They also looked at liver-related mortality and liver-fat content and their association with the related beverages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consuming more than 330 grams (g), or about 1 can, of drinks from either beverage category daily was associated with a higher risk for developing MASLD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with about a 50% greater risk for MASLD, and low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with 60% greater risk. The results also found that consuming either beverage type was linked to liver fat content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, drinking low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with an increased risk for liver-related mortality, but sugar-sweetened beverages did not have a significant association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the association between low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages and liver-related mortality was dose-dependent; drinking more was linked to a higher risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking at substituting beverages, researchers found that switching out 330 g of either beverage type daily for water helped to decrease risk for MASLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The effect was a little larger when switching out sugar-sweetened beverages for water, which decreased MASLD risk by 14.7%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that switching out the beverage types for each other did not change the risk for MASLD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the potential danger of both beverages, but particularly low or non-sugar-sweetened beverages, on liver outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Lihe-Liu-2274143134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Lihe Liu&lt;/a&gt;, a graduate student in the Department of Gastroenterology at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University in Suzhou, China, explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research shows that low- or non-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs), often seen as healthier alternatives because they use sugar substitutes, may not be entirely risk-free. We found that frequent consumption was still linked with liver health risks, which challenges the common belief that these drinks are completely ‘safe’ or ‘healthy’ substitutes for sugary beverages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal yet, which makes it challenging to know the full limitations of the research. However, beverage intake was something reported by participants, which may not have been their true intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also does not establish that consumption of these beverages causes liver problems. It’s also unclear what covariates researchers adjusted for in their analyses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK Biobank is has its own limitations too, including the fact that it includes &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-our-data/our-participants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;primarily white participants&lt;/a&gt;, and they tend to be healthier than the United Kingdom’s general population. For this reason, additional follow-up research will be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Liu explained the next steps to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;, saying that: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next step is to complete and submit the full manuscript for peer review and publication, which will allow the scientific community to scrutinize and build upon our findings. Looking ahead, more research is needed to clarify the biological mechanisms linking artificially sweetened beverages to liver disease, and to explore whether different types of sweeteners carry different risks. Long-term studies in more diverse populations will also be important to strengthen the evidence base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While more research is required, the findings do give another reason for avoiding drinks like soda and their diet counterparts. It also highlights that opting for water instead may help to decrease MASLD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate that both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks may carry risks for liver health. Clinically, this highlights the need to guide people toward healthier beverage choices, with water remaining the safest and healthiest option,” Liu explained to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.eatwell2livebetter.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Karen Z. Berg&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, CSO, CDN, who was not involved in this research, advised that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people have the misconception that diet drinks are healthier for you than regular drinks, but this study demonstrates how both are positively associated with MASLD. I highly encourage all patients to stick with water, or carbonated water, for the best health outcomes. Just because something says ‘zero calories’ or ‘less sugar’ [it] does not automatically equate with [being] healthier. There are a lot of chemicals that go into those beverages to give them the flavors people crave. Plain water, fruit infused water (homemade), unsweetened homemade iced tea, or seltzer [are] the way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 10:52:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxPTi02VW04VzVLc25ILTBsQTdkZzdDS1lnaWQ0Y3lxWWVtS3UwOTNQMll2X0FKVEsyUG9SOXRyWmhiRmxCTmZYM1NULWpSUE9naHlIcmQ5bDBXb1VRd3JuZDZIYXdMeENBZHNtaWlPYzR3X1hfc1VMYTI0NzhaNFJ3cVZMZk05RFA2cjdWSUo1MHUxSU9zS2tr</guid></item><item><title>甜味剂和甜度增强剂对超重或肥胖个体体重管理和肠道微生物群组成的影响： SWEET研究-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01381-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec13-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec14"&gt;Ethics statement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (&lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04226911"&gt;NCT04226911&lt;/a&gt;), was approved by national ethical committees (protocols and amendments) and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

All participants provided written informed consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec15"&gt;Trial design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SWEET trial was a two-armed parallel group RCT conducted at four intervention sites: Athens (Harokopio University of Athens, Greece), Copenhagen (University of Copenhagen, Denmark), Maastricht (Maastricht University, the Netherlands) and Pamplona (University of Navarra, Spain), effectively covering northern, central, southern and south-eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1-year RCT consisted of an initial 2-month weight loss period followed by a 10-month, randomized, two-armed parallel WM period. The full 1-year trial on which the majority of outcomes are reported (months M0–M12) comprises the combined periods and is thus termed WM. For adults, the goal was first to achieve a weight loss of ≥5% of the initial weight and second, to maintain their new body weight. For children, the first goal was to achieve weight stability and second, to maintain their BMI-for-age &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score. CIDs were carried out at baseline (M0), after weight loss and weight stability (M2) and twice during WM (M6 and M12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec16"&gt;Participants&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 341 adults and 38 children were included in the trial (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s42255-025-01381-z#Fig1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). The analysis of gut microbiota composition was done in a subgroup of 137 adult completers. Participants were enrolled between June 2020 and October 2021. The recruitment procedure and all inclusion and exclusion criteria are described elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Kjølbæk, L. et al.

In brief, 18–65-year-old men and women (self-reported sex) with BMI ≥ 25 kg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and 6–12-year-old boys and girls (self-reported sex) with a BMI-for-age of &amp;gt;85th percentile were included. Children were included in a family setting with at least one recruited parent. Participants were required to have a regular consumption of sugar-containing or sugar-sweetened products. Adult participants were excluded at screening if, for example, they had been surgically treated for obesity, were taking medication affecting body weight, had been diagnosed with diabetes, had a fasting glucose &amp;gt;7.0 mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or had systolic blood pressure of &amp;gt;160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of &amp;gt;100 mmHg. Children were excluded if, for example, they performed &amp;gt;10 h of intensive physical training per week, had self-reported eating disorders, were diagnosed with diabetes or used medication that affected their body weight. All adults received low-energy diet products free of charge. Participants in Copenhagen, Pamplona and Athens did not receive reimbursement for their participation; travel expenses and financial compensation were provided for participants in Maastricht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec17"&gt;Intervention&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial lasted 1 year for each participant. The first CID (M0) was on 24 August 2020, and the last participant’s final visit (M12) was on 6 October 2022. During the initial 2-month period, adults—regardless of randomization—received the low-energy diet (Cambridge Weight Plan). For children, weight stability should be achieved by following the dietary recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics on the prevention, assessment and treatment of overweight and obesity&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Kjølbæk, L. et al.

All participants were randomly allocated to one of two diet groups in a 1:1 ratio by a site-specific, computerized randomization list created by a person in Copenhagen not involved in the RCT. Stratification was done by sex, age (&amp;lt;40 or ≥40 years) and BMI (&amp;lt;30 or ≥30 kg m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) in blocks of four. Each household, including children, was randomized to the same intervention group determined by the oldest member of the household. If there was more than one eligible child per household, it was still the randomization group of the oldest adult participant that determined the child allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although randomization was done after inclusion (at screening), it was not revealed to the participants before completion of the 2-month weight loss or weight stability period. The two ad libitum intervention diets were a healthy diet with &amp;lt;10 E% added sugar, allowing foods and drinks with all types of S&amp;amp;SE products commercially available (S&amp;amp;SEs group), and a healthy diet with &amp;lt;10 E% added sugar, not allowing S&amp;amp;SE products (sugar group). The maximum allowed sugar intake was calculated individually at M2 and recalculated at M6 and then converted to a simple trial-specific unit system (one unit = 10 g sugar). The participants received their maximum unit intake and lists with sugar-rich products, including the unit content. Lists were divided into different categories; for example, drinks, breakfast or desserts. The lists also provided a corresponding product with S&amp;amp;SEs (similar in weight or volume; details described elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Kjølbæk, L. et al.

For the S&amp;amp;SEs group, the aim was to replace as many sugar-containing products as possible with S&amp;amp;SEs products, whereas S&amp;amp;SEs products were not allowed in the sugar group. S&amp;amp;SEs included high-potency sweeteners (for example, aspartame, acesulfame-K, saccharin, thaumatin, neotame, stevia glycosides), polyols (for example, erythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, isomalt, maltitol, lactitol, xylitol), slowly digestible carbohydrates (for example, sucromalt, isomaltulose) and sweet fibres or oligosaccharides (inulin-type oligosaccharides). Owing to the characteristics of the trial, blinding was not possible, but all efforts to blind trial staff taking measurements and doing statistical analyses were made. During the intervention period, participants were supervised by dieticians at least every third month. The goal for adults was to maintain weight loss, and for children, the goal was to maintain BMI-for-age &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score. Further reduction in body weight or BMI-for-age &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-score was allowed if the participant was compliant with the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec18"&gt;Data collection and outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data were collected according to common standard operating procedures, which were used in all intervention sites. Most data were collected at the CIDs after ≥10 h of overnight fast. All data were stored in a central data hub in Copenhagen, from which pseudo-anonymized data can be requested until 2032 through a data-sharing contract. As of 2032, fully anonymized data can be transferred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec19"&gt;Primary outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar1"&gt;Body weight&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a digital scale, with participants wearing underwear or light clothes. Fasting body weight was measured at screening and CIDs, but fasting was not required at other visits.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar2"&gt;Gut microbiota composition&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Participants were selected based on whether they completed the full intervention and whether faecal spot samples were available at all time points. The participants were stratified based on age, sex and centre. Faecal spot samples were collected and immediately frozen (−20 °C) at home by the participants before all CIDs. At CIDs, the faecal spot samples were stored at −80 °C at the intervention sites. Barcoded amplicons from the V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA genes (341 F, 5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′; 785 R, 5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′) were generated using the Illumina two-step PCR protocol, and sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq with the paired-end (2×) 300 bp protocol (Nextera XT index kit). After each PCR step, the products were purified (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit), the size of the PCR products was checked on a fragment analyzer (Advanced Analytical), and concentration was quantified by fluorometric analysis (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit). For genomic DNA isolation, QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kits (Qiagen) were used. All outcomes were determined at M0, M2, M6 and M12. Stool consistency was assessed using BSS for each sample&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 41" title="Lewis, S. &amp;amp; Heaton, K.

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar3"&gt;Anthropometry and body composition&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;The methods for measuring anthropometry (BMI, waist and hip circumference) and body composition (fat percentage, fat mass, fat-free mass and computed visceral adipose tissue (CoreScan software; Encore v.17.0) using Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) have been extensively described elsewhere&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Kjølbæk, L. et al.

                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar4"&gt;Risk factors for T2D and CVD&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Risk factors for T2D include elevated levels of glucose, insulin and HbA1c; for CVD, risk factors include high cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and high blood pressure. During CIDs, fasting venous blood samples were drawn. Whole blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes for HbA1c analysis and immediately stored locally at −80 °C. Blood samples were collected in serum separator tubes for analyses of lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C and HDL-C) and insulin. Whole blood samples with fluoride were collected for glucose analysis, with EDTA for CCK, GLP-1 and EDTA plus aprotinin for ghrelin analysis. All blood samples were centrifuged at 1,500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (serum or plasma) samples were aliquoted and stored locally at −80 °C until shipment to the central lab at Bioiatriki (Athens). Glucose concentration was measured by the enzymatic Hexokinase/G-6-PD method (Alinity c Glucose Reagent Kit 07P55, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser (a clinical chemistry analyser from Abbott). A conversion factor for glucose, from mg dl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 0.0555. Insulin concentration was measured by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Alinity i Insulin Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity i analyser (immunoassay analyser from Abbott). A conversion factor for insulin, from µIU ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to pmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 6. HbA1c was measured by an enzymatic assay (Alinity c Haemoglobin A1c Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser, clinical chemistry (Abbott). One participant had results below the lower detection limit during two CIDs. These latter results were reported as 5.0%. Total cholesterol was measured by an enzymatic assay (Alinity c Cholesterol Reagent kit (Abbott)), and LDL-C and HDL-C were measured by liquid (Alinity c Direct LDL Reagent kit) and accelerator (Alinity c Ultra HDL Reagent kit) selective detergent methods, respectively (both Abbott). All cholesterol concentrations were analysed using an Alinity c analyser. A conversion factor for cholesterol (total, LDL and HDL), from mg dl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 0.02586. Triglycerides were measured by a glycerol phosphate oxidase method (Alinity c Triglyceride Reagent kit, Abbott) using an Alinity c analyser. A conversion factor for triglycerides, from mg dl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to mmol l&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, was applied by multiplying by 0.01129. CCK was measured by a competitive enzyme immunoassay method (RayBio Human CCK Enzyme Immunoassay kit, RayBiotech) using a BioTek Quant analyser (BioTek Instruments). Two participants had results above the range of quantification (4,000 pg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) during two CIDs, and their CCK results were reported as 4,000 pg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar5"&gt;IHL content&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;IHL content was analysed in a subgroup (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 27) of adults at Maastricht (S&amp;amp;SEs group, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15; sugar group, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 12). Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS) was performed using a 3T MR system (Achieva 3T-X Philips Healthcare) at M0, M2 and M12. A 32-channel sense cardiac/torso coil (Philips Healthcare) was used, and a 30 × 30 × 30 mm voxel was placed in the lower hepatic lobe. The STEAM (repetition time, 4,500 ms; echo time, 20 ms; number of signal averages, 128) sequence was used, as described previously&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 42" title="Roumans, K. et al.

VAPOR water suppression was applied, and an additional water reference scan was obtained (number of signal averages, 16). A custom-written MATLAB script (MATLAB 2014b, The MathWorks) was used to post-process the spectra. Phasing, frequency alignment and eddy current correction were all performed on spectra before signal averaging. CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resonance, as a percentage of the sum of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O resonances (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + water)), was used as a parameter of IHL content.&lt;/p&gt;
                
                  &lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="FPar6"&gt;Changes in (serious) AEs and concomitant medication use&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p&gt;Any experienced (serious) AEs or changes in medication use were registered during the CIDs. During the WM period, the participants were asked, regardless of intervention, directly about AEs potentially related to the consumption of S&amp;amp;SEs, including gastrointestinal symptoms and headache.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec21"&gt;Other outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjective appetite sensations over the last 7 days were reported in a questionnaire delivery platform on-site or at home within ±7 days of each CID. The participants answered five questions: (1) how strong was your desire to eat savoury foods; (2) how strong was your desire to eat sweet foods; (3) how satiated have you felt; (4) how hungry have you felt; and (5) how full have you felt? All questions were developed in English and translated into the local language at each site. A visual analogue scale with extremes anchored at each end (0, not at all; 100, extremely) was used. Depending on the device that was used, lines were not necessarily 10 cm long, but the rating was presented as a percentage; for example, a mark at 4 cm on an 8 cm line would correspond to 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec22"&gt;Compliance&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess compliance, participants completed 4-day weighed records of all foods and drinks (three weekdays and one weekend day) at M0 and M12. Only records of a minimum of 3 days were deemed valid and used for further analysis. Daily average intake of energy and macronutrients was calculated by national dietary software at the four intervention sites.

Furthermore, the database was updated with nutritional information of processed foods provided by independent research institutes, food companies and fast-food chains. In Pamplona, food records were manually entered in the online application Nutrium (Nutrium.com), which is based on two food databases (BEDCA &amp;amp; CESNID from Spain and the US Department of Agriculture).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, intake (g) of products with sugar and S&amp;amp;SEs and the corresponding units were estimated.

After correction for dilution, urinary concentrations (ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) were multiplied by 24 h urine volume and converted to daily excretions (mg day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Urinary urea concentration was analysed locally and converted to daily urinary nitrogen excretion (g day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) by multiplying urea excretion (g day&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) by 0.4664. At Copenhagen and Maastricht, urea was measured by an enzymatic UV test (colourimetry) (ABX Pentra Urea CP, Horiba ABX) using an ABX Pentra 400.

At Pamplona, urea was measured by an enzymatic kinetic test (COBAS 8000, Roche Diagnostics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the per-protocol population, participants’ compliance was estimated using points (minimum zero points and maximum four points) in relation to four criteria: intake of sugar units and S&amp;amp;SE units and urinary excretion of S&amp;amp;SEs at M6 and at M12. In three out of the four criteria, 75% of the group with the highest (&amp;gt;Q1) or lowest (&amp;lt;Q3) value—depending on the outcome assessed—received one point, and the remaining 25% received no points.

With an estimated dropout of 30%, a minimum of 330 adult participants should be included (approximately 25% per intervention site). The sample size for the 1-year change in gut microbiota required a minimum of 100 participants (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 50 per intervention group) and was based on a calculation taking into account ~10% change in 20 of the 50 most abundant operational taxonomic units with an alpha of &amp;lt;0.05%.

Given that randomization was completed at M0 (that is, 2 months before the 10-month intervention period was initiated), differences in the participant characteristics between groups after weight loss or weight stability (M2) and in changes during the 2-month period (M2–M0) were analysed by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusted for sex, age, baseline body weight and site.

The trial was not powered to analyse data from men and women separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Change in body weight was calculated as the difference between M0 and M12 (M12 − M0). For the primary ITT analysis, the population was defined as all randomized participants who obtained the required ≥5% weight loss at M2. For the ITT analysis, missing data (that is, body weight at M12) were imputed as the last observation carried forward. The analysis of differences between the groups was conducted using an ANCOVA linear mixed model, with individual change in body weight as the response, and intervention group, baseline body weight, age, sex and site as fixed effects. Additionally, a complete-case analysis (all dropouts omitted) and a per-protocol analysis (only compliant participants defined by the point scoring system) were analysed with the same ANCOVA model. Finally, adult body weight was analysed with the inclusion of all visits (time points) as a linear mixed-effect model with repeated measurements. This analysis had body weight as the response variable and included the fixed effects time-intervention interaction, age, sex and baseline body weight. Site and participants were included as random effects. If there was a significant interaction, post hoc tests were conducted with the R extension package ‘emmeans’ to calculate the estimated marginal mean and s.e.m. at each time point for comparison of the groups. This model was also used to impute missing body weight values for post hoc ITT analyses. For secondary outcomes on continuous data, the main analysis compared the 6-month and 12-month mean changes between the treatment groups by use of the ANCOVA linear mixed model defined above, without imputation of missing values (that is, complete-case analyses). All models were graphically checked by residual plots and quantile–quantile plots to assess model assumptions, mainly the normality assumption, and when relevant, transformed (for example, by logarithm). Furthermore, Poisson regression analysis was used to analyse the predictive effect of group intervention on reported AEs and concomitant medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Microbiota analysis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete microbiota data processing and analysis pipeline is available at &lt;a href="https://github.com/AlexanderUm/SWEET_microbiome"&gt;https://github.com/AlexanderUm/SWEET_microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.

Not exactly—and here’s the step count we should actually be aiming for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="japanese walking concept art" data-src="https://www.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/japanese-walking-featured-image-med-line.png" data-loaded="true" fetchpriority="high" loading="eager" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/japanese-walking-featured-image-med-line.png?auto=webp&amp;amp;width=3840&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/japanese-walking-featured-image-med-line.png?auto=webp&amp;amp;width=3840&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;p class="py-tight text-left font-utility text-utility3-size leading-utility3-line-height text-text-secondary"&gt; (Photo: Fitness watch on hand: simplehappyart/Getty; Design: Ayana Underwood/Canva)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-base-loose flex flex-wrap gap-(--spacing-base)"&gt;&lt;template id="B:0"&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pub-date font-utility-2 text-text-secondary"&gt;Published October 7, 2025 03:00AM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, in 2020, during the pandemic, I started exercising in the only space I had: my living room. No gyms. No studios. Just a yoga mat and free YouTube workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a year, I lost 100 pounds—weight I’d carried most of my life. The change is the result of a gradual layering of habits—first a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/nutrition/high-protein-tiktok-recipes/"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt; diet, then online workouts, followed by walking and running, and eventually intermittent fasting. But the real transformation wasn’t just physical. Somewhere along the way, I built something harder to measure: a healing relationship with movement. For the first time, exercise wasn’t about shrinking. I was expanding into myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I took that newfound confidence outside. I dreamed of being one of those amateur runners crossing the Boston Marathon finish line while the city collectively thawed from another long, gray winter. There was just one problem: I hated running. The poignant burn of shin splints. The sharp gasps for air. The way my lungs felt like they were being folded into origami. It was clear that no matter how badly I wanted to become a runner, my body wasn’t on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But walking? Walking was having a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/wellness/walking-popularity-comeback-coronavirus"&gt;cultural moment&lt;/a&gt;—digital creator &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.instagram.com/mia__lind/?hl=en"&gt;Mia Lind&lt;/a&gt; was actively promoting her now-famous &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://hotgirlwalk.com/pages/our-story"&gt;Hot Girl Walk&lt;/a&gt;—and I was more than ready to hop on that bandwagon. I bought ankle weights (these &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener nofollow" data-afl-p="1" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ankle-Weights-Set-0-5lb-Cuffs/dp/B013HJOYPM?tag=outsideonlinedotcom-20"&gt;two-pound weights&lt;/a&gt; are my favorite), mapped out a 2.5-mile loop, and walked every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think of walking as a consolation prize—the thing you did when you couldn’t run. I couldn’t imagine going from an 8:10 pace to genuinely enjoying what felt like a 24-minute mile—the kind of slow movement where my Apple Watch buzzes to ask me if I’ve stopped moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to May of this year, and a new walking trend has captured our attention: Japanese walking. In a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKLIdteTrQA/"&gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt;, fitness coach Eugene Teo explains this method of interval-style walking, which involves alternating between walking fast for three minutes and walking slow for three minutes, for five sets in half an hour. The goal? Metabolic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to believe walking only counted if I hit 10,000 steps a day. But over the past few years, as walking has shifted from a cooldown to the centerpiece of the wellness conversation, I’ve realized that isn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;10,000 Steps a Day—the Rule We Didn’t Question&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I ever mapped out my walking loop, I thought 10,000 steps was a rule. Not a suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lived everywhere: embedded in my fitness tracker, baked into my phone’s health app, echoed in friends’ attempts to “close their rings.” It felt like the adult version of eating your vegetables. You just did it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s what no one tells you. Ten thousand steps didn’t come from science. It came from a pedometer ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-1960s Japan, amid a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.olympics.com/ioc/news/increased-focus-on-sport-benefits-for-public-health"&gt;national fitness push&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, exercise physiologist Yoshiro Hatano estimated that doubling the average person’s daily steps—from about 4,000 to 10,000—“&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200434010-00001"&gt;would result in an increased energy expenditure of about 300 kcal/day.&lt;/a&gt;” There were no clinical trials. No test subjects. Just back-of-the-envelope energy math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the same time, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6547157/"&gt;Yamasa&lt;/a&gt;, the company known for its delicious soy sauces, released a pedometer called the manpo-kei (万歩計)—which literally translates to “10,000 steps meter.” The number wasn’t precise. But it was motivational, and so it stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2718269" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2718269" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/manpo-meter.png?width=730" alt="manpo meter japanese walking" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/manpo-meter.png?width=300 300w, https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/manpo-meter.png?width=768 768w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="pom-caption"&gt;(&lt;strong&gt;Left&lt;/strong&gt;: Vintage advertisement for the Manpo‑Meter pedometer (English Translation: “Let’s walk 10,000 steps a day”), featured in Japanese media during the mid-1960s.

&lt;p&gt;In the 2015 book &lt;span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener nofollow" data-afl-p="1" href="https://www.amazon.com/Health-Trackers-Technology-Helping-Monitor/dp/144225355X?tag=outsideonlinedotcom-20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Health Trackers: How Technology Is Helping Us Monitor and Improve Our Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, technology journalist Richard MacManus describes how Japanese companies, such as Coca-Cola Japan and the green tea brand Ito En,&lt;/span&gt; distributed pedometers as part of large-scale marketing campaigns. These giveaways weren’t just promotions; they reinforced 10,000 steps per day as a public health guideline, embedding it into daily routines and branding it as common sense. What began as a marketing device was quietly becoming a cultural standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That foundation set the stage for one of Silicon Valley’s most iconic inventions—the FitBit. When Fitbit launched in 2009, it put 10,000 steps as the default daily goal—not because medical science required it, but because decades of repetition had already made it &lt;i&gt;feel&lt;/i&gt; official. Fitbit’s own Help Center confirms: “The &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14236510?hl=en&amp;amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com#zippy=%2Cwhich-core-stats-does-my-fitbit-device-track-automatically%2Ccan-i-change-my-activity-goal-on-my-fitbit-device"&gt;default daily step goal&lt;/a&gt; is 10,000 steps.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other wearables—like those from Apple, Garmin, and Samsung—gave steps prominent placement, even when their dashboards focused more on metrics like calories burned or active minutes. By then, steps had become the clearest, most shareable proof of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Quiet Resistance Embedded in Japanese Walking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10,000-step rule didn’t begin as a mandate; it started as a story—a round number, wrapped in optimism. Like most stories, it’s worth asking, &lt;em&gt;What happens when you stop believing it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That question is what led me to try Japanese Interval Walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it appears to be just another niche trend. But the more I read, the more it felt like quiet resistance—a method grounded in rhythm, not accumulation—a counterpoint to Western fitness culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Benefits of Japanese Walking, According to Science&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, exercise physiologist Dr. Hiroshi Nose and his team at Shinshu University in Japan developed Interval Walking Training (IWT), a deceptively simple yet highly effective protocol specifically designed for aging populations. Walk fast, then slow, three minutes each, five times per walking session, at least four days each week. No wearables. No tracking apps required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/148769277?utm_source=linkout"&gt;five-month randomized controlled trial&lt;/a&gt; involving 246 older adults, IWT outperformed moderate-intensity continuous walking and sedentary control groups. Participants in the IWT group experienced a ten percent increase in peak aerobic capacity (&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/vo2-max-brain/"&gt;VO₂ max&lt;/a&gt;), as well as a 13- and 17-percent increase in quadriceps and hamstring strength, respectively. A reduction in systolic blood pressure was another benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0285762"&gt;Broader reviews&lt;/a&gt; associate IWT with significant gains in fitness, muscle strength, and glycemic stability in individuals with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Japanese Walking Focuses on Effort, Not Step Count&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What surprises me most is how differently IWT frames the idea of progress. It’s not about pushing harder, going longer, or obsessing over streaks. Instead, IWT asks for attention, not intensity; presence, not performance. You don’t need to post your workout stats or chase medals. You just need to show up, breathe a little harder, and let your body remember how to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not about what you can post—but how you feel when you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That philosophy sits in sharp contrast to step-count culture, where success is visible, measurable, and shareable, where the end goal is often less about how your body feels and more about whether your tracker vibrates in approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, IWT isn’t a magic bullet. The Shinshu University training method focused on a fairly specific group—healthy, older Japanese adults—which makes it harder to say how the protocol translates across more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the encouraging part, per the Shinsu study: even when participants didn’t hit every target, they still saw meaningful gains in blood pressure, aerobic capacity, and strength. In other words, you don’t have to be perfect for IWT to work—you just have to show up often enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a culture that equates health with hustle, that quiet efficiency is the most radical act of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But structure isn’t the only way intention can take shape. While some walks are designed for blood pressure management, others are curated for presence and joy. If IWT is a quiet rebellion against numbers, the Hot Girl Walk is a bold reimagination—and both challenge what progress is supposed to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Many Steps Should You Walk Every Day?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because walking stopped being something you &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; and evolved into something you tracked, shared, and proved, step count signaled effort, discipline, even virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, the number was never required. It turns out that you don’t need 10,000 steps to be healthy. Not even close, in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2020 study in &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31141585/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that for older women, health benefits began to appear around 4,400 steps and plateaued at 7,500 steps. A &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-primary underline hover:text-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35247352/"&gt;2022 &lt;i&gt;Lancet&lt;/i&gt; meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt; found that 6,000 to 8,000 steps were adequate for most older adults, with younger adults typically plateauing closer to the 10,000-step count.

&lt;p&gt;So why does the 10,000-step rule endure? Because it feels complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral psychologists refer to this phenomenon as the “round number effect”—our instinctive attraction to clean, whole figures. Buzzes, badges, and streaks turned it into more than a goal. It became proof of doing wellness right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when the number becomes the focus, quality is often lost. A leisurely 10,000-step stroll might do less for your heart than 4,000 brisk ones—but your app rewards both the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I walked, the more I realized the act itself is simple—but the meaning we attach to it rarely is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, walking offers structure. A measured, repeatable ritual. For others, it’s a mood, an aesthetic, a way to step into confidence. And for many, it’s just a number—a goal preloaded into a wristband, quietly urging us to try harder. Each of these approaches reflects not just a style of movement, but a worldview. A belief about what counts. What’s worth tracking? What progress looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These paths don’t compete so much as coexist. But they do ask different things of us. Some ask for precision. Others, presence. Others still, proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the meaning of walking didn’t arrive all at once. It unfolded slowly—on cold mornings, on sidewalks slick with slush, through half-smiles exchanged with strangers I’d never know by name. In moments when no one was watching, and I wasn’t performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What started for me as a 2.5-mile loop with ankle weights and a podcast became a daily invitation: to listen to my body. To loosen my grip on old goals. To move for the sake of moving, not for the data I could collect or the image I could project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That shift didn’t erase ambition or discipline—it redefined them. It reminded me that movement doesn’t have to equate to an arbitrary round number to be meaningful. It doesn’t need to be validated by a graph or broadcast in an Instagram caption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the most radical thing you can do is move without trying to make it count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-education-nutrition-medical-training-reforms.html"&gt;recently demanded&lt;/a&gt; that medical schools teach nutrition, and that the organizations in charge of medical education standards had two weeks to come up with plans to teach it, and include it in licensing exams and residency requirements.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two local medical schools say they’re ready — because they have included nutrition as part of their curricula for years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drexel University’s nutrition curriculum dates back to the late 1990s, said &lt;a href="https://drexel.edu/medicine/faculty/profiles/michael-white/"&gt;Michael White&lt;/a&gt;, professor emeritus of pharmacology and physiology at the Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia. Medical students spend around 20 hours of class time learning about topics like vitamins, food labels, and how to assess a patient’s energy and nutrition needs to have proper food for them during hospital stays.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given how much nutrition we already cover, we don’t have much to worry about with that declaration from HHS and the Department of Education,” he said.
  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He added that the medical school faculty at Drexel considers nutrition to be an important part of health, which is why the program has had it as part of its curriculum for so many years.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper Medical School at Rowan University in New Jersey not only teaches nutrition across various courses, the school also has research projects and community service projects focused on nutrition, said &lt;a href="https://cmsru.rowan.edu/about/leadership-team/sangita-phadtare.html"&gt;Sangita Phadtare&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant dean and professor of biomedical sciences at the university.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, students participate in a local community garden to grow fresh vegetables, and they also worked with a local community group to explain to Spanish-speaking residents how to interpret food labels, and how diabetes patients can build healthy meals from dollar-store foods like dried beans and frozen vegetables, if they don’t have cars.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a school, we try to do our part because we believe that Camden is our home. It’s not just our workplace,” Phadtare said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though I would say that we fare well, there is always scope for doing more,” she added. “We personally, as a medical education community, think that nutrition in medical education is important. And even without anybody telling us that, we should be doing that.”

Fewer than 2% of them had ever discussed menopause with their dentist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;And at her most recent appointment? Her own dentist was reluctant to talk to her about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The board got through their first five minutes of being surprised and ‘Are we really talking about this?’ and then something amazing happened,” she says. “They had science and information about menopause to connect with their wives and daughters in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Chavarria doesn’t shy away from sharing her own menopause stories – whether with her board or her 5,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“You can’t ignore it when half of the population is going to go through menopause,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even with &lt;a href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/menopause-penalty" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;more women 55&lt;/a&gt; and older in the workforce than ever before, women often are afraid to talk about menopause in the office. They fear disclosing brain fog will make them appear less competent, that talking with younger or male coworkers who may not understand menopause will lead to discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;While employer support is still low, &lt;a href="https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/benefits-compensation/number-of-employers-offering-menopause-benefits-increases-only-n" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;fewer than 5% offer meaningful programs&lt;/a&gt;, more companies are adding improved coverage for hormone therapy, paid time off and even regulating the office thermostat. This summer &lt;a href="https://rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/15/ril.pressrelease.inputform/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&amp;amp;ID=375783" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; became the first state to mandate that companies offer accommodations menopause symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;With one in 10 women leaving the workforce due to menopause, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/inclusion-diversity/viewpoint-understanding-the-impact-of-menopause-in-the-workplace" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Society for Human Resource Management&lt;/a&gt;, and another one in five considering retiring early, researchers say it’s become the &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w0ZVZQyHos6gNkGlGwdmJP55no94O3Y0/view" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;menopause penalty.&lt;/a&gt; It can lead to fewer women leaders at a time when they make up fewer than &lt;a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2024/10/18/gender-diversity-in-the-c-suite-womens-representation-in-the-2024-sp-100/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;one-third of the spots.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Chavarria, who introduced &lt;a href="https://www1.deltadentalins.com/newsroom/releases/2025/09/women-want-menopause-specific-dental-benefits.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Delta Dental’s first menopause report&lt;/a&gt; three years ago, says policies such as remote work can help. But what’s most important is that women see a health care provider, that practitioners from dentists to primary care doctors know how to help, and that the treatment is covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Sharing my own story can encourage others to talk about menopause at work, to get help or see their doctor,” she says. “But first we need to be OK talking about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;When quitting feels like the only option&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For Khris Rogers, the symptoms that consumed her during perimenopause stole her ability to keep her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Her periods became so heavy that her 90-minute commute as an office manager in Southern California became impossible without a break. She had joint pain and frozen shoulder, hot flashes that interrupted her sleep. Her patience felt shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Everything just became harder,” Rogers, 52, says. “I had to be realistic. I just couldn’t deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/citation/2025/04000/menopause_in_the_workplace__does_physical_activity.3.aspx" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Menopause&lt;/a&gt; and perimenopause can result in more &lt;a href="https://wearemorphus.com/blogs/press-releases/new-research-from-morphus-reveals-over-103-symptoms-of-perimenopause-and-menopause-it-s-time-to-break-the-silence?srsltid=AfmBOooNA0zq_jmJTHgJD5GhdiWis6Ovllp7HcN-pL-M29cga-vNwptn" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;than 103 symptoms&lt;/a&gt; ranging from fatigue to severe tooth decay and brain fog that leave women missing more days of work, diminished productivity and reduced earning potential.

When they presented their road map to the NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya last week, he praised it for addressing a top priority: rebuilding public trust in clinical research. Which made it all the more confusing to the assembled panelists that this meeting would be their last.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The advisory committee, NExTRAC, was established in 2019 to take over the work of a storied panel, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC. Starting in the mid-’70s, as the first genetic engineering technologies were being developed, RAC oversaw the rollout of synthetic insulin and the earliest days of gene therapy’s rocky entrance into clinical testing, laying much of the groundwork for &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/31/gene-therapy-crisis-rare-disease-car-t/"&gt;its modern-day success&lt;/a&gt;. Newer biosafety and ethical quagmires, like &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2015/11/17/gene-drive-hijack-evolution/"&gt;CRISPR gene drives&lt;/a&gt; and novel uses of personal health data, have been the purview of NExTRAC over the past five years. But in May, members received emails from Bhattacharya notifying them that the committee was being sunset as part of an effort to make the NIH run more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now it’s unclear how, or if, the NIH will foster open conversations around scientific and ethical issues involving novel biotechnologies. The loss of NExTRAC is part of a pattern of shedding scientific expertise and patient perspectives in the name of slimming down the federal government. Since January, President Trump’s administration has terminated nearly four dozen committees that provide advice to various agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, according to a federal database.&lt;/p&gt;

This is especially true for Long COVID, a chronic condition that can develop after COVID-19 that causes a variety of lasting symptoms. Among the most common and debilitating of these is cognitive impairment, often referred to as "brain fog," which affects over 80% of people with Long COVID. Given the hundreds of millions of global cases, Long COVID represents a massive public health and socioeconomic challenge, as it severely impacts people's ability to work and perform daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, despite its prevalence, the underlying causes of Long COVID and brain fog remain poorly understood. Previous imaging studies have shown some structural changes in the brain, but they could not pinpoint the molecular dysfunctions responsible for the cognitive symptoms. Since it's difficult to observe the molecules that govern communication between brain cells directly, researchers are left without objective biomarkers to confirm a Long COVID diagnosis or develop therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, a research team led by Professor Takuya Takahashi from the Graduate School of Medicine at Yokohama City University, Japan, has made a significant breakthrough in understanding the cause of Long COVID brain fog. As explained in their paper, published in &lt;em&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; on October 1, 2025, the team hypothesized that patients with brain fog might exhibit disrupted expression of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) -- key molecules for memory and learning -- based on prior research into psychiatric and neurological disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and dementia. Thus, they used a novel method called [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]K-2 AMPAR PET imaging to directly visualize and quantify the density of AMPARs in the living human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By comparing imaging data from 30 patients with Long COVID to 80 healthy individuals, the researchers found a notable and widespread increase in the density of AMPARs across the brains of patients. This elevated receptor density was directly correlated with the severity of their cognitive impairment, suggesting a clear link between these molecular changes and the symptoms. Additionally, the concentrations of various inflammatory markers were also correlated with AMPAR levels, indicating a possible interaction between inflammation and receptor expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study's findings represent a crucial step forward in addressing many unresolved issues regarding Long COVID. The systemic increase in AMPARs provides a direct biological explanation for the cognitive symptoms, highlighting a target for potential treatments. For example, drugs that suppress AMPAR activity could be a viable approach to mitigate brain fog. Interestingly, the team's analysis also demonstrated that imaging data can be used to distinguish patients from healthy controls with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. "&lt;em&gt;By applying our newly developed AMPA receptor PET imaging technology, we aim to provide a novel perspective and innovative solutions to the pressing medical challenge that is Long COVID,&lt;/em&gt;" remarks Prof. Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While further efforts will be needed to find a definitive solution for Long COVID, this work is a promising step in the right direction. "&lt;em&gt;Our findings clearly demonstrate that Long COVID brain fog should be recognized as a legitimate clinical condition. This could encourage the healthcare industry to accelerate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for this disorder&lt;/em&gt;," concludes Prof. Takahashi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, the team's findings resolve key uncertainties about the biological basis of Long COVID brain fog and may pave the way for novel diagnostic tools and effective therapies for patients suffering from this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clinical trial project was supported by donations from the READYFOR crowdfunding platform. This project was partially supported by Takeda Science Foundation (T.T.), the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) under grant numbers JP24wm0625304 (T.T.), and JST through the Establishment of University Fellowships Towards the Creation of Science Technology Innovation program, under grant JPMJFS2140 (Y.F.).&lt;/p&gt;
