                &lt;p&gt;For about a year, Mariana wasn't sure what to make of her bloating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, she assumed it was just part of being a woman with a regular menstrual cycle. She also had some friends with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, thinking she had similar GI issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in April, she noticed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rectal-bleeding-most-common-early-sign-of-colon-cancer-taboo-2025-5" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;blood in her stool&lt;/a&gt; — one of the most common symptoms of colon cancer in young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That alarmed me a little bit," Tata, 26, told Business Insider. When it didn't go away for a month, she called her primary care physician, who believed the cause was hemorrhoids but sent Tata to get an abdominal scan just in case, as she was also diagnosed with anemia a few years before and suddenly had worsened symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scan revealed a 20-centimeter tumor on one of her ovaries. Tata was sent to Syracuse Hospital in New York, where more testing led to a stage 4 &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-so-many-young-people-getting-colon-cancer-answer-infancy-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;, with the cancer spreading to her abdominal wall. Shortly after, both of her ovaries and fallopian tubes would be removed, Tata losing her ability to have biological children.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tata, still in treatment, remembers being shocked.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"When you're young, you don't think that it's cancer," she said. "Colon cancer was not in my mind at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="22b62653-8245-42ce-b6df-6cae53718c63" data-toc-id="22b62653-8245-42ce-b6df-6cae53718c63"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer changed her life plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Prior to her diagnosis, Tata planned to buy a house and have kids with her boyfriend.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Prior to her diagnosis, Tata and her boyfriend discussed their future: Having kids and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/true-cost-young-colon-cancer-crisis-2025-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;buying a house together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans changed when she needed surgery to remove the large mass on her right ovary, which she soon learned damaged her left ovary as well. "There was no option to save any of my eggs," Tata said, meaning she would have to carry &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-cancer-fertility-preservation-egg-sperm-freezing-state-laws-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;donated eggs or embryos&lt;/a&gt; through IVF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Tata said, that means she's letting go of the idea of having children. Knowing she'd have to pay for cancer treatment also made her rethink other plans, like&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she hit her deductible, she was "scraping together" as much as she could to pay for the ER visits, CT scan, abdominal scan, and blood work. While she said some friends helped put together a GoFundMe to help with costs, she's still paying off a hospital bill from the summer that cost nearly $1,000, and anticipates &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-true-hidden-cost-price-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;future treatment costs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very rough, especially in your 20s and 30s when you plan on using your money for something else and then you get hit with cancer," she said. "You have to reevaluate what you're actually spending your money on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5e3e66b5-b44b-484e-a2fd-4c66024b3d6a" data-toc-id="5e3e66b5-b44b-484e-a2fd-4c66024b3d6a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Splitting time between her boyfriend and parents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Tata splits her time between two homes, based on her &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/young-cervical-cancer-diagnosis-marriage-motherhood-finances-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;chemotherapy schedule&lt;/a&gt;. On the night before her next treatment, she leaves the apartment she shares with her boyfriend to go to her parents' house. Because her boyfriend works and her parents are retired, she can get more around-the-clock care there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My mom is the one who nurses me back to health, basically," Tata said, giving her anti-nausea medication around the clock. "My family has been absolutely amazing, and I think my being so strong comes from them because they carry me whenever I can't do it anymore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tata, who had parts of her colon removed prior to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-cancer-innovations-asco-2025-exercise-as-drug-astra-zeneca-early-treatment-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;starting chemotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, feels she bounces back better from treatments than &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;other cancer patients&lt;/a&gt; she's spoken to. On the alternating weeks that she doesn't have chemotherapy, she said she almost forgets she has cancer, focusing more on getting her strength back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the days when she gets disconnected from her chemo pump are brutal, usually lasting from Wednesday to Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It kind of punches you in the face and reminds you every two weeks that you have to go through this and you are sick," she said. "It's kind of just my new reality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="46baf615-d450-484f-afe1-b5148aa1e846" data-toc-id="46baf615-d450-484f-afe1-b5148aa1e846"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making sense of her diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;As of now, Tata is considered stable, with no progression of cancer as she continues chemotherapy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My oncologist expects me to go back to work in February, which is very nice," she said. Tata, who is still employed as an enrollment operations assistant at her alma mater, Utica University, went on short-term and long-term disability during treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's hoping her treatments become more scattered after chemotherapy, helping her to more closely return to the routine she had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/identical-twins-young-colon-cancer-diagnosis-2025-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;before her diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said connecting with other colon cancer patients through the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://colorectalcancer.org/" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and a Facebook group helped her get more comfortable with sharing her experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the beginning of my diagnosis, I didn't know what to do with myself," she said. "I felt so alone, and I wasn't ready to talk to people." Connecting with others made it easier to deal with her ongoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="10fc57cb-2834-484d-85a9-0d9714976d2e" data-toc-id="10fc57cb-2834-484d-85a9-0d9714976d2e"&gt;Her advice: Get a second opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also made her more aware of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-colon-cancer-on-the-rise-reasons-why-2024-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;rising rates of cancer&lt;/a&gt; among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I feel like young people are the margin of the forgotten who do face this," she said. Given how subtle colon cancer symptoms can be, she hopes other young people take action if they sense a change in their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Go to the doctor, no matter how big or small it is," she said. "Because what I thought was a small thing turned into a very big thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also emphasized advocating for yourself and even seeking out &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;second opinions&lt;/a&gt;, because "not a lot of doctors jump when you notice bleeding in your stool." In her case, she's grateful that hers took immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If my doctor didn't recommend a CT scan or abdominal scan, I don't know where I would be right now," she said.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;If you feel a lift after exercise, you're in good company. Movement can boost mood, and according to the results of a new study, it can also help relieve symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As part of a &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7/full" target="_blank"&gt;review of evidence &lt;/a&gt;by the Cochrane collaboration — an independent network of researchers — scientists evaluated 73 randomized controlled trials that included about 5,000 people with depression, many of whom also tried antidepressant medication.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"We found that exercise was as effective as pharmacological treatments or psychological therapies as well," says &lt;a href="https://arc-nwc.nihr.ac.uk/team/andrew-clegg/" target="_blank"&gt;Andrew Clegg&lt;/a&gt;, a professor at the University of Lancashire in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The findings are not a surprise to psychiatrist &lt;a href="https://providers.inspirahealthnetwork.org/provider/stephen-mateka/1590056" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Stephen Mateka&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of psychiatry at Inspira Health. "This new Cochrane review reinforces the evidence that exercise is one of the most evidence-based tools for improving mood," says Mateka.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He explains how it mirrors some of the effects of medication. "Exercise can help improve neurotransmitter function, like serotonin as well as dopamine and endorphins. So there is certainly overlap between exercise and how antidepressants offer relief," Mateka says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In other words, exercise helps release chemicals in the body that are known to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/19/1200223456/depression-anxiety-prevention-mental-health-healthy-habits" target="_blank"&gt;boost mood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;And there's another powerful effect too. Exercise can trigger the release of brain growth factors, explains &lt;a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-medicine/news-all/psychiatry-resident-dr-nicholas-fabiano-profiled-rising-star-new-neuroscience-journal" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nicholas Fabiano&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Ottawa. He says depression can decrease neuroplasticity, making it harder for the brain to adapt and change.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The brain in depression is thought to be less plastic. So there's less what we call neurotrophic factors, or BDNF," Fabiano explains. He calls it the Miracle-Gro for the brain. "And we know that exercise can also boost it. So I think exercise is a fundamental pillar we really need to counsel patients on," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while medications and therapy are important tools, Fabiano says exercise is recognized as a preferred &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10225323/#:~:text=The%20National%20Institute%20for%20Health,prevention%20and%20treatment%20of%20depression." target="_blank"&gt;treatment for depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Exercise has been adopted as a &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/20/1388.abstract" target="_blank"&gt;first-line treatment&lt;/a&gt; in guidelines for depression globally with good acceptability and safety," he writes. Yet he says it remains underappreciated and underutilized.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's much easier for a primary care physician to prescribe medication to a patient. You just write it on a pad," Fabiano says. It's harder to prescribe exercise, which takes time and effort and can be difficult to start for people who are depressed. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Fabiano says exercise can work best as part of a combination of treatments. "We can start someone on an antidepressant — maybe that improves their mood, and they're able to engage in therapy. And from there, maybe now they're more interested in starting some of these lifestyle habits like exercise," Fabiano says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;How much exercise is enough?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The evidence shows light to moderate exercise — where you get your heart rate up enough to feel slightly winded — can be as beneficial as vigorous or intense exercise, at least early on. And Fabiano says it's OK to start with a "low dose."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Ultimately you want to work your way up. But going from completely sedentary to even just going for a walk every day, that's where you start seeing those exponential gains," he says, stressing the importance of getting started with modest amounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study found that a combination of aerobic exercise and resistance training appears to be more effective than aerobic alone. The meta-analysis found between 13 and 36 workouts led to improvements in depressive symptoms, though long-term follow-up was rare. Researchers say there's more to learn about how regular exercise may help stave off depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mateka says there are lots of options. "When it comes to exercise, it's about just finding the exercise that works for you, such as something like yoga or tai chi versus something like walking and jogging," he says. For some, group activity can add to the psychosocial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it's best to pick something you enjoy or go back to an activity or &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/14/nx-s1-5434386/social-prescription-arts-exercise-loneliness" target="_blank"&gt;sport you liked as a child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Exercise is something that is extremely low cost. It's very accessible. It has very minimal side effects. And it has the opportunity to impact you positively, mentally, emotionally, socially and physically," Mateka says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxPekM0YlR5b0ZTNGlqaUNZM2JlODdBNHNic0ZYbVc4cE1BbVpRUG1USkJiUmJnZ01sVVE3WHA5dnI1REMxMnRVdEdrd0JWc1hBeGdmYTltOTJhQU1WS3JnSUJDSFo2VTN2bTNCNUtOXzJOTVdSYjIyX2EtLWhrcFlsZEs0MGtwUGxTLTlzaUY2a01NNVA4SVFzV0poUnhES0ptbDVBSXh0MFExdkR2RzJYaFU3X1ZiZXE0Y3c</guid></item><item><title>一种鲜为人知的健康综合症可能会影响几乎所有人- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260112001001.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;A large majority of U.S. adults are unfamiliar with cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, even though it affects nearly 90% of adults nationwide. CKM syndrome is a recently defined condition that brings together several major health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and obesity. According to a new survey from the American Heart Association, many people have not heard of CKM syndrome, yet most say they want to better understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor linked to CKM syndrome.&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; These risk factors include high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, high blood glucose (sugar), excess weight and reduced kidney function. When these issues occur together, they raise the risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure far more than any single condition on its own. For many people, CKM syndrome can be reversed through changes in eating habits, physical activity and appropriate medical treatment.&lt;sup&gt;[2,3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We want people to know that it's really common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time. It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more," said Eduardo Sanchez, M.D., FAHA, the American Heart Association's chief medical officer for prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Heart Kidneys and Metabolism Are Connected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CKM health refers to the combined function of the heart, kidneys and metabolic system (responsible for creating, using and storing energy, which affects weight and blood glucose level). These systems rely on one another to work properly. If one begins to struggle, it can place added strain on the others. Over time, this interaction can create a harmful cycle that significantly increases the risk of developing CKM syndrome. The American Heart Association plans to release the first-ever clinical guidelines focused on CKM syndrome in early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the Survey Revealed About Public Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new survey highlights major gaps in understanding about CKM health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Only 12% of U.S. adults said they had heard of CKM health or CKM syndrome&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;79% agreed it is important to learn more about CKM health, and 72% said they want additional information&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Most respondents were interested in how CKM syndrome is treated (72%) and diagnosed (71%)&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;68% incorrectly believed health conditions should be managed one at a time or were unsure of the best approach&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;42% thought a healthy heart would not likely be affected by other organ systems or were uncertain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The heart, kidney and metabolic systems are connected and, as such, should be treated in a coordinated way," Sanchez said. "These results reveal the need to emphasize those connections and help patients understand the importance of collaborative care."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helping People Take Action Earlier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through its CKM Health Initiative, the American Heart Association is offering educational tools and an online resource hub to explain how heart, kidney and metabolic health are linked. These resources aim to help people take early steps to lower their risk of heart attack, heart failure or stroke. The Association is also working with healthcare teams nationwide to strengthen collaboration among professionals caring for patients with multiple chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Simple Way to Understand CKM Health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new educational video explains "2 truths" about heart health using clear visuals and plain language (watch the video here):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The heart pumps blood to the body&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The metabolic system turns glucose (sugar) from the blood into energy&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The process of metabolism dumps waste back into the blood&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;The kidneys filter waste from the blood and balance fluids, which helps with blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Blood pressure affects how the heart pumps blood into the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CKM health is about your overall health," said Sanchez. "It's a full circle. You can take care of your overall health with regular checks of your blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, blood sugar and kidney function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Survey Was Conducted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Harris Poll carried out the survey in August 2025 on behalf of the American Heart Association to measure public awareness of CKM syndrome and CKM health. Approximately 4,000 U.S. adults participated. Health care professionals can find additional resources on interdisciplinary care and learn how to join the CKM Health Initiative at &lt;a href="http://heart.org/CKMtools"&gt;heart.org/CKMtools&lt;/a&gt;. The American Heart Association's Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic Health Initiative is supported by Founding Sponsors Novo Nordisk® and Boehringer Ingelheim, Supporting Sponsors Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Bayer, and Champion Sponsor DaVita®.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted online in the United States by The Harris Poll on behalf of the American Heart Association among 4,007 US adults aged 18+. The survey was conducted 8/6 -- 8/22/2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data were weighted by education, age by gender, race/ethnicity, region, household income, household size, marital status, employment and smoking status to reflect population proportions. Respondents were selected from individuals who agreed to participate in surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sampling precision for Harris online polls is measured using a Bayesian credible interval. For this study, results are accurate within ± 2.0 percentage points at a 95% confidence level. Precision varies across subgroups. As with all surveys, additional sources of error may exist, including nonresponse, question wording and post-survey adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

My colleagues and I have conducted research that suggests you can, and often sooner than you might expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether in a quick text message, a long email, a casual chat with a friend, or a comment online, the words people choose quietly reveal deeper patterns in how they think, feel, and relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has personality traits – habitual ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. When these patterns become rigid, intense or disruptive, they can cause ongoing problems with emotions, sense of self and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the more severe end are personality disorders, where these patterns create significant distress and impairment. Common &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/people-with-personality-disorders-are-more-likely-to-sign-up-for-psychology-studies-heres-why-thats-a-problem-201237"&gt;personality disorders&lt;/a&gt; include narcissistic, antisocial, and borderline personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But not everybody has a full-blown disorder. Personality functioning actually exists on a spectrum. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-are-we-becoming-so-narcissistic-heres-the-science-55773"&gt;We’re all a little narcissistic&lt;/a&gt;, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people you meet – at work, when dating, or online – may show milder difficulties, such as mood fluctuations, negativity, rigid thinking or darker traits like manipulation and callousness. These patterns often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145041"&gt;slip into how people speak&lt;/a&gt; or write long before they show up in more explicit behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noticing these patterns can help us learn about and understand others, support those who may be struggling, and navigate our social lives safely – online and offline – with greater awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some extreme examples. Linguists &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/forensicsci3010006"&gt;analysing the personal letters of Austrian serial killer Jack Unterweger&lt;/a&gt; – widely viewed as a classic case of malignant narcissism – found unusually high levels of self-focused language, such as “I” and “me”. He also had a notably flat emotional tone. Likewise, letters from Dennis Rader, the BTK killer (bind, torture, kill) displayed strikingly &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/C/bo44312033.html"&gt;grandiose, detached and dominance-focused wording.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have long known that certain linguistic habits reveal how people are functioning internally. For example, people experiencing distress consistently use more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2017.02.005"&gt;self-focused language&lt;/a&gt; and more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.05.035"&gt;negative emotion words&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because they internalise a lot and experience negative affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with darker personality traits often use more &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2983323.2983822"&gt;hostile, negative and disconnected language&lt;/a&gt;, including more swear words and anger words, such as “hate” or “mad”. At the same time, they use fewer socially connected terms like “we”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitally, these patterns aren’t usually deliberate. They emerge naturally because &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X09351676"&gt;language tracks attention, emotion and thought&lt;/a&gt;. With computational text analysis, researchers can now analyse these subtle cues at scale, and rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our research findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across four studies using computational text analysis – three of which formed my &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.17635/lancaster/thesis/2215"&gt;PhD research&lt;/a&gt; – my colleagues and I found clear evidence that personality dysfunction leaves a detectable trace in everyday communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one study of 530 people, published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1521/pedi.2023.37.4.444"&gt;Journal of Personality Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed written essays about peoples’ close relationships. We also collected data on their levels of personality dysfunction. Those with greater personality dysfunction used language that carried a sense of urgency and self-focus – “I need…”, “I have to…”, “I am…”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was expressed alongside ruminative, past-tense wording. They also had more negative, particularly angry, emotion terms, such as “furious” and “annoyed”. At the same time, they used noticeably less intimate or affiliative language such as “we”, “love” and “family”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second project, published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2023.100647"&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders Reports&lt;/a&gt;, we again analysed written essays (530 people), as well as transcribed conversations from 64 romantic couples which included women with diagnosed personality disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across both written and spoken communication, those with more dysfunctional or disordered personalities used more negative emotion words – and a wider variety of them. Even during mundane conversations, their language carried heavier negative affect, indicating a preoccupation with negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to online communication, in a study recently published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44184-025-00142-w"&gt;npj Mental Health Research&lt;/a&gt;, we analysed nearly 67,000 Reddit posts from 992 people who self-identified as having a personality disorder. Those who frequently engaged in self-harm used language that was markedly more negative and constricted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their posts contained more self-focused language and more negations – such as “can’t”. They also used more sadness and anger terms, and more swearing, while referencing other people less. Their wording was also more absolutist, reflecting all-or-nothing thinking, favouring words like “always”, “never”, or “completely”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these features created a linguistic picture of emotional overwhelm, negativity, withdrawal and rigid thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in an ongoing project analysing more than 830,000 posts from the same 992 individuals with personality disorder, plus 1.3 million posts from a general-population comparison group of 945 people, we examined how people express their self-beliefs (“I am …”, “I feel …”, “My …”). Using an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2025.acl-long.69"&gt;advanced self-belief classification tool&lt;/a&gt;, we found that people with personality disorders shared self-beliefs on online discussion forums far more often, and their wording differed profoundly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their self-beliefs were more negative, extreme, and disorder-focused, including phrases like “my mental health”, “symptoms”, “diagnosis” and “medication”. They also used more emotional descriptors such as “depressive”, “suicidal” and “panic”. Many self-belief statements centred on pain and trauma – “abusive”, “abandonment”, “hurt”, “suffer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also frequently referenced childhood or significant relationships (“mother”, “partner”, “relationship”). These patterns arose across a wide range of discussion contexts, suggesting that deeper struggles with identity may surface in language universally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding these linguistic patterns isn’t about diagnosing people from their texts. It is about noticing shifts in language that can provide gentle clues. If someone’s messages suddenly become unusually urgent or extreme, emotionally negative, absolutist, inward-focused and socially detached, it may be a sign they’re struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in everyday situations – dating, befriending, online interactions – recognising patterns of hostility, extreme negativity, and emotional and cognitive rigidity can help people spot early signs. This is particularly for dark personality styles, such as psychopathy or narcissism. For instance, noticeably high use of self-references (“I”, “me”), anger words (“hate”, “angry”), and swear words, combined with a lack of terminology indicative of social connection (“we”, “us”, “our”), may be important language patterns to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no single word or phrase reveals someone’s personality. People vent, joke, and use sarcasm. What really matters is the pattern over time; the emotional tone, themes and recurring linguistic habits. Subtle linguistic traces can offer a window into someone’s emotional world, identity, thinking patterns and relationships long before they speak openly about their difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

			&lt;p&gt;A UK man who is thought to be Britain's youngest dementia sufferer recently passed away from the disease at only 24 years old. Andre Yarham, from Norfolk in England, was just 22 when he was first diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the age of 24, most brains are still settling into adulthood. But Yarham's brain looked decades older – resembling the &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37828227/uks-youngest-dementia-patient-dies-brain-70-year-old/"&gt;brain of a 70-year-old&lt;/a&gt;, according to the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="188399" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; scan that helped diagnose him with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yarham initially &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/bulletin/news/youngest-dementia-andre-yarham-death-b2896596.html"&gt;began exhibiting symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of dementia in 2022, with family saying he had become increasingly forgetful and would sometimes have a blank expression on his face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-sad-case-of-the-youngest-person-ever-to-be-diagnosed-with-alzheimers"&gt;The Sad Case of The Youngest Person Ever to Be Diagnosed With Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final stages of his life, he lost his speech, could no longer care for himself, behaved "inappropriately," and was bound to his wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is usually associated with old age. However, some forms of dementia can strike astonishingly early and move frighteningly fast. Take &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms241411732"&gt;frontotemporal dementia&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. This was the &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/youngest-dementia-patient-andre-yarham-norfolk-b2896579.html"&gt;form of dementia&lt;/a&gt; that Yarham was diagnosed with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="188399" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, which tends to affect memory first, frontotemporal dementia attacks the parts of the brain involved in personality, behaviour, and language. These regions sit behind the forehead and above the ears in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/095943889390204C?via%3Dihub"&gt;frontal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3420617/"&gt;temporal&lt;/a&gt; lobes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188405" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188405" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-642x433.jpg" alt="Human brain anatomy, illustration" class="size-medium wp-image-188405" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-642x433.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Human-brain-anatomy-illustration.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188405" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of the human brain anatomy. (Science Photo Library/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These areas help us plan, control impulses, understand speech, and express ourselves. When they're damaged, people may change in ways that are deeply distressing for families – becoming withdrawn, impulsive, or unable to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia is a less common form of dementia, thought to account for around &lt;a href="https://www.dementiauk.org/wp-content/uploads/dementia-uk-understanding-frontemporal-dementia.pdf"&gt;one in 20&lt;/a&gt; cases. What makes it especially cruel is that it can appear in young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, frontotemporal dementia has a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0891988710383574"&gt;strong genetic component&lt;/a&gt;. Changes in specific genes can disrupt how brain cells handle proteins. Instead of these proteins being broken down and recycled, they clump together inside the neurons (brain cells) – interfering with their ability to function and survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, affected brain cells stop working and die. As more cells are lost, the brain tissue itself shrinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why this process can sometimes begin so early in life is still not fully understood. However, when a person has a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2016.04.004"&gt;powerful genetic mutation&lt;/a&gt;, the disease does not need decades to unfold. Instead, the mutation allows the damage to accelerate, and the brain's usual resilience fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain scans carried out while Yarham was alive showed striking shrinkage for someone so young. But to compare Yarham's brain with that of someone in their 70s would be misleading. His brain had not "aged faster" in the usual sense. Instead, large numbers of neurons had been lost in a short period of time because of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2017.00412"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;, the brain changes slowly. Certain regions become a little thinner, but the overall structure remains intact for decades. But in aggressive forms of dementia, whole brain networks collapse at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes can shrink dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As these regions deteriorate, people lose the abilities that those areas support – including speech, emotional control, and decision-making abilities. This would explain why Yarham lost language so late but so suddenly – and why his need for full-time care escalated so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brain donation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yarham's family decided to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2k9xp5je1go.amp"&gt;donate his brain to research&lt;/a&gt;. This is an extraordinary gift – one that transforms tragedy into hope for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia currently has no cure. Once symptoms begin, there's no way to stop them, and treatments that slow symptoms have limited effects. Part of the reason for this is because the brain is vastly complex and still not entirely understood. Every donated brain helps close that gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brains affected by very early dementia are exceptionally rare. Each donated brain allows scientists to study, in fine detail, what went wrong at the level of cells and proteins. Although brain scans can tell us what brain parts have been lost, only donated tissue can reveal why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can examine which proteins accumulated, which cell types were most vulnerable, and how inflammation and immune responses may have contributed to the damage. That knowledge feeds directly into efforts to develop treatments that slow, stop, or even prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family's decision to allow scientists to study tissue from such a rare, early-onset case of frontotemporal dementia could help unlock secrets that may guide treatments for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a neuroscientist, I have been asked how something like this can happen to someone so young. The honest answer is that we are only beginning to understand the biology that makes some brains vulnerable from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases like this underline why sustained investment in brain research, and the generosity of people willing to donate tissue, matters so deeply. The 24-year-old's story is a reminder that dementia is not a single disease, and not a problem confined to old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding why it happened will be one small step toward making sure it does not happen again.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/272972/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                                    
                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;A confirmed case of measles was reported in a person who traveled last week through Maryland while infectious, state health officials announced Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maryland Department of Health said the person traveled on trains from Jan. 7-8, &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/newsroom/Pages/Maryland%20Dept%20of%20Health%20issues%20notification%20of%20potential%20measles%20exposures%20associated%20with%20person%20who%20traveled%20through%20Maryland.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the agency said anyone who may have been near the following public areas may have been exposed:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak Northeast Regional train from Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station to D.C.’s Union Station from 9 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. on Jan. 7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amtrak’s BWI Marshall Airport shuttle bus to and from the BWI Marshall train station and the drop-off points outside of the lower level of the airport from 10:45 p.m. on Jan. 7 to 1:30 a.m. on Jan. 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BWI Marshall Airport parking shuttle bus to and from the lower levels outside of the BWI Marshall Airport and the airport’s long-term parking lots from 11 p.m. on Jan. 7 to 2 a.m. on Jan. 8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State health officials said people who were not in these locations at the times specified were not exposed to the infectious person while they were in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDH also said there were no exposures identified inside the terminals of the BWI Marshall Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agency said additional exposures sites occurred in other states, and that information related to those exposures will be provided by those states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/news/public-relations-contacts/news-releases/virginia-health-officials-investigating-a-confirmed-measles-case-in-northern-region/?utm_campaign=20260111_&amp;amp;utm_content=&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;separate statement&lt;/a&gt;, the Virginia Department of Health also flagged the Alexander T. Augusta Military Medical Center Emergency Department and Executive Medicine Suite in Fort Belvoir as a potential exposure site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials said anyone who traveled to the site Friday, from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 10 p.m. to midnight, may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VDH described the patient as a “preschool-age child” who had “recently traveled internationally.” The department said the incident marks the state’s second measles of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What to do if you’ve been exposed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think you’ve been exposed, MDH suggests finding out if you’ve been vaccinated for measles or have had it before. If you’ve gotten two doses of a measles vaccine, or were born before 1957, you are generally considered protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure if you’ve been immunized, check your status by calling your health care provider or &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/phpa/OIDEOR/IMMUN/Pages/immunet-for-public.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;requesting records&lt;/a&gt; through the My Immunization Record online portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you’re not fully vaccinated or otherwise immune to measles and you might have been exposed, contact your health care provider or your &lt;a href="https://health.maryland.gov/pages/departments.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;local health department&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the best next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MDH said exposed individuals need to monitor for any early signs of measles for 21 days after the initial potential exposure. Symptoms can range from runny nose, cough, red and watery eyes, and a fever exceeding 101 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If symptoms develop, the health agency stresses individuals must stay home, and to avoid public spaces. Individuals should contact a health care facility before arriving to any care centers.&lt;/p&gt;


                
                
                &lt;p class="After-content"&gt;
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;

Her research focuses on parasite infections and on community monitoring in El Paso, blending lab studies with fieldwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their surveillance focused on places where people and wildlife overlap, because that boundary creates chances for bugs to find new hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kissing-bugs-parasites-and-chagas-disease"&gt;Kissing bugs, parasites, and Chagas disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials say &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-%28american-trypanosomiasis%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chagas disease&lt;/a&gt;, a parasitic infection that can damage heart and gut, affects more than seven million people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parasite slips into muscle cells, which lets it hide for years and slowly scar the heart or digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long symptom-free stretches make routine detection hard, so many people learn about infection only after serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kissing bugs act as a vector, an insect that carries a parasite between hosts, when they feed on blood at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the bite, the insect can leave infected feces nearby, and the parasite enters through rubbed skin, eyes, or mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That messy route means simple contact matters, especially when bugs wander indoors or rest under porches and wood piles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 10 months, from April 2024 to March 2025, UTEP field teams checked traps across desert sites and neighborhood edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They set light traps about 3.3 feet above ground, then picked up adult bugs that flew in overnight. Because the team caught only adults, the data cannot yet show where the insects breed around homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tests-that-spot-the-parasite"&gt;Tests that spot the parasite&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the lab, researchers used polymerase chain reaction (&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/covid-virus-can-remain-in-sperm-months-after-infection/"&gt;PCR&lt;/a&gt;), a DNA test that detects tiny genetic traces, to screen each insect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They removed gut tissue, broke cells open in the buffer, and searched for &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/em&gt; DNA with special probes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A positive signal shows the parasite passed through that bug, but it does not prove the insect infected anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microscope checks identified every specimen as &lt;em&gt;Triatoma rubida&lt;/em&gt;, the species that turned up across the El Paso and Las Cruces sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collectors found adults in Franklin Mountains State Park and in residential areas, often tucked beneath shaded debris and outdoor structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mix of wild and built settings increases chances that people and pets encounter infected insects during everyday routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-infection-turns-chronic"&gt;Infection turns chronic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 survey, Maldonado’s group found &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; in 63.3 percent of collected bugs, far lower than today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; infections appear to be increasing,” said Maldonado. The new count comes from a small sample, so wider trapping will show whether the rise holds across seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people never notice the early illness, then enter the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stem-cell-therapy-improves-brain-activity-after-stroke/"&gt;chronic phase&lt;/a&gt;, the long stage after early infection, for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, parasites hide in heart and digestive muscles, which can trigger rhythm problems, heart failure, or enlarged organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials report that up to a third of chronically infected people later develop heart damage, even without new bites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pets-and-wildlife-complicate-risk"&gt;Pets and wildlife complicate risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild mammals can act as a reservoir, an animal host that keeps a parasite circulating, near parks and neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When bugs feed on infected animals, they pick up &lt;em&gt;T. cruzi&lt;/em&gt; and carry it to the next blood meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs and other pets can also get infected, so veterinarians often advise indoor sleeping in areas with kissing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-diagnosis-and-reducing-exposure"&gt;Diagnosis and reducing exposure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinics rarely test for Chagas disease in the United States, because many patients show no clear symptoms for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standard &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; relies on blood tests that detect antibodies, which rise after exposure even when parasites hide in tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without routine screening and reporting, health systems struggle to track local cases and to warn clinicians in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home repairs and yard cleanup can reduce encounters with kissing bugs, especially when summer heat increases exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seal cracks, add tight window screens, and move firewood away from walls where adult bugs hide in shade. Bringing pets indoors at night and dimming porch lights cuts two attractions that pull insects close to doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stopping-chagas-disease-parasites"&gt;Stopping Chagas disease parasites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local agencies can pair bug surveillance with public education, so residents know how to report insects and seek testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health departments can also map collections and prioritize outreach in areas where infected bugs cluster near schools, parks, and homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those steps cannot erase the parasite from wildlife, but they can reduce contact and speed treatment when infections occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the coming year, Maldonado’s group plans to offer blood screening to El Paso residents who might face repeated exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort would look for silent infections, then connect positive cases with medical follow-up before heart or gut disease appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanded testing of collected bugs could also clarify which parasite lineages circulate locally, a key step for long-term risk planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the borderland findings show how quickly a hard-to-detect parasite can move from desert habitats into daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular monitoring, basic home protection, and earlier testing offer practical ways to limit transmission while researchers measure how common human infection is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/endemic-potential-of-chagas-disease-in-the-us-southwest-updated-surveillance-of-infected-triatomines-from-the-usmexico-border-region/0FED22EE81FB6EBEF7B80657FE93FF9D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epidemiology and Infection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

It's given me everything back. I can see my child grow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I've gone from counting fingers and everything being really blurry to being able to see."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Currently, she can see and read most lines of letters on an eye test chart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She is one line away from what is legally required for driving - a massive change from being partially sighted, using a magnifying glass for anything close up and having to navigate around the house and outside largely using memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"If my vision stays like this for the rest of my life it would be absolutely brilliant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"I may not ever be able to drive again but I'll take that!" she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Nicki has regular eye checks to see how she is progressing&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;With hypotony, pressure within the eyeball becomes dangerously low, leading it to cave in on itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It can happen if there is poor production of the natural jelly-like fluid inside the eye, following trauma or inflammation, for example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Sometimes it's a side effect of eye surgery or certain medications. Without treatment people can go blind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Before now, doctors have tried using steroids and silicone oil to plump up the eye. But this can be toxic over long periods and doesn't restore much vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Even when the cells at the back of the eye used for sight are working, the silicone oil is difficult to see through, causing blurry vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The experts from Moorfields decided to try a different approach with something they already had in their cupboard - a low-cost, transparent, water-based gel called hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or HPCM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's already used in some types of eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But rather than using it as a one-off, the Moorfield's team decided to inject it into the main part of the eye as a new type of therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/086e/live/1054c260-eca3-11f0-9e5c-5102a53212cf.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="BBC News A blob of the clear gel on a fingertip, showing its viscosity and transparency." class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;BBC News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;The gel is clear or transparent, which allows better vision&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;When Nicki first had eyesight problems back in 2017, just after her son was born, she was initially given lots of silicone oil in her right eye, which was failing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She says it had lost its normal shape and "sort of collapsed" or "crumpled like a paper bag" due to hypotony.

&lt;p&gt;Those brief, intense workouts you’ve heard about that boost fitness might also help fight certain types of cancer by releasing molecules into the bloodstream that can spur DNA repair and inhibit cancer growth signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When embarking on an exercise routine for the new year, take heart that new research reveals that just 10 minutes of intense exercise could help fight cancer, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short bursts of energetic activity can trigger rapid molecular changes in the bloodstream, shutting down bowel cancer growth and speeding up DNA damage repair, a new study has shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Newcastle University have found that exercise increases the concentration of several small molecules in the blood—many linked to reducing inflammation, improving blood vessel function, and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When these exercise-induced molecules were applied to bowel cancer cells in the lab, the activity of more than 1,300 genes was altered, including those involved in DNA repair, energy production, and cancer cell growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings,&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.70271" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; published in the&lt;/a&gt; International Journal of Cancer, help explain one way exercise can protect against bowel cancer: by sending molecular signals in the bloodstream that influence the activity of genes that govern tumor growth and genome instability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is another step forwards in the fight against bowel cancer and further strengthens the importance of staying active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;‘Opens door to new treatments’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s remarkable is that exercise doesn’t just benefit healthy tissues, it sends powerful signals through the bloodstream that can directly influence thousands of genes in cancer cells,” &lt;a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/press/articles/latest/2025/12/exercisehelpsfightbowelcancer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Dr. Sam Orange&lt;/a&gt;, Senior Lecturer in Clinical Exercise Physiology at Newcastle University, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s an exciting insight because it opens the door to find ways that mimic or augment the biological effects of exercise, potentially improving cancer treatment and, crucially, patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the future, these insights could lead to new therapies that imitate the beneficial effects of exercise on how cells repair damaged DNA and use fuel for energy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Newcastle researchers found that exercise boosted the activity of genes that support mitochondrial energy metabolism, enabling cells to use oxygen more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, genes linked to rapid cell growth were switched off, which could reduce the aggressiveness of cancer cells, and exercise-conditioned blood promoted DNA repair, activating a key repair gene called PNKP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 30 volunteers, male and female aged 50–78, all overweight or obese (a risk factor of cancer) but otherwise healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After completing a short, intense cycling test lasting approximately 10 minutes, researchers collected blood samples and analysed 249 proteins. As many as 13 proteins increased after exercise, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which helps repair the DNA of damaged cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results suggest that exercise doesn’t just benefit healthy tissues, it may also create a more hostile environment for cancer cells to grow,” said Dr. Orange, a Clinical Exercise Physiologist at The Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Even a single workout can make a difference. One bout of exercise, lasting just 10 minutes, sends powerful signals to the body.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s a reminder that every step, every session, counts when it comes to doing your best to protect your health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer is the 4th most common cancer in the UK, after breast, prostate and lung—and it’s estimated that physical activity reduces the risk by approximately 20%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be done by going to the gym, playing sports or through active travel such as walking or biking to work, but also as part of household tasks or work like gardening or cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, researchers plan to test whether repeated exercise sessions produce lasting changes and explore how these effects interact with standard cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

Gaining weight despite trying to eat healthy, feeling sluggish, foggy or just not like yourself? You're not alone. Millions of Americans are unknowingly battling what scientists and doctors call metabolic dysfunction: an epidemic quietly affecting nearly 9 in 10 adults in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hidden cost of the "Standard American Diet"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the U.S. government introduced official dietary guidelines in 1977, there has been a drastic shift in how food is produced and consumed. Healthy fats were vilified. Processed carbohydrates were promoted. And food manufacturers quickly replaced fat with sugar and refined starches in nearly everything from breakfast cereal to salad dressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result? A skyrocketing rise in obesity, Type 2 diabetes, fatty liver and hormonal imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Joel Bikman, a long-time nutrition insider, "Most people today aren't just overfed, they're misfed — living in a constant state of metabolic confusion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are carbs the culprit?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While carbohydrates aren't inherently bad, the type and quantity matter. The average American consumes over 300 grams of carbs per day, much of it from ultra-processed sources. Excess carbs can spike insulin, the body's fat-storage hormone, and over time, lead to insulin resistance — the root of nearly every major chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of the three macronutrients, carbohydrates are the least necessary for the average adult and the most problematic for those struggling with metabolic problems," Bikman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why traditional dieting often backfires&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people try to cut calories or skip meals in an effort to lose weight, only to find themselves stuck, hungry, or regaining the weight months later. Bikman explained that while weight loss can happen with calorie restriction, it's often at the expense of lean muscle mass, which is critical for long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Losing lean mass is one of the most harmful things that can happen in dieting," Bikman said. "It's not just about looking good. Muscle plays a central role in how our body manages energy, burns fat, and even protects against chronic disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you lose muscle, your metabolism slows. Your strength fades. And your body becomes even more resistant to fat loss. It leads to a frustrating cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Role of fats and protein&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of cutting healthy sources of fat, we need to prioritize it — the right kinds, anyway. Healthy fats from sources like coconut, ghee, MCT oil, and olive oil help support hormone production, brain function, and metabolic flexibility. Pair that with complete proteins (including collagen, whey, and egg whites), and the body finally gets what it needs to burn fat, stay energized, and preserve muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But finding meals with the ideal ratio of protein, fat, and minimal carbs isn't easy, especially for busy people who don't want to cook five times a day or count every gram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Utah-born shake that's changing the game&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That challenge led Bikman and a team of experts to create &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;HLTH Code Complete Meal&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrient-dense shake that delivers optimal macros, essential vitamins and minerals, and metabolism-supporting ingredients — all in one delicious, convenient meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bikman said that HLTH Code is a science-backed solution that gives your body exactly what it needs to thrive. Each shake offers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;27 grams of complete protein (from whey, egg whites, and collagen).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Healthy fats from coconut oil, olive oil, flaxseed, and MCTs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Just 4 grams net carbs, making it ideal for low-carb or keto diets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prebiotic fiber, digestive enzymes, apple cider vinegar, probiotics and more.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are no added sugars, no artificial ingredients, and no corners cut.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Real people, real results&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/reviews/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Thousands of people&lt;/a&gt; across the country have now made HLTH Code a core part of their daily routine. Many report breakthroughs in fat loss, energy, mental clarity, digestion, and appetite control. The shakes are designed to be flexible:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace one meal per day for general wellness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replace two meals per day for weight loss or a metabolic reset.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use as a pre- or post-workout fuel to support lean muscle gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the thousands of five-star reviews, here are just a handful that tell of the power of HLTH Code:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David shared, "Lost 10 pounds in a week, coupled with intermittent fasting. Great product."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larry said, "I have lost 47 pounds using HLTH Code along with keto."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Cathy, "This meal replacement is delicious and satiating. I've been doing 2 shakes a day with one meal. This has helped me to lose 20 pounds in 3 months. Love it!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Mark T said, "Even though this one was more expensive than the other ones I've taken, this one is the best. It curves my appetite and I'm actually losing weight because my body is finally getting fed dense nutrition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in delicious flavors like Creamy Vanilla, Chocolate Macadamia, and new &lt;a href="https://gethlth.com/plant-based/?utm_source=KSL&amp;amp;utm_medium=advertorial" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;plant-based options&lt;/a&gt;, HLTH Code makes it simple to eat for health without sacrificing taste or convenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: HLTH Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why this isn't just another shake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most meal replacements that focus only on calories or protein, HLTH Code was developed from the ground up to support whole-body health: better insulin sensitivity, more energy, fewer cravings, and sustained weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bikman puts it, "We didn't create HLTH Code to just be a 'diet shake.' We built it to be the healthiest meal you can have — and one you'd actually look forward to drinking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Hlth Code&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've struggled with your weight, your energy, or your health, it's not your fault. We've all been misled by outdated food guidelines and quick-fix diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a better way, and thousands of people are now proving it every day.

                    &lt;p&gt;The family and friends of retired firefighter Ken Jones implored the city’s Health Service Board this week to persuade Blue Shield to reverse the denial of Jones’s crucial cancer treatment coverage through his city-run health plan, and many others have also been denied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://missionlocal.org/2026/01/s-f-firefighters-demand-answers-after-blue-shield-denies-cancer-coverage/"&gt;As Mission Local reports&lt;/a&gt;, Ken Jones and other retired firefighters gathered with their families at City Hall this week asking the city’s health board to intervene over Blue Shield’s denial of coverage for numerous members. Supervisor Matt Dorsey, who’s an appointee on the board, said the city switched from United Health Care last year with the impression it would provide better options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today I'm forced to stand here and beg because an insurance company decided that profits matter more than the life of a man who spent his career protecting this city," said Jones’s daughter Rachel Jones at the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He ran into burning buildings, inhaled toxic smoke, and put his life on the line again and again, so that others could survive,” Rachel Jones continued.  “Now, when he needs the help the most, the insurance company provided by this city through Blue Shield is denying him the medication his doctors say is necessary to keep him alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abc7news.com/post/san-francisco-firefighter-battling-stage-4-metastatic-lung-cancer-gets-treatment-denied-blue-shield-city-asked-intervene/18375388/"&gt;Per KGO&lt;/a&gt;, Dorsey said the board will investigate the firefighters’ claims. “I don't think that's what this board signed up for when we made the decision on the basis of the RFP process,” said Dorsey, per KGO. “I lost my own mother to lung cancer, and she raised a son who was going to fight, to make sure that people get this care that they're entitled to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/sf-firefighter-cancer-treatment-denied-insurance/4011273/"&gt;As NBC Bay Area reports&lt;/a&gt;, a fundraiser was set up to cover the treatment that was previously denied for Jones’s stage 4 metastatic lung cancer, which was paused on Wednesday when he was informed Blue Shield had refused to pay. The campaign reached its &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/blue-shield-denying-delaying-ken-joness-cancer-treatment"&gt;$50,000 goal&lt;/a&gt; over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6adBf_OPJGY?si=eXXxso8iMn8r6zp0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Firefighters, whether active or retired, should never have to beg for their lives,” said former Fire Chief Jeanine Nicholson at the board hearing, who’s also a cancer survivor, per NBC Bay Area. “This is not the first firefighter this has happened to, nor will it be the last if something doesn’t change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Mission Local, &lt;a href="https://www.cpf.org/health-and-safety/firefighter-presumptions/cancer-presumption"&gt;California labor law&lt;/a&gt; dictates that cancer diagnoses for firefighters be automatically presumed as tied to their job duties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/s-f-firefighters-get-new-gear-free-21235433.php"&gt;As the Chronicle reported&lt;/a&gt; last month, the San Francisco Fire Department just became one of the first in the country to make the move toward equipping its staff with gear that’s free of cancer-causing “forever chemicals,” which leach into the body over time — on top of the toxic chemicals firefighters encounter during active fires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our firefighters give this city their best, and we owe them nothing less in return,” Mayor Daniel Lurie said at a press conference last month celebrating the move. Per the Chronicle, over 400 SF firefighters have died from cancer since 2006, according to the San Francisco Firefighters Cancer Prevention Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first time the SF Health Service Board has had to step in over Blue Shield’s policies in the short time the company has been the city’s provider. In June, Supervisor Dorsey and SF City Attorney David Chiu &lt;a href="https://sfcityattorney.org/city-attorney-chiu-and-supervisor-dorsey-urge-blue-shield-to-keep-ucsf-in-network/"&gt;prompted the insurer&lt;/a&gt; to resolve a dispute with the University of California Health system that threatened access to care for thousands of members, including city and state workers, and an agreement &lt;a href="https://calretirees.org/Member-Resources/News/Details/uc-health-stays-in-network-for-calpers-blue-shield-members"&gt;was reached in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;

So far, scientists have found links from Neanderthal &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a20616/microsoft-is-packing-data-into-dna/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DNA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;DNA&lt;/a&gt; to everything from the shapes of modern noses to our &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a44200289/viking-disease-neanderthal-dna/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:propensity for diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;propensity for diseases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the recent study on pain, researchers investigated three variations in the SCN9A gene, and reported greater pain sensitivity among humans carrying all three variants. The SCN9A &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a45575538/horsehair-worm-horizontal-gene-transfer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gene;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt; builds sodium channels that help nerve cells communicate—in particular, it helps the cells alert the nervous system to a painful threat from damaged tissue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Authors say that the three gene variants were associated with a lower pain threshold for pricking the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a25418/bioprinter-print-human-skin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:skin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;skin&lt;/a&gt; after earlier exposure to mustard oil (which was used to sensitize the area), but were not associated with any changes in tolerance for pain caused by heat or pressure. Carrying all three variants increased pain sensitivity as compared to carrying only one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The sodium channel was actually recognized as “crucial” in the scope of pain pathways in 2020 by researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany and Sweden’s Karolinska Institutet. They suggested back then that Neanderthals experienced heightened pain sensitivity compared to modern &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a45230377/ancient-humans-created-super-fertile-dark-earth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:humans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the SCN9A gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But the earlier study didn’t fully explore the mechanical aspects of the increased pain sensitivity—the prick is more powerful than pressure or &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a18751978/the-arctic-is-experiencing-a-record-breaking-heat-wave/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt;. This recent study proposes that those holding the three Neanderthal variants have more sensitized sensory neurons, and are therefore able to warn the body of these poke-induced pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We have shown how variation in our &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a20100/synthetic-cell-has-worlds-smallest-genetic-code/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genetic code;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;genetic code&lt;/a&gt; can alter how we perceive pain,” Pierre Faux, first author and researcher at Aix-Marseille University and University of Toulouse, said in a news release, “including genes that modern humans acquired from the Neanderthals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;They also found that the three Neanderthal variants are more common in &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a45324146/human-populations-disappeared-found-again/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:populations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;populations&lt;/a&gt; with higher percentages of Native American ancestry. The study says that the variants are largely absent in Europeans and common in Latin Americans, thanks to what they call “population bottlenecks that occurred during the initial occupation of the Americas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The team now wants to know if this lower pain threshold offered up any sort of evolutionary benefit, or if increased pain sensitivity when poked is just another piece of Neanderthal &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a20722505/history-of-steel/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:history;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; living in modern humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPYVJyN2R1bXExTk9Lek8wTEFJbHpkSWl2MGI0ZmZuOTNUNnNaMktpak84QmVDZktQc2t5SEJ5cEg4Z0JfQ0pZSTJZU1pkT3hEemNIaWlnZTZCZlNReVc0Vm4zX3dVc2VZSWpDdlZQRWtWSElQUEY3WTY5QnVOZ0FxdzRjZEg4NlllSXppYVZsX3hvdjZpWjNBcnZIQTY4b1k</guid></item><item><title>可能导致体重增加的令人惊讶的“健康”零食- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/surprising-healthy-snack-may-causing-180000005.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Katey Davidson, M.Sc.FN, RD, CPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty Images.

It’s rich in protein, fiber and healthy fats. But trail mix can also be high in calories and added sugars, so portion size and ingredient quality matter. Without a mindful approach, those calories can quickly add up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s why dietitians say trail mix can be a sneaky source of extra calories and how to eat it more mindfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Trail Mix May Cause Hidden Weight Gain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It May Be Loaded with Added Sugars&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the trail mix you choose contains sweet ingredients like candy, yogurt-covered raisins or &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2057767/10-surprising-foods-with-more-sugar-than-a-glazed-donut/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dried fruit made with added sugars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;dried fruit made with added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, those added sugars can add up quickly. Added sugars are a leading reason why trail mix can sometimes contribute to weight gain, says &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the sugar in trail mix can help offer a quick boost of energy during endurance activities like hiking. But if you’re mostly sedentary, it may not be the best snack choice, says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends keeping calories from added sugars to  less than 10% of your total daily intake. “It may also be helpful to know that 4 grams of sugar is roughly about 1 teaspoon and the limit can be about 6 to 9 teaspoons a day,” adds Sauceda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s High in Calories and Easy to Overeat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trail mix is one of those foods that’s very easy to snack on mindlessly. You start with a handful, then grab another and another—often eating way more than you planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When it’s loaded with sweet or salty ingredients, it’s easy to lose track of how much you’ve eaten,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuts are highly nutritious and offer many health benefits, including &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;heart-healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;—but they can also be high in calories and are easy to overeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, there are other goodies that are almost always added to trail mixes, such as dried fruits, chocolate chips, coconut, oats, seeds, granola, dry cereals, pretzels and M&amp;amp;M’s,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dietitianmelissa.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melissa Hooper, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Melissa Hooper, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Although these taste good and it feels like a healthier snack since it’s not a candy bar or a cookie, [trail mix] can contain an average of 350 calories for ½ cup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s Not Actually a Meal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trail mix often contains fiber, protein and healthy fats, making it a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7891453/best-healthy-snacks-according-to-dietitians/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:well-rounded, nutritious snack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;well-rounded, nutritious snack&lt;/a&gt;—albeit one that’s potentially high in calories. But, let’s be real: it’s not a meal and won’t provide you with the same nutrients as a balanced lunch or dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since it’s calorie-dense, it might be a bit heavier than your normal snack, which means it can easily tide you over until your next meal,” Sauceda says. “But it shouldn’t be your meal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Eat Trail Mix More Mindfully&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you swear off trail mix altogether, it can still fit into a healthy eating pattern. “Trail mix is still a great option as a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/6-bad-snacks-that-actually-support-weight-loss-11684203" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:weight-loss snack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;weight-loss snack&lt;/a&gt;; you just need to be mindful of what’s in it and how much you eat,” explains Sauceda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips for eating it more mindfully:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the Nutrition Label and Ingredients. &lt;/strong&gt;Choose a trail mix with minimal added sugars. This might mean skipping options with candy, yogurt-coated snacks or sweetened dried fruit. “Instead, opt for mixes with unsweetened dried fruits, raw or roasted nuts, seeds and dark chocolate,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat with Intention. &lt;/strong&gt;Mindful eating can feel challenging in a world where we’re surrounded by screens and notifications, but paying attention to what you’re eating can make a big difference and prevent overeating. “Savor the flavors and textures instead of eating it mindlessly while working or watching TV,” Manaker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch Your Portions. &lt;/strong&gt;Instead of eating straight from the bag, measure out a serving size, which Manaker says is usually about ¼ cup. “I recommend preportioning serving sizes in snack-sized plastic bags as soon as you bring it home from the store, so each bag is ready for grab and go,” adds Hooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Your Own. &lt;/strong&gt;Trail mix is easy to make at home, requires few ingredients and can be customized to the flavors you love, says Hooper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthier Snack Options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homemade Energy Bites: &lt;/strong&gt;Made with ingredients like nut butter, whole grains, nuts and dried fruit, these keep you full and are easy to make ahead of time and portion. Get creative with flavors like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7916768/apple-pie-energy-balls/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Apple Pie;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Apple Pie&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/273188/carrot-cake-energy-bites/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Carrot Cake;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Carrot Cake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strained (Greek-Style) Yogurt with Nuts and Berries: &lt;/strong&gt;Snacks that combine protein and fiber or protein and a healthy fat tend to be a good choice, says Sauceda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veggies and Guacamole: &lt;/strong&gt;“Crunchy veggies like carrots, celery or bell peppers paired with guacamole are satisfying and nutrient-packed,” says Manaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veggies with Hummus: &lt;/strong&gt;Hummus pairs well with plenty of veggies, like baby carrots, cucumbers, bell peppers, snap peas, celery and broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air-Popped Popcorn: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s low in calories, high in fiber and you can season it with spices you love, like this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251407/lime-parmesan-popcorn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lime &amp;amp; Parmesan Popcorn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Lime &amp;amp; Parmesan Popcorn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fresh Fruit with Nut Butter&lt;/strong&gt;: “Sliced apples or bananas with a small amount of almond or peanut butter offer natural sweetness and healthy fats,” shares Manaker. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trail mix contains fiber, healthy fats and protein that can make for a quick, nutritious snack. But it can also be high in calories and added sugars, and it’s easy to overeat. While it can fit into a healthy eating pattern, paying attention to the ingredients and portion sizes helps to keep calories and sugar in check. Alternatively, opt for other healthy snack options, like homemade energy balls, air-popped popcorn and fresh fruit with a bit of nut butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-healthy-snack-that-may-be-causing-weight-gain-11880764" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EatingWell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EatingWell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:34:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNMXBac2p1Q0NBQjNWYjlQUXFlakQzMDBpckh6cTlEeGQzb2RXY1BIVGRPUW5hOEtES2d3bFlHY3dtLUQ4T3B2UVFfWXY2QV9yTzRhYVpfdXN6OUhxV011VkEtQmFGSloxNTNPNEd4N1VkWXJqUGR6N194QmhramNBbVlHOHF3QUk</guid></item><item><title>关于威胁数百万人的隐性Ozempic副作用的新警告-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15436043/epidemic-ozempic-muscle-loss-fall-risk.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-74da2030-ebdc-11f0-953f-db762ab9609b" class=""&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; drugs are slimming America's waistline, but this miracle cure may come at a hidden cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in eight adults are now taking GLP-1 medications, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll. That adds up to over 30 million people and the figure is only expected to rise after a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-15437117/fat-jabs-weight-loss-drug-Wegovy-pill-UK.html"&gt;pill version of Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; secured &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/fda/index.html" id="mol-2a14af10-ef0c-11f0-95c5-2fd97e7ade78"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; approval, adding a needle-free option to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors have praised the drugs for helping people shed pounds with little more than a weekly injection. And studies show that patients who lose weight slash their risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and dementia, among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But amid the frenzy, some experts are issuing warns over a possible future epidemic, linked to GLP-1 drugs that threatens to save years off otherwise healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Marc Estes, an emergency medicine physician in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/indiana/index.html" id="mol-566ce3a0-ebda-11f0-953f-db762ab9609b" class=""&gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt;, told Daily Mail: 'One hundred percent of clients on weight loss drugs see at least some muscle loss. I don’t think anyone who is on actual weight loss doses will see zero percent muscle loss.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Douglas Ewing, a bariatric surgeon in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-2a172010-ef0c-11f0-95c5-2fd97e7ade78"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, added to Daily Mail: 'Less than five or 10 percent of patients complain about muscle loss, but it is something that probably more people than that would notice if you dug deeper. Muscle wasting is rarely symptomatic.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are warning over a silent epidemic that could be caused by weight loss drugs. The above is a stock image of Ozempic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Estes pointed to analyses of eight large US and European studies, which suggest that, on average, 25 to 35 percent of the weight lost on the drugs is muscle, bone or other lean mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38937282/"&gt;Other research&lt;/a&gt; has warned that the figure could be even higher, with some studies estimating that 40 to 60 percent of total weight loss is lean tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Muscle is essential for movement, stability and overall health. Losing a significant amount raises the risk of falls and, with them, potentially debilitating injuries, experts warn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the average Ozempic user being 50 to 64 years old, according to the same KFF poll, experts fear the drugs could accelerate the muscle loss already experienced around that age and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-11673557/Miracle-weight-loss-drug-trending-TikTok-cause-facial-aging.html"&gt;raise the risk of sarcopenia, progressive decline in muscle mass due to aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That increases the risk of falls that lead to head injuries, broken bones and other complications that can reduce lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But muscle loss could also affect younger adults in their 30s and 40s, experts say, if they suffer from falls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Will Haas, a weight loss doctor in North Carolina, warned&lt;span&gt; 'I do believe that could be the potential if the trend isn't turned around and the right education and support are not in place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If the nation sees people losing weight during their 30s and 40s, and also losing muscle mass, that trend could follow them well into other decades of life.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alexandra Collett, 31, from the UK, lost 136lbs on Ozempic, but afterward found herself spending thousands removing loose skin and having a breast reduction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC says that unintentional falls are already the leading cause of injury-related death among adults over the age of 65 years, with more than 41,000 dying from them every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The death rate from falls among adults aged 65 years and older is also rising. The CDC said the rate increased 70 percent from 2003 to 2023 among adults aged 65 to 74 years, and more than 75 percent for those aged 75 to 84 years. Among the over-85s, it has more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear why this is happening, but experts have suggested it is down to the use opioids and antidepressants in older adults, which can cause dizziness and leave these adults at greater risk of losing their balance. Weight loss drugs may only add to this trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Users of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs are urged to eat a high-protein diet and do strength training at least twice a week to help prevent muscle loss while on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But doctors report trouble getting patients to follow these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear what proportion of patients on weight loss drugs may not be following diet or exercise recommendations, but in a &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC546419/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;comparable paper from 2004&lt;/a&gt;, where scientists tracked 4,000 obese adults taking prescription weight loss drugs, researchers found only 27 percent reported eating fewer calories and following the physical activity recommendations from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ewing added: 'Compliance, overall, is a difficult problem when you are dealing with diet and exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you don't have continual follow-up in the clinic, if you don't have the educational resources, if you don't have objective criteria, then you are less likely to be able to coax your patients slowly into better habits.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Shown above is Dr Douglas Ewing, who raised concerns about the future because of weight loss drugs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said that about 60 to 75 percent of patients at his clinic comply, but that when this does not happen, they provide patients with extra resources to encourage them to follow the diet and exercise recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All weight loss plans lead to at least some muscle loss, doctors say, but add that normally this is only around 15 to 20 percent of total weight lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, Dr Haas said that, for now, the benefits of weight loss drugs for obese individuals, when used with diet and exercise, outweigh the risks in his view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told Daily Mail: 'For many patients, the rewards of true weight loss can absolutely outweigh the risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These changes can include positive effects on blood sugar levels, blood pressure, sleep apnea, joint pain and quality-of-life changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, it is not just a function to promote weight loss but to promote good health. This is best achieved through weight loss coupled with preservation of muscle mass, nutritional support, and lifestyle changes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other doctors disagreed that muscle wasting posed a major risk for users of Ozempic and other weight loss drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Holly Lofton, an obesity medicine expert in New York, told Daily Mail: 'There are scientific articles which have demonstrated that there is no excessive muscle wasting in patients taking GLP-1s versus those losing weight without meds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors are expecting more people to start using weight loss drugs in the future (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is important that the prescriber of GLP1s also provide the support for lifestyle management or refer to someone else skilled in such.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors also warned that weight loss drugs may raise the risk of gallstones, or hard deposits, like tiny pebbles, that form from digestive fluid in the gallbladder, a gland near the pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted the drugs may raise the risk of these complications because the rapid weight loss they cause can alter bile composition and reduce gallbladder emptying, causing bile to stagnate in the gland and become stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The stones are painful, but can be removed with surgery. Patients generally do not suffer long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ewing told Daily Mail: 'I tell my patients gallstones and gallbladder problems are one thing they should keep in mind. Any time you lose weight, you risk developing these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We do see a lot of patients with gallbladder problems already. I can't really say whether we are seeing an uptick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jan 2026 18:10:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxNRFhzaWMtYmQzd254N015dUNQSjN3bjlPQm9nQVY0UWs4WFZRZ3htOXRkcWczT2lyU0sxaUJRLV9lZF9sQjZhcEVlN2tJSTc2QjJMVnlSSDhVc1l4dGJPSU5mZjk2eUJheFU3aHNHeHdnVFhvMnMzOUlxUjI1bGJMX2ZMcjJzcnB3eWpqV29HUmxUUmxLczhtNzQxcw</guid></item><item><title>科学家们制造了这种片上肺呼吸。然后他们给了它结核病。- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-made-this-lung-on-a-chip-breathe-then-they-gave-it-tb</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Tuberculosis has plagued humanity for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-bone-eating-pathogen-from-thousands-of-years-ago-is-still-circulating-inside-us"&gt;thousands of years&lt;/a&gt;, and despite medical advances that can now help us prevent and cure it, the ancient bacterial disease still &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/worlds-top-infectious-killer-claimed-1-23-million-lives-last-year-who-says"&gt;claims more human lives&lt;/a&gt; per year than any other infectious pathogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers unveil a device meant to demystify the early stages of TB, including a peculiar delay that often precedes the onset of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their model could also reveal how genetic variations in patients lead to varying effects of TB, with potentially broad implications for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-crucial-reading-in-your-blood-can-predict-future-disease-risk"&gt;personalized medicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;a quarter of our species&lt;/a&gt; is infected with TB bacteria, and while only a fraction of those people will become sick, that still amounts to more than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis"&gt;10 million new cases&lt;/a&gt; – and more than 1 million deaths – per year worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TB progresses slowly, with symptoms often taking months to appear. To learn more about this lag, the authors focused on tiny air sacs in the lungs, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/we-ve-found-a-brand-new-cell-type-in-our-lungs"&gt;pulmonary alveoli&lt;/a&gt;, which host pivotal confrontations between immune cells and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The air sacs in the lungs are a critical first barrier against infections in humans, but we've traditionally looked at them in animals like mice," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; co-author Max Gutierrez, who leads the Host-Pathogen Interactions in Tuberculosis Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These studies are fundamental for our understanding, but animals and humans have differences in the makeup of immune cells and disease progression, sparking interest in alternative technologies," Gutierrez &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-recreate-a-whole-body-s-worth-of-organoids-just-one-millionth-of-the-size"&gt;organ-on-a-chip&lt;/a&gt;" technology, for instance, lets scientists simulate a full human organ within a microfluidic cell culture microchip, offering an alternative to animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some "lung-on-a-chip" systems already exist, but limitations of those models inspired Gutierrez and his colleagues to try a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until now, lung-on-chip devices have been made of a mixture of patient-derived and commercially available cells," Gutierrez &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "This means that they can't fully recreate the lung function or disease progression of a single individual, as each type of cell is genetically different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers instead developed a new lung-on-a-chip for their study, featuring only genetically identical cells derived from a single human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="187962" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We used human induced pluripotent  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="187962" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which can virtually become any cell in the body, to produce type I and II alveolar epithelial cells," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; first author Jakson Luk, a postdoctoral fellow in Gutierrez's lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188105" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188105" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2.jpg" alt="lung-on-a-chip infected by TB bacteria" class="size-full wp-image-188105" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2-450x675.jpg 450w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/lung-on-chip-TB2-600x900.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188105" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A lung-on-chip infected by &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;, with cell nuclei in blue, dead macrophage in magenta, tight epithelial-endothelial junctions in yellow, and TB bacteria in white.

"Using the same stem cells, we also produced vascular endothelial cells that are grown on the bottom of the membrane."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This offered a novel look at the 'black box' period of TB, or the time between a person's initial infection and the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-ancient-disease-has-reappeared-in-the-us-this-could-be-why"&gt;onset of symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to look for hallmarks of disease that have been reported in patients from the clinic and animal studies," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When researchers added immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-trick-a-faulty-immune-system-into-repairing-the-gut-of-mice"&gt;macrophages&lt;/a&gt; to the chip before introducing TB, they soon noticed macrophage clusters with "necrotic cores" – a central group of dead macrophages nestled in a larger group of live ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Eventually, five days after infection, the endothelial and epithelial cell barriers collapsed, showing that the air sac function had broken down," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone's lungs react to TB the same way, however, so the researchers also sought to learn how genetic differences can lead to varying responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We removed the ATG14 gene, which is involved in a natural process for degrading damaged cells and foreign materials," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Macrophages lacking this gene were more susceptible to cell death in resting conditions, and tried to engulf more TB bacteria when infected, confirming the gene's role in keeping our immune defenses intact," he &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research will be needed, but Luk and his colleagues see their chip as a key step toward more personalized treatment of TB – and other infections, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We could now build chips from people with particular genetic mutations to understand how infections like TB will impact them and test the effectiveness of treatments like antibiotics," Luk &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The chip supports the big push into personalized medicine," Gutierrez &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2026-01-01_built-to-breathe-mini-lungs-recreate-individual-response-to-infection"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;. "It could help us understand the impact of genetics on whether a treatment is effective or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aea9874"&gt;Science Advances&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
