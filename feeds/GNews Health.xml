            People who have higher levels of strong, agile sperm may live nearly three years longer than those with poor swimmers incapable of making it to their destination,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to new research. The large-scale study followed more than 78,000 men for 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000g3b6mqvemisx3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ability of sperm to properly swim through the female reproductive tract to reach and fertilize an egg is called motility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000h3b6msqm5o603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In absolute terms, men with a total motile count of more than 120 million (per milliliter of semen) lived 2.7 years longer than men with a total motile count of between 0 and 5 million,” said lead study author Lærke Priskorn, a researcher and doctoral candidate at Copenhagen University Hospital — Rigshospitalet in Denmark, in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000i3b6mnpv7y7lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To translate that into ages, a man with extremely poor sperm motility might be expected to live up to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;77.6 years, while a man with extremely high motility might survive to 80.3 years, according to the study &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humrep/deaf023" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Human Reproduction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000j3b6mgjodmhfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fact that there is an association between semen quality and longevity is an important finding,” said Dr. Michael Eisenberg, professor of urology and director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine. He was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000k3b6mwu5eash6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There have been prior studies that suggest this link between reproductive health and overall health,” Eisenberg said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000l3b6mtqeygho0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the new report, researchers compared the quality of sperm samples taken between 1965 and 2015 from men undergoing infertility testing in Copenhagen. The quality of the men’s sperm was then compared with national medical records gathered by the Danish national health service.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000m3b6m7k9mwti4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The lower the semen quality, the lower the life expectancy,” Priskorn said. “This association was not explained by any diseases in the ten years before semen quality assessment or the men’s educational level.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000n3b6m9ndhmxv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Motility counts are typically provided in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929669/" target="_blank"&gt;percentages,&lt;/a&gt; not total numbers. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers a man’s sperm normal if about 42% of the sperm in each sample of ejaculate is capable of swimming to their destination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000o3b6mo032c7zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, a motility count of less than 5 million per milliliter of semen&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is associated with a severe case of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22477-oligospermia-low-sperm-count" target="_blank"&gt;oligospermia&lt;/a&gt;, or low sperm count, which often leads to male infertility, the study said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000p3b6m73x8jkvq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sperm motility of about 125 million per milliliter of semen is normal for a fertile male, Eisenberg said. However, that doesn’t guarantee male fertility, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000q3b6mdit0i6s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If not for fertility, why would testing semen be a benefit? Because it could also be a marker for male health problems at younger ages, said John Aitken, a distinguished professor emeritus from the School of Environmental and Life Sciences at the University of Newcastle, Australia, who was not connected to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000r3b6m1kxuiczv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In men, it appears to be their semen profile that is providing the most significant information concerning their future health and wellbeing,” Aitken wrote &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humrep/deaf027" target="_blank"&gt;in an editorial&lt;/a&gt; published alongside the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000s3b6mdbkesnwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If spermatozoa really are the canaries in the coal mine of male health, the obvious question to ask is, why?” Aitken posited. “What possible factors could link the ultimate life expectancy of males with the quality of their semen profile in early adulthood?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000t3b6mzxst3ngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Aitken, one answer explaining the association might be oxidative stress, caused when free radicals run rampant. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage DNA and cellular function and lead to cell death throughout the body, including the testes and sperm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000u3b6mstkpzyhp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any factor (genetic, immunological, metabolic, environmental or lifestyle) that enhances overall levels of oxidative stress, could reasonably be expected to drive changes in the semen profile and subsequent patterns of mortality,” Aitken posited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000v3b6mt39cgbjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Smoking, excessive alcohol, sun exposure, pesticides, industrial chemicals and air pollutants are just a few of the ways free radicals are activated, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000w3b6mn42ie0h7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body does have a way to fight back — with antioxidants. Nicknamed “free radical scavengers,” antioxidants can prevent and repair damage caused by some types of free radicals, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000x3b6mvemsz3z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While supplements have failed to show promise against free radicals, fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains with key vitamins and minerals are excellent sources of antioxidants, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000y3b6mdt5yuadh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Citrus fruits, red and green peppers, and broccoli are full of the antioxidant vitamin C, while nuts, sunflower seeds, spinach and broccoli are good sources of vitamin E, another antioxidant, the clinic &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank"&gt;states on its website&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000z3b6m7zt8t1b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Salmon and tuna contain selenium, as does brown rice, eggs and whole wheat bread. Beta carotene, another antioxidant, can be found in carrots, apricots, kale, mangos and sweet potatoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

We continue to monitor the situation. If there is a confirmed case of measles, the OSDH will notify the public and share information necessary to protect the public's health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSDH later said in a statement: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt; "The individual was negative for measles but positive for having immunity.&lt;br&gt; There is a process for confirming a case of measles, and that can only be done through the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH). While residents may be tested and diagnosed at a health care facility, that facility must work with the OSDH to confirm a positive case. Many factors contribute to having a confirmed positive case. It is important to be aware of what type of test is conducted. If measles is suspected, multiple types of tests can be performed to determine if measles is present or if the individual has immunity to measles." "Health care facilities and schools are encouraged to follow their normal reporting processes to OSDH to ensure timely public health investigations. These processes should be followed prior to any public posting about reportable diseases. The OSDH is monitoring the situation and will notify the public and news media if/when a case is confirmed in Oklahoma. In the meantime, if you receive information about a case that is not directly from the OSDH, please contact us before reporting." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="Quote-attribution"&gt;Oklahoma State Department of Health&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartlesville Public Schools said "a staff member at Wayside Elementary School was diagnosed with measles by an Oklahoma hospital. However, the Oklahoma State Department of Health has not been able to confirm that diagnosis." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 News is reaching out to the school district and the Oklahoma State Department of Health to clarify the initial alert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartlesville Public Schools issued a warning after a staffer at an elementary school tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on the district's Facebook page, they said a staffer in Wayside Elementary School tested positive for the measles on March 4, one day after being inside the school. Custodians at that school did complete a deep cleaning and are now going back over as many areas as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and airborne disease. Most people in the United States have a low risk for contracting it due to a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child who was not vaccinated has died from measles in West Texas, the first death in an outbreak that began late last month and the first from measles in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kjrh.com/health/cdc-deploys-rapid-response-officers-to-texas-to-address-the-measles-outbreak" class="ListItem " data-cms-ai="0"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.bps-ok.org/page/measles" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;The school posted about the disease on their website to help inform parents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district included specific vaccination rates for their students: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;As of March 2025, 92% of the district's students had received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, 3% had received 1 dose, and the remaining 5% had received no doses or their status was unclear in our database.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Analysis of human brain tissue revealed differences in how immune cells behave in brains with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="153764" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease compared to healthy brains, indicating a potential new treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Washington-led research, published in 2023, discovered &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were &lt;span&gt;in a pre-inflammatory state &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;more frequently, making them less likely to be protective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglia are immune cells that help keep our brains healthy by clearing waste and preserving normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to infection or to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-scientists-capture-video-of-brains-clearing-out-dead-neurons"&gt;clear out dead cells&lt;/a&gt;, these nifty shape-shifters can become less spindly and more mobile to engulf invaders and rubbish. They also &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1202529"&gt;'prune' synapses during development&lt;/a&gt;, which helps shape the circuitry for our brains to function well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's less certain what part they play in Alzheimer's, but in people with the devastating neurodegenerative disease, some microglia respond too strongly and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/imcb.12301"&gt;may cause inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that contributes to the death of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153764" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaa109"&gt;anti-inflammatory medications for Alzheimer's haven't shown significant effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143533" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Blue neurons connecting " class="size-medium wp-image-143533" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143533" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Computer Illustration of a synapse between two neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADmTH5y7O4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look closer at the role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease, University of Washington neuroscientists Katherine Prater and Kevin Green, along with colleagues from multiple US institutions, used brain autopsy samples from research donors – 12 who had Alzheimer's and 10 healthy controls – to study the gene activity of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new method to enhance &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNA-seq"&gt;single-nucleus RNA sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, the team was able to identify in depth 10 different clusters of microglia in the brain tissue based on their unique set of gene expression, which tells the cells what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;hree of the clusters hadn't been seen before, and one of them was more common in people with Alzheimer's disease. This type of microglia has genes turned on that are involved in inflammation and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that microglia clusters in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to be those in a pre-inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means they were more likely to produce inflammatory molecules that can damage brain cells and possibly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microglia types in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were less likely to be protective, compromising their ability to pull their weight in cleaning up dead cells and waste and promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg" alt="Photomicrograph of microglia from a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease." class="size-full wp-image-103339" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-589x415.jpg 589w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-600x422.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photomicrograph of microglia (green) from a brain affected by Alzheimer's. (&lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;Lexi Cochoit/UW Neuroinflammation Lab&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists also think microglia can change types over time. So we can't just look at a person's brain and say for sure what type of microglia they have; keeping track of how microglia change over time could help us understand how they contribute to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At this point, we can't say whether the microglia are causing the pathology or whether the pathology is causing these microglia to alter their behavior," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Prater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research advances our understanding of these cells' role in Alzheimer's disease and suggests certain microglia clusters may be targets for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is hopeful that their work will lead to the development of new therapies that can improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now that we have determined the genetic profiles of these microglia, we can try to find out exactly what they are doing and hopefully identify ways to change their behaviors that may be contributing to Alzheimer's disease," Prater &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can determine what they are doing, we might be able to change their behavior with treatments that might prevent or slow this disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00424-y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers said the findings are concerning, especially because rates of throat and tongue cancers in men linked to HPV are rising.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;45% of those surveyed did not know of other cancer risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the survey included 1,005 respondents who completed the survey in early February of this year.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among respondents, 45% did not know if HPV was linked to cancers other than cervical cancer. A similar percentage, 42%, said HPV was more common in women than in men. HPV is actually more common in men, but only women are screened for the virus, the authors said.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is concerning because more men are infected with HPV than women and they could unknowingly spread it to their partners,” said Electra Paskett, PhD, a professor in The Ohio State University College of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/news/hidden-dangers-and-myths-what-you-need-to-know-about-hpv-and-cancer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in a press release &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;from the university’s Wexner Medical Center.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tonsil and tongue-based cancers could become most common&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, many of the cancers caused by HPV, including cervical and oropharyngeal (tonsil and tongue base) do not produce symptoms until they are advanced. Ohio State researchers said the rapidly rising rates of HPV-related oropharyngeal (tonsil and tongue base) cancers could be among the most common forms of cancer in adults between the ages of 45 and 65 years old if trends continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once exposed, there are currently no treatments for HPV infections, and many who are unvaccinated unknowingly carry and spread high-risk strains of the virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can take years or even decades for the genetic changes caused by HPV to take effect and transform into cancer,” said Matthew Old, MD, a head and neck surgeon at Ohio State. “Once exposed, there are currently no treatments for HPV infections, and many who are unvaccinated unknowingly carry and spread high-risk strains of the virus. That’s why vaccination is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, 42 million Americans are estimated to have HPV.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cervical cancer mortality higher in rural counties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In related news, a cross-sectional study found a recent increase in cervical cancer incidence in rural US counties, specifically among white women, and the incidence was 25% higher and mortality 42% higher in rural counties in recent years.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830824"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The study &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;was published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open, &lt;/em&gt;and authors said the findings underscore discrepancies in vaccine uptake and lower screening coverage in rural areas.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data came from the National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (NPCR-SEER) database. Between 2001 and 2019, 222,425 cervical cancer cases were identified, of which 84.3% were from urban counties and 59.9% were in White women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cervical cancer incidence increased by 0.85% per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08% to 2.05%) in rural counties from 2012 to 2019 after decreasing from 2001 to 2012. Incidence in urban counties decreased from 2001 to 2013, then plateaued from 2013 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Overall, mortality was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.33 to 1.51) times higher in rural vs urban counties during 2015 to 2019,” the authors said. Rural Black, White, and Hispanic women were all more likely to die from cervical cancer compared to urban counterparts.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings from this study highlight the importance of enhancing preventive care (HPV vaccination and screening access) in rural US counties, which remains suboptimal in comparison with their urban counterparts,” the authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr., the health secretary who has drawn criticism for his muted response to the outbreak.

The partnership, known as an Epi-Aid, is a rapid-response effort in which the Epidemic Intelligence Service Officers — the “disease detectives” — will provide local officials support for one to three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The measles outbreak in Texas is a call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health,” Mr. Kennedy said in the statement. “By working together — parents, health care providers, community leaders and government officials, we can prevent future outbreaks and protect the health of our nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can be life-threatening.

The two doses are typically given in a combination measles-mumps-rubella, or M.M.R., vaccine and prevent more than 97 percent of measles infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Kennedy said last week that the administration was supporting the Texas Department of Health through “technical assistance and vaccines,” including sending 2,000 M.M.R. shots and providing laboratory support for better tracking the virus that is causing the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;He said Health and Human Services officials had also been in communication with local public health officials, and had updated the C.D.C. website with guidance on how to manage the disease — including administering vitamin A, which &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown can help treat measles&lt;/a&gt; in malnourished children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But Mr. Kennedy has not used his bully pulpit to encourage vaccination. A longtime critic of vaccines who has used his platform to suggest, without evidence, that the measles vaccine causes autism, Mr. Kennedy has repeatedly said that he is not anti-vaccine, he is simply pro-choice, and wants parents to have enough information to make decisions about vaccination on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;He initially &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html" title=""&gt;downplayed the measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; during a Cabinet meeting last week, when he dismissed the child’s death as “not unusual.” Over the weekend, he switched gears, writing an opinion piece for Fox News in which he offered only a tepid endorsement of vaccination, saying the vaccine can “protect individual children from measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-2"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But his message came with a caveat. “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 19:31:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE05T2syZWZyQjBRSWd5b0hPbVhtS1JhdU1DYmV2MS1kcnZEdkpqNjZvUFoxNTBKaUZvTFJ2d3VBZmU0QW03azJDaU1adUNRX3NEY1ZiWno2TUdycWhPMFA5bGFjeDBnb0dUcFJDaG9BMF9lZnZzQUR3WEYzNUk</guid></item><item><title>As Measles Spreads, Kennedy Embraces Remedies Like Cod Liver Oil - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPU3BKVnNiQllwLW9qb0JGTEh6dVVYRXZQMGVvTXZZQzM2aWpKZXVIYmYyUVlZcXd6dkt2WWlFd1pQOFRHX3FWalVxNEE3SmE1b2J0c2hxOEpGaGdZd01ScnowTENrRWRGbno5RE15bHRqY2p5OW9YcUthS0pPUUJWZ0pUMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;As a measles outbreak expands in West Texas, Robert F.

                    &lt;p&gt;Tossing and turning more as you age? You’re not alone — and experts think they know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drshelbyharris.com/"&gt;Dr. Shelby Harris&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep psychologist in White Plains, N.Y., explained that stress, sleep structure and hormonal changes can impact sleep as people age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"As we start to move into our 60s, 70s, you have more issues with the depth of your sleep, so your sleep is just lighter in general," Harris told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt;. "There's sleep disorders, like &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/sleep-disorder/why-can-t-i-sleep-2659520817.html"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt;, that happens, and then you have to go to the bathroom more at night."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28159095/"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; up to 70% of people 65 and older have chronic sleep problems, and hormonal shifts play a big role in that, especially for women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have more hot flashes, night sweats. You actually have more sleep apnea in women as well, and just more insomnia too," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There may also be some evolutionary reasoning behind why older adults get less deep sleep, Harris added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The deepest stage of sleep is where your muscles are repairing, you're growing — and as you're getting older, you don't need that ideally as much as you do when you're younger," Harris said, adding that younger kids get a lot of deep sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"(Older adults) just wake up a lot more because of pain and movement and having to urinate," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What's more, Harris told &lt;em&gt;CBS News&lt;/em&gt; it’s a myth that older adults don’t need much sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"If a doctor tells you that is normal to get a lot less as you get older, definitely seek some other advice," Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with keeping a cool, dark and quiet sleep environment, she offered these tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Meditate during the day. “If you have a busy brain, meditating five minutes during the day can help to actually ease your brain more at night,” Harris said.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Limit daytime sleep. To try and get better sleep at night, you can also try spending less time in bed during the day, Harris added. That means reducing naps. &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Stick to a regular bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If sleep issues last more than a few weeks, it’s important to talk with a doctor, Harris urged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We do have a lot of treatments like cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, you might need a sleep study, medication," she said. "We have lots of options." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


                    

                    
                &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Called a 'Labia Puff', the procedure injects &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebs-are-getting-their-filler-dissolved-but-is-everyone-else-8772012" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; or fat into the labia majora, the outer lips of a woman’s genitals, to give it a fuller look. As Dr. Karen Leong, a plastic surgeon who offers the procedure &lt;a href="https://drkarenleong.com/surgical/vaginal-rejuvenation/labia-puff/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;, “a ‘labia puff’ can give you a younger, more rejuvenated-looking vulva. As collagen production slows down with age, it is possible for sagging and wrinkles to appear on our bodies, including the vulva area.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But “while older women often want rejuvenation after childbirth or menopause,"  plastic surgeon &lt;a href="https://www.irasavetskymd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Ira Savetsky&lt;/a&gt; told&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/03/health/labia-puff-surgery-makes-vaginas-look-more-youthful-say-plastic-surgeons/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;The New York Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, younger women "who have lost weight" are seeking the procedure as well, looking for "volume restoration."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Some women feel that this change makes the area look aged or less aesthetically pleasing,” Savetsky added.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These &lt;a href="https://people.com/lisa-rinna-talks-beauty-and-dissolving-facial-fillers-exclusive-8641764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; can carry a price tag of up to $5,000. But plastic surgeon &lt;a href="https://biancamolinamd.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Bianca Molina&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;em&gt;NYP&lt;/em&gt;, the procedure is “super hot right now.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Reddit’s r/Menopause community sounded off on the procedure, with one &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1fmg6ci/comment/loakza0/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Redditor&lt;/a&gt; saying, “I am on my 2nd UTI in six months and the whole mess down there is on fire. I cannot begin to think what filler in the flaps would feel like.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Normal aging will deflate the labia a little …  IT’S OK! No one cares,” wrote another &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1fmg6ci/comment/lobpc6i/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Redditor&lt;/a&gt;. “The idea that women think they need filler to make their labia look better is ridiculous and a very sad statement about our culture.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But another &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1fmg6ci/comment/loayy6w/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Redditor&lt;/a&gt; said that it’s not about the appearance of your labia, but about physical comfort: “Things like sitting, walking, and sex were very painful. The filler made everything much better, and I do not have pain any longer. I think it’s a viable treatment for people who have similar issues.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And as one Redditor&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DIYaesthetics/comments/1g5bauc/comment/lsf63be/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, that the criticism is misogynistic: “Not sure why ppl are clutching their pearls over this when these micro [erectile dysfunction] guys out here jacking up their Johnsons with fillers for years.

The response would also require a lot of people to conduct contact tracing and, if Ebola is the culprit, could involve vaccinating infected people’s close contacts. Additionally, because these viruses spread from person to person, there would be a greater chance the infection could spread outside the region where it starts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The hemorrhagic fever scenario would be more concerning. Between 2014 and 2016, Ebola killed &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://libguides.mskcc.org/publichealth/VHF" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;11,000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone in the largest outbreak of that infection on record; another large outbreak in the DRC led to nearly 2,300 deaths between 2018 and 2020. &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ebola-and-marburg-haemorrhagic-fevers-outbreaks-and-case-locations#full-publication-update-history" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;Multiple smaller outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of related viruses sporadically erupt across the continent, including two active outbreaks in Tanzania and Uganda, the latter of which recently claimed the life of a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/health/ebola-elon-musk-doge.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;four-year-old boy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the toolkit for responding to these outbreaks has come a long way: new vaccines – which may soon include &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp4kqer46o" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;one being trialed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Uganda – have &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/ebola/ebola-vaccine-cut-deaths-half-during-drc-outbreak-study-shows" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;dramatically reduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the risk of death due to Ebola infection.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;(&lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/high-cases-flu-season" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b class="cXscX "&gt;This is the worst flu season in 15 years.

The first people involved in the outbreak had reportedly eaten meat from wild bats, which has raised some concern that a hemorrhagic fever virus, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/bat-species-may-be-source-ebola-epidemic-killed-more-11000-people-west-africa" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u class=" "&gt;endemic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in some of these creatures could be the cause of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;More definitive information comes from testing samples from affected patients, along with samples from their food, water, and environment. Although it’s unclear yet whether spillover caused the current outbreak, moments like this are reminders to Vora that the human threat to ecosystem health ultimately circles back to hurt us. Deforestation and conflict create more opportunities for people to interact with stressed, sickened animals, increasing the risk we’ll share their diseases.  “We live in an interconnected world,” says Vora. “The health of humans depends on the health of animals – and also, nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>National

class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases in the world. Infections kill one to three people for every 1,000 infected and can cause severe brain swelling, called encephalitis, in one in 1,000 cases. The disease also causes general misery, including a characteristic top-down rash, fever, runny nose, and red and watery eyes. The measles vaccine is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=Two%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine%20are%2097%25%20effective%20against%20measles,are%20eliminated%20from%20the%20body." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;97% effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;At least 146 people have been sickened in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, primarily in unvaccinated communities in the South Plains region. More than 20 people have been hospitalized, and an unvaccinated school-aged child died – the first American measles death since April 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy’s initially muted response to the outbreak has drawn intense criticism. Kennedy erroneously said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/kennedy-minimizes-measles-outbreak-wake-texas-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt; that the outbreak killed two people in Texas, and then, “it’s not unusual” to have outbreaks. In fact, measles sickened 285 people in the entirety of 2024. The Texas outbreak alone accounts for nearly half of last year’s total relatively early in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Over the weekend, Kennedy then penned an opinion piece in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; in which he argued vaccination was a “personal choice”, said vitamin A could “dramatically reduce measles mortality” and stopped short of explicitly recommending measles vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Good nutrition remains a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/features/micronutrient-facts.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;best defense&lt;/a&gt; against most chronic and infectious illnesses,” Kennedy wrote. “Vitamins A, C, and D, and foods rich in vitamins B12, C, and E should be part of a balanced diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Although studies have shown that vitamin A could be an effective supportive therapy for children already infected with measles, &lt;a href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=While%20no%20adverse%20events%20were,same%20benefit%20from%20vitamin%20A." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;most research&lt;/a&gt; has been conducted in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, where measles death rates and malnutrition are more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“It could lead to the impression of a false equivalency,” Dr Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and the co-director of Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told the Post. “To make the best decision for your children, you can either vaccinate or give vitamin A … That would be highly misleading.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Kennedy’s actions also sparked outrage from Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic Massachusetts senator who demanded Kennedy clarify his “intentions” for US vaccine policy in a Monday letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-12" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-rsfwa"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;This Week in Trumpland&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"the-stakes-us-election-edition","successDescription":"A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canadian researchers said switching from bottled to filtered tap water alone could slash their intake by 90 per cent — from roughly 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Brandon Luu, a resident physician in internal medicine at the University of Toronto and report co-author said today: 'Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90 per cent, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The report, published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml"&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, also said other 'significant' sources of microplastic intake included using plastic tea bags and how food is heated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Heating food in plastic containers — especially in the microwave — can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics,' Dr Luu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While these changes make sense, we still need research to confirm whether lowering intake leads to reduced accumulation in human tissues.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The earlier study, published last month in Nature Medicine, saw US scientists analyse the brain tissue of 52 people who died in 2016 and 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found the levels of microplastic found in people's brains was in 2024 was about 50 per cent higher than in those who died in 2016, suggesting the concentration in our bodies is rising as the environment becomes more polluted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Experts say you can cut your exposure to microplastics by swapping out plastics in your home for natural materials, metal and glass&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;span&gt;University of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-mexico/index.html" id="mol-cc2a2ae0-e23e-11ef-81c2-1faa0029a1c4" class=""&gt;New Mexico&lt;/a&gt; researchers also found higher amounts of tiny plastic particles in the brains of dementia patients who had died compared to those without the condition, suggesting a potential link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they noted that this didn't show that plastics harmed brain health. Instead, it merely hinted at a correlation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nicholas Fabiano, an expert in psychiatry at the University of Ottawa and lead author of the Brain Health commentary, said:&lt;span&gt; 'The dramatic increase in brain microplastic concentrations over just eight years, from 2016 to 2024, is particularly alarming.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This rise mirrors the exponential increase we're seeing in environmental microplastic levels.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To get into the brain, plastics have to cross the blood-brain barrier — a layer of cells surrounding the brain which acts as a filter to prevent the entry of harmful substances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics have worried scientists for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the long-term effects of microplastics on human health remain unclear concern is rising&lt;span&gt;  because avoiding them is almost impossible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study even found using a single tea bag could release &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14229649/Scientists-issue-urgent-warning-drinking-TEA-billions-dangerous-microplastics.html"&gt;billions of dangerous microplastics into the body&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microplastics have been found in variety of other human tissue including the intestines and even &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-13493443/scientists-microplastics-male-semen.html"&gt;in men's sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Luu also recommended that the public avoid using plastic containers while heating up food in a microwave. The cooking process can release 'substantial amounts' of plastics which contaminate your meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using glass and steel containers for food storage instead of plastic can also limit your exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the Mayo Clinic, dementia is the umbrella term for a group of symptoms which affects memory, thinking, and social behavior. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory loss is the most known symptom, but there are many others which can develop slowly over the course of several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include problems finding words and communicating with others, visual and spatial abilities like easily getting lost, confusion, and losing coordination of your movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There can also be a behavioral change, with dementia patients often experiencing depression, agitation, or unexplained outbursts of anger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization estimates that over 55 million people have dementia, with a half-million Americans expected to be diagnosed this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To this point, treatment has focused on maintaining a healthy lifestyle into old age, and the new study has added another step in that process - avoid plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Kennedy Jr.’s hesitant response to the Texas measles outbreak — hinting that vaccination is important, but never fully embracing it — has left many experts wondering: Does the nation's top health official support vaccines or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy, the Health and Human Services Secretary, wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;editorial published by Fox News on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine “is crucial to avoiding potentially deadly disease.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Behind the scenes, however, Kennedy, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-crisis-decades-making-rfk-jr-helped-drive-america-moment-rcna194093" target="_blank"&gt;a vocal, longtime vaccine skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, appears to be taking steps to minimizing the importance of vaccination. Under his leadership, two meetings to discuss next steps for vaccines were canceled. And he’s “collecting names of potential new members to put on a committee that recommends which vaccines Americans should get and when, according to people familiar with the matter,” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/rfk-jr-vaccine-hhs-agenda-bf7b9c07" target="_blank"&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; reported Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As of Tuesday, 158 measles cases had been confirmed in Texas, the state’s commissioner of the Department of State Health Services told state lawmakers Monday. Most of the sick people, including a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt;young child who died&lt;/a&gt;, hadn’t been vaccinated against the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy acknowledged in the editorial that measles — one of the most contagious viruses in the world — is especially risky to unvaccinated people. He stopped short of urging the public to get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” Kennedy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some pediatricians and public health experts have balked at the editorial, saying it was nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to comfort his anti-vaccine supporters amid backlash after &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt;he appeared to downplay the outbreak&lt;/a&gt; during a Cabinet meeting at the White House last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“While he kind of gives some lip service to the vaccines,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, “the fact that he used phrases like ‘personal’ choice is a wink and a nod to the anti-vaccine movement. They know he’s their man.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Molly O’Shea, a Michigan pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, said the fact that Kennedy didn’t fully back vaccines is “concerning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He certainly did not disparage vaccination in the way he worded it, but he did not come out with a strong statement of support for vaccination,” O’Shea said. “Vaccination is by far the most effective strategy at reducing morbidity and mortality from measles. That was not his go-to message.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a stark contrast in messaging from the previous Trump administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In 2019, when &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311" target="_blank"&gt;two measles outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; threatened to reverse the United States' status of having eliminated measles, then-HHS Secretary Alex Azar didn’t mince words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Measles vaccines are among the most extensively studied medical products we have, their safety has been firmly established over many years,” Azar said in an April 2019 &lt;a href="https://public3.pagefreezer.com/browse/HHS.gov/31-12-2020T08:51/https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/04/24/hhs-secretary-azar-statement-measles-outbreak-importance-vaccines.html" target="_blank"&gt;HHS statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;He went on to say that “measles is not a harmless childhood illness, but a highly contagious, potentially life-threatening disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the time, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/robert-f-kennedy-jr-speaking-at-albany-ny-rally-concerning-mandatory-vaccines-and-government-overreach/" target="_blank"&gt;told members of the Children’s Health Defense&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-vaccine nonprofit that he founded, that the MMR vaccine is worse “than the illness it’s pretending to prevent.” He didn't provide scientific evidence to back up the statement, flummoxing vaccine experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Vaccination is far and away the most effective means to protect individuals and their communities against measles,” said Dr. Ofer Levy, director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children’s Hospital. “If you want to get on top of this thing, that’s the answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for HHS didn't respond to questions about Kennedy’s editorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vitamin A theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy’s editorial doubled down on a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288" target="_blank"&gt;questionable treatment for measles: vitamin A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“CDC has &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html" target="_blank"&gt;recently updated their recommendation&lt;/a&gt; supporting administration of vitamin A under the supervision of a physician for those with mild, moderate, and severe infection,” he wrote, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s true that vitamin A is sometimes given to help treat measles in low-income countries where malnutrition is a factor, according to the World Health Organization. Most people in the U.S., however, have normal levels of the vitamin and don’t need any kind of vitamin A supplementation. Too much, experts say, is toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Vitamin A is fat-soluble, meaning it accumulates in the body rather than exiting through urination. That is, the more vitamin A you take, the more it accumulates in organs like the liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“You can easily overdose on vitamin A,” Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at both the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and the city’s Health Authority, said in an interview Friday. “It’s not to be used over the counter for anybody who says, ‘my kid has the sniffles. Maybe it’s measles.’ Don’t do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Anti-vaccine influencers and organizations have rallied around vitamin A as protection against and treatment for measles for years. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-vaccine-crisis-rcna187787" target="_blank"&gt;During outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, anti-vaccine groups have organized drives to fundraise and send vitamin A to affected communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Adalja of Johns Hopkins said Kennedy’s references to vitamin A only serve to discourage the MMR vaccine among his followers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“When RFK Jr. is talking about vitamin A, people are going to say, oh, that’s his code word that we should be doing that, not the MMR vaccine,” Adalja said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 16:11:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOU0Q4X1FnMklXZHJJLThlaERWSEFkWjctNENYVWRVaGZOcUtZOFFudEtPbW5UQjJNNmFkWkM5eUJGaTJQYW1yU2cyZm5YWjFkb3ZWUUI1Zk8zVjNEbHpQM3NBMnJEUVBBamZ0T0c4eS1UcXVEbElzNElIRXZnSjdfNlJwd2N5UzZZVTE5a3paUlE5QWFOMUw0WjdRSHIwRENtWGJfdTI2dm7SAVZBVV95cUxPZFI4M2s5cTV0c19QSHdCblNRRnJhYk41a25ISWpYeXU0UGhOWGhXZ0Fwd0t2ZDhoRlo2Nml1OEM3MmRlTk8zcnZTV0dQTkNqdDhzMmNHQQ</guid></item><item><title>Swearing is linked with increased pain tolerance and strength - Yahoo Life</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTkxTVlRmWVhKckJlRG9ZbWFXdXZKeUR3VXdJMXdlR1hPM01fWm1DTUVjcU1taVlEVEItdVZUQkp6TDRZXy1TeFhmNU5VMnpRbjNWejdJVExyNkVrMEFkUDlKc1JuT1pJeVlyUU9KY3diQTBNWjY3M3Z0UFJPaTVTUFZ2U2MteHJXTFFYakhEZU4?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you stub your toe or slam your finger in a door, there’s a good chance the first thing out of your mouth is a four-letter word.

With that knowledge, Stephens said, swearing can more effectively be used in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pain reduction through swearing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2009, Stephens and his colleagues published the first study linking swearing with hypoalgesia - a reduced sensitivity to pain. Subjects were asked to participate in a cold pressor task, in which they held their hands in ice water for as long as possible while repeating either a swear word of their choosing or a non-swear word. Swearing was associated with not only increased pain tolerance but also decreased perceived pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Studies followed showing similar, yet sometimes varied, effects. In 2020, for instance, Stephens and Robertson investigated the use of the swear “f---” compared with a neutral word and two made-up swear words - “fouch” and “twizpipe” - and found that swearing was linked with increased pain tolerance but had no significant effect on pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That association between swearing and increased pain tolerance is not specific to the English language. In 2017, Robertson and Stephens published a study investigating the cross-cultural effect of swearing on pain, comparing Japanese and English speakers. In Japan, Robertson said, swearing is not socially ingrained the way it is in Britain, so she doubted that it would have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While doing the cold presser task, native English speakers repeated either the swear “f---” or a control word - “cup” - and native Japanese speakers repeated a Japanese word that means s--- or a control word “kappu,” meaning cup. Regardless of language, swearing was linked with greater pain tolerance. “Which I wasn’t expecting at all, because I was expecting to see that social effect,” Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Swearing has benefits beyond physical pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In addition to pain tolerance, swearing has been linked to bolstered social bonds, improved memory, and even an alleviation of the social pain of exclusion or rejection. “Neurologically, the pathways for physical pain and emotional pain are the same,” Robertson said. “So when you have heartbreak, it’s the same neural structures. It’s the same biological blueprint, and that’s why it feels so visceral, because it literally is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More recently, swearing has been shown to be linked with an increase in strength. Looking at the impact of swearing on strength was a logical progression, Stephens said, because he and others had shown that swearing while in pain often was associated with increased heart rate, similar to what happens during a “fight or flight” stress response, where your body releases a surge of adrenaline and blood is diverted to your muscles to prepare for action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2018, Stephens and his colleagues found that, in an anaerobic power test on a bike, swearing was linked with an improvement in participant strength. However, they were unable to identify any physiological variable - including heart rate - that correlated with the finding. Stephens has since shifted his focus more to the psychological. “My research has been trying to understand what’s the psychological mechanism by which swearing brings about these effects, both for pain and for physical strength,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But what exactly connects swearing with greater strength and pain tolerance remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Over the past few years, Stephens has focused on state disinhibition theory: “the idea that, by swearing, we just get ourselves in a place where we’re more disinhibited, and in a disinhibited state, we push ourselves further, go for it a little bit more,” he said. “So we’ll put up with the ice-cold water for a few more seconds, or [in a strength task] we’ll squeeze on the hand gripper with a little more force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;- - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The optimal swearing dosage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Up until this point, testing the link between swearing and pain has been done in a controlled, laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nick Washmuth, professor of physical therapy at Samford University in Alabama, is focused on the potential for swearing to be used in a clinical context, which means understanding not only the mechanisms by which swearing affects pain but also how a person’s environment, age, how much they already swear in their everyday lives, the intensity of the swear word and other variables could influence the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We need to better understand those factors and how they play a role to be able to prescribe swearing in a medical sense, in a clinical sense,” Washmuth said. “Is there an optimal dosage for swearing?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For those who would like to use swearing to help with pain or increase strength, Washmuth suggested starting by selecting a swear word that feels powerful, that you would naturally use if you stubbed your toe, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If no word comes to mind, the f-word is the most commonly self-selected swear word by participants in these studies and is considered one of the most powerful swear words out there,” he said. “Swear at a steady pace once a second to once every three seconds, at a normal speech volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But if audible swearing is not your thing, do not despair. Washmuth is now studying whether internal swearing could do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Swearing out loud is frowned upon in many public places, right? So we’re trying to determine if you can swear using your inner monologue to get the same effect,” Washmuth said. “Can you swear in your head to decrease pain or improve strength?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/04/australia-chinese-electric-vehicles-byd/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Australia, with no auto industry to protect, is awash with Chinese EVs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Australia, with no auto industry to protect, is awash with Chinese EVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/04/panama-canal-trump-china/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:After Trump threats, Hong Kong firm to sell stake in Panama Canal ports;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;After Trump threats, Hong Kong firm to sell stake in Panama Canal ports &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/28/federal-workers-oklahoma-city-bombing/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Federal workers haunted by Oklahoma City bombing fear Trump’s barbs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Federal workers haunted by Oklahoma City bombing fear Trump’s barbs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Life</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:58:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQTkxTVlRmWVhKckJlRG9ZbWFXdXZKeUR3VXdJMXdlR1hPM01fWm1DTUVjcU1taVlEVEItdVZUQkp6TDRZXy1TeFhmNU5VMnpRbjNWejdJVExyNkVrMEFkUDlKc1JuT1pJeVlyUU9KY3diQTBNWjY3M3Z0UFJPaTVTUFZ2U2MteHJXTFFYakhEZU4</guid></item><item><title>Study Illuminates the Genetic Architecture of Bipolar Disorder - National Institute of Mental Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOeXBldi1oX1Q3MW1Gc05sSHZtUllpVG15eTdLcV9ySVF2Qmw5U09NcTJ5c1NBcHNRT0l1azhEeE9DZXJlNmp3ZHpEWUxBT1dyOTZfWlZkMWtjNVJYdk8zTGFzWWtLaUR5blBFNHpLUnR4Y3h2aE5zX05FQzlhTlQyNWxSX2wwR2R4cjRUMEQxQTVyaGRCdE1yRHJfQnRzUnJUV09kYWtIekE3clE3ZkJ4QnBOWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="main_content_inner"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bipolar disorder involves fluctuating periods of manic episodes (marked by extremely “up” or irritable moods) and depressive episodes (marked by very “down” moods or lack of pleasure). Although effective treatments are available, symptoms often return over time, and maintaining long-term treatment can be challenging. Evidence suggests a person’s risk for developing bipolar disorder is influenced by many genes, but open questions remain about the full range of genes involved and whether they differ for specific subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the researchers do in the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest genome-wide study of people with &lt;a href="/health/topics/bipolar-disorder" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="671a97d2-3609-4116-bd60-d2299e9333c4" data-entity-substitution="canonical"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; sheds new light on the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms involved in this common and often disabling mental illness. The findings from the study, funded by the National Institute of Health, may pave the way for more targeted and personalized treatments that could improve the lives of people with bipolar disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worldwide collaborative study was led by researchers in the Bipolar Disorder Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. The study included 158,036 people living with bipolar disorder and 2,796,499 people without the disorder across 79 clinical, community, and self-report cohorts—making it the largest such study to date. The participants were of European, East Asian, African American, and Latino ancestries, in contrast to previous studies conducted almost exclusively with people of European ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What did the results show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed an over four-fold increase in the number of genes associated with bipolar disorder, identifying nearly 300 gene locations and 36 unique genes most likely to be linked to the disorder. Many of these genes overlapped with those previously implicated in the risk for other mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also identified differences in the genetic architecture across bipolar disorder subtypes. The findings suggest that genetics play a key role across a broad spectrum of conditions that fall under the umbrella of bipolar disorder. These range from less common but more severe conditions that lead people to seek psychiatric care to conditions that are less disabling but more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next big challenge for the field is to understand why bipolar disorder varies so much from person to person and the degree to which genetic factors can explain individual variation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reference&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Connell, K.

The study found that nearly 14% of adults between the ages of 18 and 64 reported a past diagnosis, a figure substantially higher than estimates from just over a decade ago. Researchers also uncovered notable differences in diagnosis rates across various demographic groups, including sex, age, race, education level, and where people live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, researchers have suspected that the number of adults diagnosed with ADHD has been climbing. However, solid data on this trend has been lacking. While studies have examined ADHD prevalence in adults using older data or data from other countries, up-to-date, nationally representative information for working-age adults in the U.S. has been scarce. It’s important to focus on this age group because ADHD can significantly affect many aspects of their lives, such as job performance, financial stability, relationships, overall health, and even risky behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this knowledge gap, researchers turned to a newly available resource: the 2023 National Wellbeing Survey. This survey offered a unique opportunity to get a current snapshot of self-reported ADHD diagnoses in this population. Around the time this study was being prepared for publication, another research group released similar estimates using a different data source. This led the researchers to compare their findings with these new estimates to provide a more complete picture of the current situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were several reasons to believe that the percentage of working-age adults who have been diagnosed with ADHD by a health care provider has increased over time. However, there is limited population-representative data to test that idea,” said study author Andrew S. London, associate dean for Maxwell Programs in DC and professor of sociology at Syracuse University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the time we began this paper, we believed &lt;a href="https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/research/lerner-center/health-research/national-wellbeing-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the National Wellbeing Survey&lt;/a&gt; was the only recent national data set that would allow such estimates to be made. While the paper was in review, another set of estimates became available. Hence, at the Editor’s and Reviewers’ suggestion, we spent considerable time in this paper talking about similarities and differences in the estimates obtained from the two studies. This research fills a major gap in the literature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 National Wellbeing Survey included responses from 7,053 working-age adults across the United States. This survey is conducted online annually and aims to represent the non-institutionalized adult population between 18 and 64 years old who can read English. Participants are recruited from online panels managed by a company called Qualtrics Panels. For the 2023 survey, a large number of panel members were contacted, and nearly 15,000 completed the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the quality of the data, responses were checked for issues like rushing through the survey or giving the same answer repeatedly, and some responses were removed from the final dataset due to quality concerns. While online surveys often have lower response rates than traditional mail or phone surveys, the response rate for this survey was comparable to other national online surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the survey, participants were asked if a healthcare professional had ever told them they had any of a list of medical conditions, including “ADHD or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).” The researchers then analyzed the percentage of people who answered “yes” to this question. They looked at the overall percentage and also broke it down by different demographic characteristics such as sex (male or female), age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-64 years), race and ethnicity (White, Black/African American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and other/multiple race), whether they were born in the U.S. or not, education level (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, bachelor’s degree or higher), and urban or rural residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure the survey results accurately reflected the U.S. working-age population, the researchers used statistical weights. These weights adjusted the sample to match the known demographics of this population in terms of sex, age, race, education, and urban/rural location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers noticed that the survey sample initially appeared less healthy than what is typically seen in national health surveys. Because health status can be related to ADHD, they made an additional adjustment to the weights to ensure the sample’s health profile was more in line with national averages, specifically matching the self-rated health distribution from the 2023 National Health Interview Survey. They then calculated the percentages of self-reported ADHD diagnoses using both the original weights and these adjusted weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s primary finding was that 13.9% of working-age adults in the U.S. reported having ever received an ADHD diagnosis from a healthcare professional. This number is considerably higher than a 2012 estimate of 4.25% for a similar population and also higher than a recent estimate of 7.8% for all adults aged 18 and older in 2023 from the other study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was somewhat surprising that the levels were as high as they were,” London told PsyPost. “That said, they seem consistent with rates of diagnosis in childhood plus the growth in new adult diagnoses. Thus, they seem plausible. The increase over time may reflect changes in diagnostic criteria for children and adults, greater acceptance of adult diagnosis, over- and mis-diagnosis, and methodological issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that diagnosis rates varied across all the demographic factors they examined. Women were more likely to report a diagnosis than men, although the difference was relatively small. Younger adults had much higher rates of diagnosis compared to older adults, with the highest rates in the 18-29 age group and the lowest in the 50-64 group. Non-Hispanic White adults had higher rates than other racial and ethnic groups. U.S.-born adults reported diagnoses more frequently than those born outside the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals with less education were more likely to report an ADHD diagnosis than those with higher education levels. Finally, people living in mid-sized metropolitan areas (with populations between 250,000 and 1 million) had the highest rates, compared to those in the largest metropolitan areas (over 1 million population).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put their findings in perspective, the researchers also analyzed data from the 2023 National Center for Health Statistics Rapid Surveys System, the same data source used in the other recent study. Using this dataset and focusing on working-age adults, they estimated a slightly lower prevalence of 9.6%. While this is still a substantial figure and higher than previous estimates, it is lower than the 13.9% found in the National Wellbeing Survey. The researchers point out that the difference might be due to variations in the specific online panels used for each survey, subtle differences in survey methods, and how quality control was handled in each study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that their study has some limitations. The National Wellbeing Survey, even with adjustments, may not perfectly represent the overall health of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sample was drawn from an online panel and weighted to make it demographically representative of the population,” London noted. “We also adjusted the weight to enhance sample generalizability. There are better methodologies—gold-standard methodologies—for drawing probability samples of populations. Such samples are better for generalizing results to the population level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we have confidence in our estimates, we would like to see surveys that use the gold-standard sampling approach collect data on lifetime and current ADHD, as well as symptoms. This would allow for potentially more-precise estimates, validation of our estimates, and research on factors that are associated with ADHD. We are doing some of the work on factors association with ADHD now with the National Wellbeing Survey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, this study offers valuable, up-to-date estimates of self-reported ADHD diagnoses among working-age adults in the U.S. These findings highlight a potential increase in diagnoses and significant demographic variations. The researchers hope their work will encourage further research to confirm these trends and better understand the reasons behind them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to contribute current research on adult ADHD and its consequences across a range of life-course domains—health, substance use, marriage/family outcomes, etc,” London said. “The National Wellbeing Survey allows for that in a way that no other national, population-representative survey does. We hope this research will raise awareness, stimulate more data collection, and encourage others to do research in this area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251319861" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Self-Reported ADHD Diagnosis Status Among Working-Age Adults in the United States: Evidence From the 2023 National Wellbeing Survey&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Andrew S.

&lt;p&gt;During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, the First Lady and I offer our heartfelt prayers to every American battling the horrific disease of colorectal cancer, as well as their families, friends, and loved ones.  In honor of those we have lost to this colorectal cancer, my Administration is strongly committed to ending our Nation’s chronic disease epidemic and making America healthy again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every year, 150,000 Americans are diagnosed with—and 50,000 die from—colorectal cancer making it the leading cause of cancer death among Americans aged 18 to 49.  Citizens with inflammatory bowel disease or a personal or family history of the disease face a heightened risk and should talk to their doctor about new advancements in cancer screening.  Regular screening is recommended beginning at age 45 as it has been shown that early detection of cancer may result in more effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cancer is a devastating disease, but there is reason for hope.  Since 1975, medical advancements have saved an estimated 940,000 Americans from colorectal cancer thanks to the incredible efforts of our exceptional American doctors and researchers.  By improving prevention and screening processes we have given our people more precious moments with those they hold dear. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The United States is at the forefront of medical technology—and recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first blood test for people at average risk for colon cancer.  This advancement is another tool in the toolbox, including the colonoscopy and stool DNA tests—giving citizens the ability to choose the option that works best for them in consultation with their doctor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My Administration commits to lowering cancer rates and conquering chronic illness, which will create a Nation and a world free of cancer.  We solemnly stand beside those who have lost their loved ones to this dreadful disease—and we pray that God provides courage and strength to those still fighting it, and to all those who are touched by its effects.  As my Administration continues to push the boundaries of medical innovation, we pledge to build a brighter, healthier future for all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two cases of measles have been confirmed in New York City as of the end of February, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New York City Health Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Officials didn’t disclose the ages or vaccination status of the two cases, but they are &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuXleWGn7kE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;urging parents&lt;/a&gt; to vaccinate their children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The news comes as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/02/us-news/measles-alert-issued-in-new-jersey-county-following-three-confirmed-cases/"&gt;New Jersey has issued a measles alert&lt;/a&gt; in response to three confirmed cases in Bergen County.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;New York City has confirmed two measles cases as of the end of February. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to NYC’s health department, the two cases are unrelated, with one occurring earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For each case, our agency conducts routine case and contact investigation and we ensure proper follow-ups for exposed persons.” acting commissioner of the NYC Health Department Dr. Michelle Morse told &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/03/03/measles-new-york-city/81204974007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The city had 14 cases in 2024, making up nearly all of New York State’s 15 total cases. The rest of New York State has no confirmed cases yet this year.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Measles were declared officially eliminated in the US in 2000, but cases have been on the rise in recent years. According to the CDC, there have been 164 cases across the US as of Feb. 27, spreading across Alaska, California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, Rhode Island and Texas. Twenty percent of those cases have resulted in hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Texas has had the biggest outbreak with 146 cases, and last week reported the country’s &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/28/us-news/texas-measles-cases-rise-to-146-in-an-outbreak-that-led-to-a-childs-death/"&gt;first measles death&lt;/a&gt; since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Measles, also called rubeola, shows no symptoms for the first 10 to 14 days after infection. Those who are infected then typically experience cough, sore throat, runny nose, pink eye, white spots inside the mouth, a blotchy skin rash and fever, which can rise as high as 104 to 105.8 F.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Public health officials are urging people to vaccinate their children after the US recorded its first measles death since 2015. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;It’s also highly contagious — people with measles can spread it for several days before the rash even appears. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the New York City Health Department. if a person has measles, 90% of those around them who are not vaccinated or immune through previous infection will get it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health officials have urged usage of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as individual protection against the virus and to promote herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a pediatrician and the State’s doctor, I want to remind everyone that immunization is safe and the best protection for your children against measles and other potentially deadly diseases,” State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said in a PSA. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a very contagious, serious respiratory disease that causes rash and fever. In some cases, measles can reduce the immune system’s ability to fight other infections like pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The city had 14 cases in 2024, making up nearly all of New York State’s 15 total cases.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;REUTERS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I encourage anyone not vaccinated against measles to receive at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and get their children vaccinated with two doses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Morse added to &lt;a href="https://pix11.com/news/local-news/new-york-city-reports-measles-cases-raising-public-health-concern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PIX11&lt;/a&gt;: “If you get the vaccine, the risk for measles for you is incredibly small, it leads to 97% coverage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While it’s very rare to get measles if you’re fully vaccinated, breakthrough infections do happen, with the CDC noting that they make up about 5% of total infections.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are common in places where there in an outbreak, meaning there are more people with the virus, increasing potential exposure.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/us-news/rfk-jr-calls-for-new-age-of-radical-transparency-at-hhs-tells-critics-they-can-retire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt; — who has been outspoken in his vaccine skepticism — promoted the measles jab &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us?title=op-ed%20for%20Fox%20News" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;in a Fox News Digital op-ed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness with certain health risks, especially to unvaccinated individuals,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Prior to the introduction of the vaccine in the 1960s, virtually every child in the United States contracted measles,” he went on, pointing to a fatality rate of 1 in 1,205 cases from 1953 to 1962.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

	New cases of the &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/measles/" id="auto-tag_measles" data-tag="measles"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; have been reported in New York City and New Jersey as an &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-measles-outbreak-texas-vaccines-1235281134/"&gt;outbreak in Texas&lt;/a&gt; — which has already &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/child-dies-measles-outbreak-west-texas-1235280838/"&gt;led to one child’s death&lt;/a&gt; — continues, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/03/03/measles-new-york-city/81204974007/"&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The New York Department of Health said two cases have been reported in NYC, though so far, none have cropped up in the rest of the state. Across the river in New Jersey, three cases have been reported, according to that state’s department of health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The first case in NYC was reported earlier this year, and the new one appears to be unrelated (there were 14 measles cases reported in the city in 2024). In a &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/2025-02-27_measles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, New York State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said, “As a pediatrician and the State’s doctor, I want to remind everyone that immunization is safe and the best protection for your children against measles and other potentially deadly diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The NJ Department of Health &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.nj.gov/health/cd/topics/measles.shtml"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a similar call for vaccinations, saying that all three cases of measles in the state have been found in people who are unvaccinated. 

	&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Last week, a school-aged child died from measles in West Texas, marking the first reported measles death in the United States in a decade. The child, who died after being hospitalized the previous week, was not vaccinated, the Texas Department of State Health Services confirmed.

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	The outbreak in West Texas has spread rapidly across nine counties, with 146 cases identified since late January. It’s the worst measles outbreak in Texas in more than 30 years. The majority of the cases have emerged from Mennonite communities, where many children are “undervaccinated,” a state health department spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-line-height-copy  lrv-a-font-body-l   "&gt;
	Last week, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. downplayed the severity of the outbreak, saying, “It’s not unusual to have measles outbreaks every year.” Kennedy, a &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-jr-tried-kill-covid-vaccine-1235240065/"&gt;known vaccine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/fda-cancels-flu-vaccine-meeting-rfk-jr-hhs-1235281638/"&gt;skeptic&lt;/a&gt;, has since published an &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; telling parents to consider vaccines without suggesting or recommending them outright. &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Many Americans remain unaware of the cancer risk for both men and women posed by human papillomavirus (HPV), a new Ohio State University poll has found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people don’t know much about &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/public-health/hpv-and-genital-warts-647278.html"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt; and its long-term cancer risks, and also have key misperceptions about how the virus is spread, the poll found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the majority of people are unaware that the virus is more common among men than women, and is associated with rising rates of cancers that directly impact men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, people still see HPV as mostly associated with &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/women-health/cervical-cancer-2665820966.html"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt; risk in women, and shrug off the importance of vaccination for men, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of awareness might explain why HPV vaccination rates have been slow to increase, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a vaccine that has been shown to reduce the risk of HPV infection by up to 90%,” &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-researcher/search-researcher-directory/electra-d-paskett"&gt;Electra Paskett&lt;/a&gt;, a cancer control researcher with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a powerful tool for cancer prevention that has only been available to us in the past few decades, and we are seeing the impact of those vaccines now through the scientific data,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The federal Healthy People 2030 goals call for at least 80% of teens to be vaccinated against HPV by the end of the decade, according to the &lt;a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/prevention/hpv_immunization"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But only about 57% of boys and 61% of girls have gotten the HPV vaccine, the NCI says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the survey, Ohio State researchers asked people if they agree or disagree with basic statements about HPV. Responses showed an astonishing lack of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, about 42% of people believe HPV is more common in women than in men, the poll found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is concerning because more men are infected with HPV than women and they could unknowingly spread it to their partners,” Paskett said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, nearly half of respondents (45%) didn’t know that HPV is linked to cancers other than cervical cancer in women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, HPV does cause more than 9 out of every 10 cases of cervical cancer, but the virus also causes cancers of the penis, anus, head and neck among men, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/cancers-caused-by-hpv.html"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 4 out of every 10 cases of cancer caused by HPV occur among men, the CDC says. Every year, more than 15,000 American men develop cancers caused by HPV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also have been rapidly rising rates of HPV-related tonsil and tongue base cancers, noted &lt;a href="https://cancer.osu.edu/find-a-doctor/search-physician-directory/matthew-o-old"&gt;Dr. Matthew Old&lt;/a&gt;, a head and neck surgeon with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cancers could become one of the top three cancers among middle-aged U.S. men 45 to 65 by 2045, and the most common cancer in elderly men in the next 10 years, recent estimates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new survey, 40% of poll respondents believed that people with HPV have symptoms. In truth, HPV infections are largely silent for years, with symptoms developing only after the virus has caused cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It can take years or even decades for the genetic changes caused by HPV to take effect and transform into cancer,” Old said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CDC stats show that the vaccine has been effective in cutting down on HPV since its approval for girls in 2006 and subsequent approval for boys in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infections with the HPV strains that cause most cancers have dropped 88% among teen girls and 81% among young adult women, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccination-impact/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HPV is sexually transmitted, and once someone is infected there are no drugs that will rid them of the virus, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HPV vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/gardasil.html"&gt;Gardasil 9&lt;/a&gt;, is recommended between ages 9 and 12 for maximum effectiveness, prior to potential exposure, Paskett said. However, she added that the vaccine also is now available to adults up to age 45.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many who are unvaccinated unknowingly carry and spread high-risk strains of the virus,” Old said. “That’s why vaccination is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;

This unique form of art is not just an ancient tribal tradition but a popular contemporary mode of self-expression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the potential health risks associated with the injected tattoo ink have largely been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are now investigating the long-term effects of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tattoos-increase-the-risk-of-developing-lymphoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;tattoo&lt;/a&gt; ink within the body and whether it could contribute to health issues, including cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tattoo-ink-s-journey-in-the-body"&gt;Tattoo ink’s journey in the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the tattoo artist punches the ink into the skin, your body identifies the pigments as foreign substances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/tattoos-and-body-art-found-on-1200-year-old-peruvian-mummies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ink&lt;/a&gt; stays in the skin, making the tattoo permanent, but some travels in the blood and collects in the lymph nodes, which help protect the body from illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts are concerned that tattoo ink in the lymph nodes might cause long-term swelling and possibly lead to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tattoo-ink-and-health-concerns"&gt;Tattoo ink and health concerns&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study from the University of Southern Denmark (&lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SDU&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Helsinki&lt;/a&gt; suggests that tattoo ink may compromise the immune system’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the lymphatic system plays a pivotal role in the immune response, any disruption caused by foreign substances could have long-term consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henrik Frederiksen is a consultant in haematology at Odense University Hospital (&lt;a href="https://en.ouh.dk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;OUH&lt;/a&gt;) and a clinical professor at SDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can see that ink particles accumulate in the lymph nodes, and we suspect that the body perceives them as foreign substances,“ noted Fredericksen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may mean that the immune system is constantly trying to respond to the ink, and we do not yet know whether this persistent strain could weaken the function of the lymph nodes or have other health &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/cancer-cells-collaborate-to-survive-challenging-conditions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;consequences&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists worry that if the immune system keeps fighting ink particles, it might cause unusual cell growth, which can lead to cancer. But since cancer develops slowly, it’s hard to know the true effect of tattoos on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connection-between-tattoos-and-cancer"&gt;Connection between tattoos and cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the long-term effects of tattoos requires extensive data spanning considerable time periods. Scientists at SDU have found a solution by exploiting data from the Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort, encompassing over 5,900 Danish twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By observing tattoo patterns and corresponding cancer diagnoses, they concluded that tattooed individuals had higher skin and lymphoma cancer rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides us with a stronger method for investigating whether tattoos themselves may influence cancer risk,” said Jacob von Bornemann Hjelmborg, professor of biostatistics at SDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-influence-of-tattoo-size"&gt;Influence of tattoo size&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study further unveiled that tattoo size matters. Large tattoos showed a stronger link to cancer risk than smaller ones. Concerning lymphoma, people with large tattoos had a nearly three times higher &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/our-lifetime-cancer-risk-may-be-established-before-we-are-born/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;occurrence rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that the bigger the tattoo and the longer it has been there, the more ink accumulates in the lymph nodes,” said Signe Bedsted Clemmensen, assistant professor of biostatistics at SDU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”The extent of the impact on the immune system should be further investigated so that we can better understand the mechanisms at play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tattoos-remain-fashionable"&gt;Tattoos remain fashionable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite health concerns, the popularity of tattoos continues to rise. The Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort study revealed that nearly 40% of women and 30% of men will have tattoos by age 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trend is a global phenomenon, with increasing social acceptance of tattoos, particularly among youths and women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-does-tattoo-ink-color-matter"&gt;Does tattoo ink color matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety of tattoos also hinges on the composition of the ink. Various pigments contain different chemicals, potentially harmful when absorbed into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the current research doesn’t identify specific ink colors as direct cancer causes, future research may examine this aspect further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-of-tattoo-research"&gt;Future of tattoo research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are shifting focus to understand how ink particles interact with the body on a molecular level. They aim to determine whether certain types of lymphoma are more strongly linked to tattoos and how long-term exposure to ink affects immune system function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to gain a better understanding of the biological mechanisms – what happens in the lymph nodes when they are exposed to ink particles over decades? This can help us assess whether there is a real health risk and what we might do to reduce it,” concluded Clemmensen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the potential health risks associated with tattoos is thus paramount for informed decisions regarding tattoos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ongoing-research-efforts"&gt;Ongoing research efforts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Danish Twin Tattoo Cohort is a research project designed to study whether tattoos could be linked to cancer. Scientists want to understand if tattoos increase &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/breakthrough-discovery-about-cell-migration-will-help-defeat-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health risks&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s tricky because people have different genetics and lifestyles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study compares twins – who share the same genes but may have different tattoo habits. By doing this, researchers can see if tattoos alone have any health effects or if other factors, like family history or environment, play a bigger role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a government agency in Denmark estimated that 14% of the population had tattoos. By 2021, tattoos had become even more popular, with 30-40% of people under 35 having at least one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more people get tattoos, scientists want to learn whether ink inside the body has any long-term health effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, tattoos are not just designs on the skin. When ink is injected, it stays in the body, and some of it may move to other areas. Scientists are still figuring out if this could lead to serious health problems like cancer. Until more research is done, it’s important to stay informed and understand the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-025-21413-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMC Public Health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 13:30:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNY0c4eF9RbG8tX3ppUGwyRVRjaEZRS200UDkxdFJsRGwxdGU3QzJrZERNXzNkSlhlSkFlUXdVWkd4d3NLRkhJRGkwVTZPZDNTSFlVUThIa3FDWFNKazJ6dVE1el9kTHhOd01LR1dEZzgtMVJzeWdaSWdEZGlmMmxRNkY0UzN3MUU3Y2xjc3hhbmtaUG16NWF3cw</guid></item><item><title>Developing resilience in the face of the ‘MonSter’ that’s MS - Multiple Sclerosis News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxORDNOWFNQQ0N0TnFQZk1aOU9EaFo1aVVRaG1wa2xIbFF2N3lyQ1hjRDFtUTRibmt3dEdfWmdDaVZKRTFhVDZzUlpDVmZlOWtOSXAxSW8xNllZRWdSRGxoS1NRV19Ud200WlhFMVN2MkExckNlT3FWQUowd3d1U3ROQzdjR1VEMk9qY2d0dlcySzI3Qm5OSHNIWmktendrNHVqUUxkcmFR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 4 of 31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Melinda Livermont’s story:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the initial &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/"&gt;MRI scans&lt;/a&gt;, spinal tap, and blood work, hearing the actual words from the doctor — “You have &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/next-steps-after-ms-diagnosis/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” (MS) — is a distinct shock that every person &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-diagnosis/"&gt;diagnosed with MS&lt;/a&gt; must face. It feels like losing a battle. Yet, amid the fear and confusion, there comes a moment for standing up and proclaiming inside oneself: “This too is worth every ounce of the fight.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up each day more exhausted than the day before, without any chance of knowing what a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2022/10/12/expert-voices-sleep-well-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;restful night of sleep&lt;/a&gt; feels like, became my reality. But losing half my &lt;a href="http://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-symptoms/vision-problems-in-ms/"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; completely from the nose down, due to a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesion&lt;/a&gt; on my optic nerve, allowed me to refocus on the beauty in life and people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/expert-voices/2022/06/15/expert-voices-pain-management-people-with-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;Constant pain&lt;/a&gt; from head to toe has become my normal. When a new “ouch” emerges, it’s almost a blessing — a signal from my body alerting me to something new that needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking has become a challenge I’ve learned to adapt to with the help of science. What I call my bionic sleeve — an electrode-fitted device — sends the right signals from my brain to my nerves, enabling me to walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful that I fall less often now than I did before. Each small victory, like showing my physical therapist a new skill I’ve mastered, fills me with pride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;my MS journey&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve come to accept that change is constant. Life can shift dramatically in the blink of an eye. I don’t appreciate the disease — I’ve dubbed it the MonSter — that is MS, or the diagnosis I received in 2018. But I deeply value the resilience it has taught me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day, I show up for the fight, no matter what MS chooses to throw at me. One thing is certain: I will never back down!&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vaccine to prevent breast cancer is showing good results, and moving into the next stage of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This vaccine is designed eventually to prevent breast cancer,” said Amit Kumar, CEO of&lt;a href="https://www.anixa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Anixa Biosciences&lt;/a&gt;. “So, one day, we hope to be able to give it to pretty much every woman in the world who’s worried about breast cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anixa is developing the vaccine, which is entering phase two of a clinical trial at the&lt;a href="https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2024/11/08/cleveland-clinic-announces-updated-findings-in-preventive-breast-cancer-vaccine-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/2024/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society facts and figures for 2024-2025&lt;/a&gt;, approximately 1 in 8 women (13%) will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and 1 in 43 (2.3%) will die from the disease. An additional 2,790 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer, and 530 are expected to die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This trial is initially focused on the most lethal form of breast cancer, which is known as triple-negative breast cancer,” Kumar told WTOP. “But we anticipate that it’ll work for other types of breast cancer as well.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The vaccine targets a lactation protein, alpha-lactalbumin, which is not found after lactation in normal aging breast tissues but is present in most triple-negative breast cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer begins with a single cell, then doubles to two, then four, then eight, cells — eventually becoming a multibillion cell tumor that can be seen on a mammogram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If [the vaccine] has properly trained in that patient’s immune system, at the 2-cell, 4-cell or 8-cell stage, the immune system will destroy those cells, and so they never have a chance to become a tumor,” said Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;How the breast cancer vaccine has been tested so far&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the phase one trial, a group of 26 patients was broken down into three categories, said Kumar. In this phase, researchers are studying whether the drug is effective and safe and identifying the optimal dosage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group A was made up of women already diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer — an aggressive form that is notoriously difficult to treat. These patients have already gone through treatment — including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation — and are currently cancer-free, but at high risk for recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Anywhere from 40% to 80% of these women will have a recurrence within 5 years,” said Kumar. “So we’re giving them the vaccine to see if we can teach their immune systems to target the cancer, if and when it returns.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Group B is made up of patients who are cancer-free, but at high genetic risk, and have elected to voluntarily have a preventative mastectomy to lower their risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to vaccinate these women before their surgeries, and after their surgery we’re going to be able to examine their purportedly healthy tissue,” said Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third cohort, Group C, are patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer who received chemotherapy and surgery, and are being treated with immunotherapy. Liquid biopsy shows these patients have traces of cancer remaining in their blood, which puts them at high risk for developing another tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to give these women the vaccine in addition to existing standard of care therapy, to see if the vaccine can act synergistically and prevent their cancers from coming back,” Kumar said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results have been promising, and the side effects minimal, said Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Over three-quarters of these women are showing a good, robust immune response, and others are showing a modest immune response,” he said. “The only side effect these women felt was irritation at the site of injection, so no headaches, no pain, no abnormal laboratory values.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;What’s next in the clinical trial&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In phase two — the larger part of the study — Kumar said they’ll be treating women who have just recently been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, and are heading toward surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Typically, standard of care is to give these women chemotherapy in what’s known as the ‘neoadjuvant setting,’ which is before surgery,” said Kumar. “The intent is to reduce their tumor burden, so perhaps surgery can be less aggressive and also to lessen the chance of a recurrence after the surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of the women in phase two of the study will get that current standard-of-care treatment. The other half will receive standard-of-care treatment and also get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re hoping that the vaccine group fares much better than the standard of care group, which is what we expect,” said Kumar. “The question is, will it be 60% effective, 80% effective, or is it 100% effective? — which is what we saw in the animal studies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, an even-larger phase three trial would have half the number of patients receiving the vaccine, the other half getting a placebo, in addition to standard of care treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kumar said the plan is for the vaccine to come to market in stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The first will be for women battling breast cancer, the second will be for patients who have already had breast cancer and worry about it returning. And the third will be women who have never had breast cancer, to prevent breast cancer in the future,” said Kumar. “We believe that the first application, for women who are battling breast cancer, could be available within four to five years.”&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;Continuous blood glucose monitors have been promoted as potentially life-changing for people with &lt;a href="https://www.healthday.com/a-to-z-health/diabetes/diabetes-overview"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; — allowing real-time updates on blood sugar levels without the need for repeated finger pricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a new small-scale study suggests these devices might not be as accurate as many believe, and could lead some to mismanage their diets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) appear to overestimate blood sugar levels in healthy adults, according to findings published recently in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(25)00092-9/fulltext"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monitors consistently reported elevated blood sugar levels two to four times more often than finger prick tests, which are the gold standard for blood glucose testing, researchers report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“CGMs are fantastic tools for people with diabetes because even if a measurement isn’t perfectly accurate, it's still better than not having a measurement at all. However, for someone with good glucose control they can be misleading based on their current performance,” senior researcher &lt;a href="https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/persons/javier-gonzalez"&gt;Javier Gonzalez&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of health with the University of Bath in the U.K., said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For healthy individuals, relying on CGMs could lead to unnecessary food restrictions or poor dietary choices,” he added. “If you want to assess your blood sugar accurately, traditional methods are still the way to go."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous glucose monitors were originally designed to help diabetics manage their blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the devices now are being used by health-conscious folks to help them track how different foods affect blood sugar levels, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The monitors track blood sugar levels via a patch slapped onto a person’s arm, and transmit the data to a smartphone, smart watch or other wearable device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers tracked blood sugar levels in 15 healthy volunteers after they drank or ate various fruit-based products, ranging from whole fruit to fruit smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CGMs overestimated the glycemic index hit from a fruit smoothie by 30%, reporting a medium GI of 69 compared to the low GI of 53 shown in a finger prick test, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole fruits also tended to be misclassified as medium- or high-GI foods by the monitors, while finger prick testing showed they were low GI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could lead people to avoid whole fruits, in the mistaken belief that they might cause spikes in blood sugar, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, monitors overestimated people’s time spent above healthy blood sugar levels by nearly 400%, results show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for other factors, the monitors still overestimated time above healthy blood sugar levels by about two-fold, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"CGMs may be inaccurate because they measure glucose in the fluid surrounding your cells, not directly in your blood,” Gonzalez concluded. “This can lead to discrepancies due to factors like time delays, blood flow, and how glucose moves between different parts of the body.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by &lt;a href="https://www.innocentdrinks.co.uk/home"&gt;innocent drinks&lt;/a&gt;, a U.K.-based maker of smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But although &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165017399000600?via=ihub"&gt;swearing&lt;/a&gt; is a near-universal feature of language, it is still considered taboo by many.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5VK6DRZEPBG7JIDXZIIVDGU7HA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/team/olly-robertson"&gt;Olly Robertson&lt;/a&gt; is not one of them. “It’s something that we all share, and it is really magical. It holds so much power over us as societies,” said Robertson, a psychology researcher at the University of Oxford. “It does something for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="W2GO7YVZMNDRPA7SAACWWZP2BM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One of those things is an increase in pain tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ICEPLB67QVFHNLLJB3Q2YRMJNM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Swearing is “a drug-free, calorie-neutral, cost-free means of self-help,” said &lt;a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/people/richardstephens/"&gt;Richard Stephens&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher and senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2PB7GP3DLZE6HO5QIW3W7NZA4U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers are working to understand the mechanisms underlying swearing’s impact in a number of circumstances, with a major focus on pain. With that knowledge, Stephens said, swearing can more effectively be used in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="OCOKSUCSHRA6XBZVO3R5DXI7MM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="OCOKSUCSHRA6XBZVO3R5DXI7MM"&gt;Pain reduction through swearing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IUL72LAJANDNNIBG3H6IYSO3YE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2009, Stephens and his colleagues published the first &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/abstract/2009/08050/swearing_as_a_response_to_pain.4.aspx"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; linking swearing with hypoalgesia — a reduced sensitivity to pain. Subjects were asked to participate in a cold pressor task, in which they held their hands in ice water for as long as possible while repeating either a swear word of their choosing or a non-swear word. Swearing was associated with not only increased pain tolerance but also decreased perceived pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="67JQJZSGVFF3ZCATHY5K45UXWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Studies followed showing similar, yet sometimes varied, effects. In 2020, for instance, Stephens and Robertson &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00723/full"&gt;investigated&lt;/a&gt; the use of the swear “f---” compared with a neutral word and two made-up swear words — “fouch” and “twizpipe” — and found that swearing was linked with increased pain tolerance but had no significant effect on pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXVVAG2D7FFZRL7RDJKYT2SIQQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;That association between swearing and increased pain tolerance is not specific to the English language. In 2017, Robertson and Stephens published a &lt;a href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1016/j.sjpain.2017.07.014/html"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating the cross-cultural effect of swearing on pain, comparing Japanese and English speakers. In Japan, Robertson said, swearing is not socially ingrained the way it is in Britain, so she doubted that it would have the same effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MD2TFJHQ3NAFLEVZNWHD7OHT7A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While doing the cold presser task, native English speakers repeated either the swear “f---” or a control word — “cup” — and native Japanese speakers repeated a Japanese word that means s--- or a control word “kappu,” meaning cup. Regardless of language, swearing was linked with greater pain tolerance. “Which I wasn’t expecting at all, because I was expecting to see that social effect,” Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="LNYTCCNDWZCV5DDJS6DHTFRX2U" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="LNYTCCNDWZCV5DDJS6DHTFRX2U"&gt;Swearing has benefits beyond physical pain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LCULTTNCTVD7NAWTDBUOZTPDXE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In addition to pain tolerance, swearing has been linked to bolstered &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216604000396?via=ihub"&gt;social bonds&lt;/a&gt;, improved &lt;a href="https://scholarlypublishingcollective.org/uip/ajp/article-abstract/121/1/83/258589/Recalling-Taboo-and-Nontaboo-Words?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, and even an alleviation of the social pain of &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2264"&gt;exclusion&lt;/a&gt; or rejection. “Neurologically, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4869967/"&gt;pathways&lt;/a&gt; for physical pain and emotional pain are the same,” Robertson said. “So when you have heartbreak, it’s the same neural structures. It’s the same biological blueprint, and that’s why it feels so visceral, because it literally is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y5HRXOXP35FBRLKHXY4JWXWAEQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More recently, swearing has been shown to be linked with an &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1469029216301352" target="_blank"&gt;increase in strength&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the impact of swearing on strength was a logical progression, Stephens said, because he and others had shown that swearing while in pain often was associated with increased heart rate, similar to what happens during a “fight or flight” &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541120/"&gt;stress response&lt;/a&gt;, where your body releases a surge of adrenaline and blood is diverted to your muscles to prepare for action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AOH2RPGP25DYFELOQKASJF6Y2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In 2018, Stephens and his colleagues found that, in an anaerobic power test on a bike, swearing was linked with an improvement in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1469029216301352" target="_blank"&gt;participant strength&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were unable to identify any physiological variable — including heart rate — that correlated with the finding. Stephens has since shifted his focus more to the psychological. “My research has been trying to understand what’s the psychological mechanism by which swearing brings about these effects, both for pain and for physical strength,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BQPGQCINCJBP7IY4I3Q2CJEOSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But what exactly connects swearing with greater strength and pain tolerance remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6MZMJZPBINHINCVJEJVHGGPSXA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Over the past few years, Stephens has focused on state disinhibition theory: “the idea that, by swearing, we just get ourselves in a place where we’re more disinhibited, and in a disinhibited state, we push ourselves further, go for it a little bit more,” he said. “So we’ll put up with the ice-cold water for a few more seconds, or [in a strength task] we’ll squeeze on the hand gripper with a little more force.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="WFXMWFGJA5A7PPMJ23J5UTFJIE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="WFXMWFGJA5A7PPMJ23J5UTFJIE"&gt;The optimal swearing dosage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LEWAUX6IMFHDPO663Y2TW3LRKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Up until this point, testing the link between swearing and pain has been done in a controlled, laboratory setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7QSGEJPYYFBMDJOU346PVB5OUM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.samford.edu/healthprofessions/directory/Washmuth-Nick"&gt;Nick Washmuth&lt;/a&gt;, professor of physical therapy at Samford University in Alabama, is focused on the potential for swearing to be used in a clinical context, which means understanding not only the mechanisms by which swearing affects pain but also how a person’s environment, age, how much they already swear in their everyday lives, the intensity of the swear word and other variables could influence the effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="V4YETEN3UFCYHGB2K6FHITKCDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We need to better understand those factors and how they play a role to be able to prescribe swearing in a medical sense, in a clinical sense,” Washmuth said. “Is there an optimal dosage for swearing?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HO5KTL2LWRBKROSJIL24IGEQMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For those who would like to use swearing to help with pain or increase strength, Washmuth suggested starting by selecting a swear word that feels powerful, that you would naturally use if you stubbed your toe, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GJJZDS53NJH7POMWITIMSW7LDA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If no word comes to mind, the f-word is the most commonly self-selected swear word by participants in these studies and is considered one of the most powerful swear words out there,” he said. “Swear at a steady pace once a second to once every three seconds, at a normal speech volume.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TEQM4WVGFFDRTERDFAWODRYZ6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But if audible swearing is not your thing, do not despair. Washmuth is now studying whether internal swearing could do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PMKZOGW5DVARXHII4BEW7CVWYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Swearing out loud is frowned upon in many public places, right?

&lt;p&gt;Penn State University has confirmed three cases of chicken pox on its main campus in State College.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students and staff who were in Mifflin Hall between Feb. 17 and 24 or in the Thomas Building on Feb. 20 between 1 and 3 p.m. may have been exposed, the university said in a recent statement. Penn State is also working to notify close contacts of the infected individuals.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicken pox spreads through airborne particles and direct contact with an infected person.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically develop 10 to 21 days after exposure, and can include the tell-tale spotted rash, fatigue, headaches and a fever lasting several days. Rarely, the disease can lead to serious complications, like infected blisters, pneumonia, bleeding disorders and brain swelling.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination significantly reduces infection risk.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is encouraging people to check their immunization records, avoid contact with those who are sick and wash their hands often.

&lt;/p&gt;

All food has energy, but it has to be digested, metabolized, and converted into ATP so you can use it—and CoQ10 is one of the many molecules that sits inside the mitochondria and helps that process along.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="body-tip css-13fzjfi emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/zachary-mulvihill-md" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://weillcornell.org/zachary-mulvihill-md" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Zachary Mulvihill" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zachary Mulvihill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is an integrative medicine specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr.asoorya/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/dr.asoorya/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Aarti Soorya," class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Aarti Soorya,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; MD, is an integrative medicine physician at &lt;a href="https://groverhealth.com/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://groverhealth.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Grover Health" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Grover Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In doing so, it wards off &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61763795/how-to-reduce-inflammation/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a61763795/how-to-reduce-inflammation/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="inflammation" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and cellular damage, which is why supplemental CoQ10 *might* be beneficial for a number of different bodily functions (getting to those!), at least in theory.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“CoQ10 is one of the most commonly used supplements,” Dr. Mulvihill says, like &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g45125367/multivitamins-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/g45125367/multivitamins-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="multivitamins" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;multivitamins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="fish oil" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;fish oil&lt;/a&gt;, because it’s pretty well-researched and safe to take. And remember what I said about it being versatile? CoQ10 is said to have potential benefits such as helping with cardiovascular health, fertility, and other age-related declining bodily factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;You produce the most CoQ10 in your mid-twenties, Dr. Mulvihill says, and “by the time you're 65, you produce about half that amount.” It’s unclear whether this drop is due to aging itself, or from inflammatory lifestyle factors, like a lack of sleep, that can deplete antioxidants. Regardless, less CoQ10 could mean that the process of converting food into ATP is less efficient, which could impact various bodily systems, per Aarti Soorya, MD, an integrative medicine physician. Also, CoQ10 helps decrease inflammation, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Plus, as you age, you also collect more oxidative stress, says Dr. Mulvihill. Oxidative stress can cause cell and tissue damage, and ultimately might lead to chronic conditions like cardiovascular and neurological issues, per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Cleveland Clinic" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. CoQ10 is an antioxidant that discards free radicals that cause oxidative stress and can contribute to aging, says Dr. Mulvihill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;So, should every woman over 40 be taking a CoQ10 supp? Ahead, read up on the many potential benefits of CoQ10 supplementation, plus possible risks, and who should take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="health-benefits-of-coq10-supplementation" data-node-id="9" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Benefits Of CoQ10 Supplementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Thanks to CoQ10’s ability to assist the mitochondria in our cells to make more energy and prevent excess free radicals that lead to inflammation and cellular damage, the supp may be worthwhile for the following health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-can-be-helpful-for-those-with-heart-conditions" data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It can be helpful for those with heart conditions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Since CoQ10 is essential for your body to make energy, it's the most prevalent in the tissues that use the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; energy, a.k.a., your heart, says Dr. Mulvihill. A majority of research on CoQ10 is around its impact on cardiovascular disease—including heart failure, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;CoQ10 supplementation can decrease vascular stiffness and hypertension (high blood pressure), reduce oxidative stress (an imbalance in free radicals and antioxidants that can lead to cell damage, per the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cleveland Clinic" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and mortality from cardiovascular causes, per a 2021 study in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8151454/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8151454/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Antioxidants" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Antioxidants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This supp can also improve the outcome of coronary artery bypass graft surgeries, including shorter hospital stays for those who supplemented with CoQ10, the study found. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-might-be-helpful-for-people-on-statins" data-node-id="15" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might be helpful for people on statins. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Patients with cardiovascular disease are sometimes prescribed statins, a medication that lowers cholesterol, Dr. Mulvihill adds. However, your body produces CoQ10 in the same pathway that statins block, which can create muscle pain as a side effect. So, CoQ10 supplements can help try to prevent this pain, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Research in this area is mixed, as 2020 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915020301386" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021915020301386" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Atherosclerosis" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Atherosclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that CoQ10 does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; significantly help with muscle pain. However, in Dr. Mulvihill’s clinical experience, he believes people can benefit from CoQ10 supplementation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-could-be-useful-for-improving-fertility-for-women-over-30" data-node-id="18" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It could be useful for improving fertility for women over 30. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As you get older, egg quality decreases and CoQ10 production slows down, says Dr. Mulvihill. CoQ10 might "help maintain your egg quality and reduce the age-related decline in egg quality and quantity," he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;This decline is often linked to a decrease in mitochondrial function and, since CoQ10 helps improve mitochondrial function, in turn it can support healthier eggs and possibly improve fertility, Dr. Mulvihill adds, particularly for women over 30 and/or who are trying to get pregnant or are freezing their eggs. It can also help to try a CoQ10 supplement while you're undergoing fertility treatment like IVF, as long as you have approval from your physician, adds Dr. Soorya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;While more research in this field needs to be done to truly determine whether CoQ10 can benefit your fertility, some research seems promising: A 2024 study in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11345374/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11345374/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Advances in Nutrition" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advances in Nutrition&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that women who supplemented with CoQ10 were more likely to become pregnant compared to those who took a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-could-help-reduce-the-frequency-and-duration-of-migraines" data-node-id="23" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It could help reduce the frequency and duration of migraines.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“There are small studies that show it may reduce migraine headaches, which are much more common in women,” Dr. Mulvilhill says. For example, 2021 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7786797/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7786797/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="BMJ Open" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; concluded that CoQ10 supplementation might help reduce the duration and frequency of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40756970/how-to-get-rid-of-a-migraine-fast/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40756970/how-to-get-rid-of-a-migraine-fast/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="migraine" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;migraine&lt;/a&gt; attacks. (However, the research found that CoQ10 supplementation did not appear to significantly reduce the &lt;em&gt;severity&lt;/em&gt; of migraines.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-might-help-with-blood-sugar-regulation" data-node-id="26" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might help with blood sugar regulation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="it-might-help-with-blood-sugar-regulation" data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="body-text css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If a patient has diabetes, Dr. Mulvihill might talk to them about taking CoQ10 supplements, since they’ve been shown to have a beneficial effect on glycemic control, particularly among those who are diabetic. Having better blood sugar regulation and glycemic control can help those who are diabetic reduce morbidity and increase their life expectancy and quality of life, according to a 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9304683/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9304683/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Cureus" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cureus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As little as 100 milligrams a day of CoQ10 could yield these benefits, per 2022 research in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00332-7/fulltext" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00332-7/fulltext" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="eClinicalMedicine" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It could help people manage fibromyalgia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Some evidence shows that CoQ10 supps may help with fibromyalgia, which is a muscle pain disorder that’s more common in women, Dr. Mulvihill says.

Instead, you should be making the right lifestyle choices, like getting lots of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63941290/blue-light-sleep-health-benefits-study/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63941290/blue-light-sleep-health-benefits-study/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="sleep" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt; and eating nutritiously before supplementing, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="potential-risks-of-coq10-supplementation" data-node-id="38" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Risks Of CoQ10 Supplementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Everyone should talk to their doctor before starting a new supplement, especially if you’re considering CoQ10 and you have congestive heart failure, or you’re taking medications that might have interactions, including &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/coenzyme-q10" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/coenzyme-q10" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="chemotherapy, blood thinning, or blood pressure medications" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u&gt;chemotherapy, blood thinning, or blood pressure medications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says Dr. Mulvihill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“CoQ10 may reduce blood pressure, so if you are on medications for hypertension, this needs to be monitored closely,” Dr. Soorya says. It can also make anticoagulants (blood thinning agents) less effective and increase your chances of clots, as well as interact with insulin (which may affect those who are diabetic,) he adds. One other contraindication: Since supplements are processed through the liver and kidneys, people with issues with either organ should not take supplements without a doctor’s supervision, Dr. Soorya adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Otherwise, at low doses—like 100 to 120 milligrams—for a few months at a time, CoQ10 seems “exceedingly safe and very low-risk to try,” especially if you’re looking to reap benefits in the fertility, migraine, or fibromyalgia realms. Just make sure the CoQ10 is from a reputable brand (like one that has a third-party testing process to verify the ingredients), and that it’s okay with your primary care doctor, Dr. Mulvihill says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Side effects from low doses tend to be rare, but may include mild gastrointestinal issues like nausea or diarrhea, he adds. Sleep disturbances, including a harder time falling asleep and waking up more in the middle of the night, have also been reported, per Dr. Soorya. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ifand-howyou-should-take-coq10" data-node-id="44" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If—And How—You Should Take CoQ10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Neither Dr. Mulvihill nor Dr. Soorya would recommend &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; take CoQ10. Instead, Dr. Mulvihill usually recommends CoQ10 supplementation to these specific patients with:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul data-node-id="46" class="css-9b1pbo emevuu60"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart disease, especially if they’re on a statin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Migraines&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diabetes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fibromyalgia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gingivitis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those thinking about preserving their fertility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="47" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;If you do decide to try CoQ10 supplements and have cleared it with your doctor, Dr. Mulvihill says about 100-120 milligrams a day should be sufficient. The time of day you take it isn’t overly important, but you might want to take it in the morning along with a source of fat (like a fish oil supplement or &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19495380/how-many-calories-in-an-avocado/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a19495380/how-many-calories-in-an-avocado/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="avocado" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;avocado&lt;/a&gt;) as it’s a fat-soluble nutrient, so it’ll be absorbed easier into the body with a second fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="49" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another tip: Try the CoQ10 supplement for three months, then stop for a couple of weeks to gauge whether you felt better while you were taking it, Dr. Mulvihill adds. (FYI: While CoQ10 does exist in some foods like meat and fatty fish, it’s not in sufficient enough doses to make a CoQ10-focused diet worthwhile.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;But I’d be remiss not to also mention that “supplements are there to supplement your diet and lifestyle,” says Dr. Mulvihill. So, in addition to taking CoQ10 supplements, you should prioritize getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night, focusing on quality nutrition, and consistently exercising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img data-dynamic-svg="true" src="/_assets/design-tokens/womenshealthmag/static/images/logos/lettermark.f613c4d.svg?primary=%2523000" loading="lazy" data-testid="dynamic-svg-base" alt="Lettermark" class="css-7mevzh ev8dhu50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;div class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin is a health and fitness journalist based in New York City.

Image via Unsplash.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For much of human history, measles has been seen as a dangerous rite of passage in childhood. It’s more than just a bit uncomfortable, however. As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;gets pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and around 3 in 1,000 children don’t survive. But research shows that even for the majority of kids who make it out without major problems, measles leaves behind a problematic legacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists are finding out that even in children who recover well, the virus doesn’t just infect their bodies—it erases part of their immune system’s memory, leaving them vulnerable to diseases they had already conquered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immune-amnesia"&gt;Immune amnesia&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first major clue that measles had a deeper effect on the body came from epidemiologists tracking childhood deaths. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662"&gt;In 2015, Michael Mina&lt;/a&gt;, then a researcher at Princeton University, noticed something odd: In the years before widespread vaccination, measles outbreaks were often followed by spikes in deaths from other infections. The trend stood strong in historical data from the U.S., U.K., and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t immediately clear at all why this was happening. Measles itself is deadly, claiming more than 100,000 lives per year worldwide, mostly children under five. But the death toll seemed to extend far beyond the acute infection. Mina and his colleagues proposed an idea: that measles was weakening immunity for other pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test this, they analyzed blood samples from 77 unvaccinated children in the Netherlands, taken before and after a 2013 measles outbreak. Study co-author &lt;a href="https://www6.erasmusmc.nl/viroscience/research/researchers/6601028/?lang=en"&gt;Rik de Swart&lt;/a&gt; had gathered blood samples from unvaccinated children during this outbreak. They found that measles had wiped out between 11% and 73% of the children’s antibodies—proteins that help the immune system recognize and fight off viruses and bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;

Image credits: CDC.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications were concerning. If a child had built up immunity to, say, chickenpox, measles could erase that protection, making them almost as susceptible as if they had never been exposed before. The virus didn’t just suppress the immune system temporarily—it hit a reset button.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This seemed almost too severe to believe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm this effect, scientists turned to a different model: monkeys. A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03324-7"&gt;separate study&lt;/a&gt; found that macaques infected with measles lost between 40% and 60% of their existing antibodies. The results suggested that measles destroys a crucial type of immune cell called long-lived plasma cells, which reside in bone marrow and churn out protective antibodies for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In essence, measles was forcing the immune system to forget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-measles-rewires-the-body"&gt;How measles rewires the body&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This finding triggered a race to see what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key piece of the puzzle had actually been discovered earlier. In 2002, a group of Japanese scientists discovered that the measles virus binds to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12008921/"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;. This is surprising because measles is a respiratory virus, so you’d expect it to bind to the lungs or somewhere in the respiratory system. So researchers used this information to piece together what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus gains entry by hijacking specialized immune cells called memory B and T cells, which store information about past infections. Once inside, measles spreads through the bloodstream to organs like the spleen and lymph nodes. As the immune system fights back, these infected memory cells are destroyed, along with their record of past battles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where things get a bit murky. This destruction isn’t total. Survivors &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; gain lifelong immunity to measles itself. After that, the immune system also rebuilds—but not in the way it was before. New memory cells are created, but they’re now measles-focused and less on other, previous infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some researchers call this the “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32395944/"&gt;measles paradox&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s not permanent, with this immune amnesia lasting 2-3 years. During this time, measles survivors face a higher risk of secondary infections. In the past, these secondary infections—pneumonia, diarrheal diseases, and other childhood killers—accounted for a big part of all measles-associated deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-vaccine-that-fully-protects-against-measles"&gt;A vaccine that fully protects against measles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a clear connection between vaccination rates and cases of measles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that existing vaccines also prevent this process. By blocking the virus from infecting the immune system in the first place, it also preserves immunity to other diseases. A single dose of vaccine is 93% effective at preventing measles, while two doses offer 97% protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet, unfortunately, we’re seeing an increase in anti-scientific claims that lead to lower vaccination rates, and the effects are already showing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, an outbreak in Ohio highlighted the dangers of low vaccination rates. The outbreak, which sickened dozens of children, was traced to a community with low MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine uptake due to vaccine hesitancy. Nearly all infected individuals were unvaccinated. Something similar is &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/rfk-jr-says-texas-outbreak-is-not-unusual-hes-dangerously-wrong/"&gt;happening in 2025&lt;/a&gt; in Texas &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/measles-cases-ontario-double-last-two-weeks-1.7470166"&gt;and Ontario&lt;/a&gt;, with the US reporting the first death attributable &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyderx4v8go"&gt;to measles in a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen that if vaccinations drop, things can turn south quickly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2019, a devastating measles epidemic in Samoa infected 5,667 people—8% of the population under 15. The outbreak was fueled by plummeting vaccination rates after misinformation spread about vaccine safety. Ironically, the antivaccination campaign in Samoa was &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-jr-samoa-measles-kennedy-vaccines-pacific-42a9cb583c71f165699b16710884c474"&gt;supported by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, today’s health Secretary in the US. In a desperate effort to control the outbreak, the Samoan government declared a state of emergency and launched a door-to-door vaccination campaign, but not before 81 people—mostly children—lost their lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In light of recent findings, keeping measles at bay is more important than ever. Even if measles itself doesn’t seem severe, its aftershocks can be threatening. The virus erases a person’s immunological history, leaving them vulnerable in ways they never expected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have an extremely efficient weapon against this problem: vaccination. Whether or not we’ll end up us.&lt;/p&gt;

While tossing and turning, you might wonder: Would trying one of the best sleep supplements—or sipping a “&lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/magnesium-for-sleep" target="_blank"&gt;sleepy girl mocktail&lt;/a&gt;”—help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;’s Favorite Sleep Supplements:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In This Article:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe! “Like many tools, there’s a time and a place for when sleep supplements might be appropriate for use,” says &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.drsarahsleep.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.drsarahsleep.com/"}' href="https://www.drsarahsleep.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Silverman, PsyD&lt;/a&gt;, a women’s holistic sleep expert. “Sleep supplements in general may be a helpful tool for restful sleep, but they’re usually more effective when the foundations of a healthy lifestyle and &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-to-sleep-better-guide-schedule-diet-exercise-beauty" target="_blank"&gt;good sleep habits&lt;/a&gt; are in place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why, first and foremost, it’s important to hone the basics of healthy sleep hygiene (no doom scrolling in bed, avoiding &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/when-is-the-right-time-to-drink-coffee" target="_blank"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; too late in the day, taking time to relax and wind down etc.) before turning to a sleep supplement for support. “Even if you’re taking the fanciest sleep supplement on the market, if you’re not prioritizing the basics of healthy sleep (or a healthy lifestyle), the supplement is probably not going to work well for you,” says Dr. Silverman. “There is no magic solution, pill, potion, or supplement that is going to outperform the foundations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you’ve locked in your bedtime routine and &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; find yourself struggling to snooze, then a supplement may be a solid choice. Here, we’ve chatted with sleep experts and nutritionists to suss out the best sleep supplements—whether you’re trying to regulate your sleep during an international flight or quiet your mind long enough to drift off to dreamland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Life Extension Serene Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/5imWxNx3uP4SBwF5p8mDLR5yw6jDqhLG9J43JmDDP8N4ErWzPsvoRfASjsgroQZVNmznCyHouRhtfpRwsLL6MCaAh2RoYdqyEBsx1gAW2HTuWL1apxJAzWYhAKCXQnep1TvvwA6Xbq8gSc6sBYsPkJgCoJyx2gU8WwrhvgEhDGPBfoK3u5fpJF88ZXo88FmJnJVw3YH76rh6iACq4zz8zLxAXHswsaA8HQeeXpdwg2NQ9FqYvpus5Ujewa4RvV3wxRpLn2Qu5hD9TMtxXFZ7z16WUy8NbWW","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Life Extension","dangerousHed":"Serene Sleep Dietary Supplement","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":true,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Life-Extension-Serene-Sleep-Ashwagandha/dp/B0CM42SQN6","contentType":"product","productId":"67bf3c867cf01ffeb8149d48","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":0,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67bf3c867cf01ffeb8149d48","brand":{"name":"Life Extension"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Life-Extension-Serene-Sleep-Ashwagandha/dp/B0CM42SQN6","price":"$14","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/5imWxNx3uP4SBwF5p8mDLR5yw6jDqhLG9J43JmDDP8N4ErWzPsvoRfASjsgroQZVNmznCyHouRhtfpRwsLL6MCaAh2RoYdqyEBsx1gAW2HTuWL1apxJAzWYhAKCXQnep1TvvwA6Xbq8gSc6sBYsPkJgCoJyx2gU8WwrhvgEhDGPBfoK3u5fpJF88ZXo88FmJnJVw3YH76rh6iACq4zz8zLxAXHswsaA8HQeeXpdwg2NQ9FqYvpus5Ujewa4RvV3wxRpLn2Qu5hD9TMtxXFZ7z16WUy8NbWW","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Life Extension&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67bf3c867cf01ffeb8149d48" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Serene Sleep Dietary Supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It:&lt;/strong&gt; While melatonin may be the most well-known natural sleep aid, depending on the reason for your sleep issues, it may not be the right choice.

In other words: Supplements may not be very effective if other lifestyle and health choices get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just like you can’t out-supplement a poor diet or sedentary lifestyle, you can’t out-supplement poor sleep habits and expect to get good sleep,” says Dr. Silverman. “Supplements are to ‘supplement’ a healthy lifestyle and habits that support foundational health (and thus, quality sleep).” She also notes that for people with sleep disorders like insomnia or sleep apnea, supplements may not have a significant impact, as they don’t typically address the underlying reasons for sleep struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s important to ask the ‘Why?’ question when it comes to sleep supplement use. Why is it actually necessary for use? Are you actually addressing the root of the problem?” says Dr. Silverman. “Most sleep supplements are intended for short-term use, and I recommend prioritizing healthy sleep habits first since there’s a lot you can do to naturally improve your sleep quality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, if you try these interventions for a few months and don’t notice any improvement, then she recommends speaking to your doctor or seeking out a sleep specialist for further evaluation and help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="who" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who should take a sleep supplement?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, sleep supplements are most suitable for adults with “occasional sleep troubles who have tried but haven’t had success with lifestyle changes to improve sleep hygiene,” says Moon. “They could also be helpful on a short-term basis for transient sleep issues like jet lag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, if you’re truly deficient in a certain nutrient (such as vitamin D, B12, magnesium, iron), then supplementation may be a useful tool to manage those deficiencies and potentially improve your sleep quality as a result, says Silverman. “I encourage my patients to ‘test, don’t guess,’ meaning test for deficiencies with regular blood work, and target your supplement use based on true vitamin and/or mineral deficiencies.” It’s also important to rule out any underlying medical conditions, including sleep disorders before starting any new sleep supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, reach out to your doctor or healthcare provider before starting any new supplements or herbal remedies to make sure there are no adverse interactions with other medications or supplements you’re taking. This is especially important if you’re pregnant or breastfeeding.

Here are the best options, as recommended by Moon, Largeman-Roth, and Silverman:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melatonin:&lt;/strong&gt; Our bodies naturally produce this hormone, but we make less of it as we age. It regulates the body’s sleep-wake cycle, according to Largeman-Roth. As a supplement, it has the best evidence (compared to other ingredients) to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33417003/" target="_blank"&gt;help people fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;. “Melatonin is likely to be more effective for circadian rhythm misalignment or circadian rhythm disorders (e.g., jet lag, shift work, delayed sleep phase) at low doses and less likely to be effective at high doses for managing chronic insomnia” says Dr. Silverman. “Along these lines, it may also be helpful for occasional use while traveling across multiple time zones to help regulate your circadian rhythm.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tart cherry juice:&lt;/strong&gt; “This is a natural, food-based source of melatonin, plus it has anti-inflammatory compounds,” says Moon. “Research also suggests it may &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5617749/" target="_blank"&gt;help older adults stay asleep&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L-tryptophan:&lt;/strong&gt; An essential amino acid—found in many protein foods like meat, beans, and cheese—L-tryptophan is a precursor to melatonin. “It may &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022395682900127" target="_blank"&gt;help people fall asleep&lt;/a&gt; though it may not affect total sleep time,” says Moon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;L-theanine:&lt;/strong&gt; “This amino acid helps increase the production of neurotransmitters that promote relaxation, like GABA, serotonin and dopamine,” says Largeman-Roth. As a result, it may help promote sound sleep by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6836118/" target="_blank"&gt;reducing stress and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CBD:&lt;/strong&gt; You’ve likely heard about CBD—it certainly had a spike in popularity over the last few years. While it may seem overhyped, Moon says this cannabinoid may &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6326553/" target="_blank"&gt;help promote relaxation&lt;/a&gt; and increase total sleep time, “though individual responses may vary.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnesium:&lt;/strong&gt; “Magnesium is responsible for over 500 functions in the body, so it’s generally important for overall health to have adequate levels of magnesium and proper electrolyte balance,” says Dr. Silverman. Among its hundreds of jobs, one of them is regulating the neurotransmitters involved in sleep. As such, it may help to promote relaxation (including your muscles) and &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.ajmc.com/view/study-magnesium-l-threonate-improves-objective-subjective-sleep-quality" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.ajmc.com/view/study-magnesium-l-threonate-improves-objective-subjective-sleep-quality"}' href="https://www.ajmc.com/view/study-magnesium-l-threonate-improves-objective-subjective-sleep-quality" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promote restful sleep&lt;/a&gt;, says Largeman-Roth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashwagandha:&lt;/strong&gt; Used for thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine, “some studies suggest this adaptogenic plant may help people fall asleep, perhaps by &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank"&gt;alleviating stress and anxiety&lt;/a&gt;,” says Moon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black cumin extract:&lt;/strong&gt; “It’s a clinically-studied ingredient that improved sleep and &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1152680/full" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1152680/full"}' href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1152680/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;helped participants manage stress&lt;/a&gt; and boost natural levels of melatonin,” says Moon, as it contains compounds that may improve sleep quality by reducing inflammation and anxiety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lactium:&lt;/strong&gt; “Derived from milk protein, this clinically-tested ingredient has been shown to help balance the stress hormone cortisol,” says Largeman-Roth. “It’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5331585/" target="_blank"&gt;helpful for getting you to sleep faster&lt;/a&gt; and for promoting better sleep quality.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-HTP:&lt;/strong&gt; “This is a chemical made from tryptophan, after which it can be converted to calming serotonin,” says Moon. “It may increase time spent in the memory and mood &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/5-hydroxytryptophan-5-htp" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/5-hydroxytryptophan-5-htp"}' href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/supplement/5-hydroxytryptophan-5-htp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;regulating REM stage&lt;/a&gt; in generally healthy adults.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, other sleep-promoting ingredients like passionflower, hops, chamomile, lavender, and valerian root may have calming effects on sleep, but there’s limited data to support their long-term use in this area, adds Dr. Silverman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for what to avoid, it’s best to steer clear of any supplements that contain additives, fillers, or “fluff” as Dr. Silverman puts it. “I always recommend sourcing from a company that is transparent about their full list of ingredients and also uses 3rd party independent lab testing for heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury), toxins, and other contaminants to ensure safety.” And, it’s best to avoid high doses of melatonin (think: over three milligrams) as it may lead to grogginess or other unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="bestway" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the best way to get a good night’s sleep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to get a good night’s sleep on a regular basis is to focus on healthy habits that promote quality sleep, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep a consistent sleep-wake schedule.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s always important to establish a regular sleep schedule, ideally one in which you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day (even on the weekends). “This helps regulate your circadian rhythm (a.k.a. your body’s internal clock) and ensure that you allow enough opportunity to achieve your total sleep need each night,” says Dr. Silverman. “I would also argue that keeping a consistent rise time especially helps communicate to your brain when you should be feeling sleepy each night, thanks to your circadian rhythm.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim for natural sunlight exposure each morning&lt;/strong&gt;. Ideally, within the first 30-60 min of waking up, head outside and get some sunshine to regulate your circadian rhythm. “Sunlight is a master regulator of your circadian rhythm, and it dictates the timing of your sleep-wake cycle (among many other circadian rhythms, like eating-fasting, rest-activity, etc.) as well as your mood and energy levels,” says Dr. Silverman.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body on a regular basis.&lt;/strong&gt; “Physical activity helps to strengthen or boost your ‘sleep drive,’ which is the biological sleep process that builds over the course of each day,” says Dr. Silverman. Depending on the person, exercising too close to bedtime can interfere with sleep, however light stretching can be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat well-balanced, nutritious meals.&lt;/strong&gt; Opt for less processed, more whole foods in general, says Silverman. Ideally, try to keep your mealtimes somewhat consistent, as some research suggests this can help regular your sleep-wake cycle. Incorporating certain foods into your diet may also help promote better sleep (Largeman-Roth suggests tart cherry juice). Also, try to stop eating three to four hours before bedtime, so your body has time to properly digest. What’s more, “hold off on high doses of vitamin D, B-12, potassium, or coenzyme Q10 until the morning,” says Moon, as “some research suggests they may interfere with sleep.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a peaceful sleep environment.&lt;/strong&gt; “Keep it dark (block out as much light as you can), keep it cool (e.g., drop your thermostat, use cooling sheets), keep it quiet (per your preference e.g., silence or white noise), keep it comfortable (invest in a mattress that suits your needs), and make sure it feels like a safe, relaxing place to sleep in every night,” says Dr. Silverman. “If you or your partner &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/mouth-taping" target="_blank"&gt;snores&lt;/a&gt;, please consider a sleep evaluation!”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a calming wind-down routine&lt;/strong&gt;. Try gentle stretching, meditation, breathwork, a warm bath, calming music, or reading an enjoyable book before bed. Soothing activities can help signal to your body that it’s time to prepare for sleep, which usually leads to better and quicker rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage your stress level.&lt;/strong&gt; “Stress and worry are the biggest sleep disruptors,” says Dr. Silverman. “It’s important to engage in calming activities that promote relaxation, whenever you can, but especially crucial in the hours leading up to bedtime. The goal isn’t to get rid of stress (it’s kind of impossible); the goal is to lower your stress level and become more resilient to stress so that it doesn’t end up interfering with your sleep.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid large amounts of caffeine late in the day.&lt;/strong&gt; Try to cut-off caffeine consumption at least eight hours before bedtime, and limit any other substances (alcohol, nicotine, etc.) at least three to four before bedtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce artificial blue light at night.&lt;/strong&gt; Lights from your screens can suppress natural melatonin production, and disrupt the timing of your sleep-wake cycle. “Reduce screen time that is mentally stimulating or activating. Keep the light in your home and bedroom dim (ideally starting after sunset, or at least one to two hours before bedtime),” advises Dr. Silverman&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s more, “never try to force sleep to happen,” says Dr. Silverman. “In fact, the more that you try to make sleep happen, the more elusive sleep becomes. Just like the waves in the ocean, sleep comes in waves, and if you miss a wave, trust that another wave will eventually come, and sleep will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if you’ve checked all the sleep hygiene boxes, but sleep remains as fleeting as ever—chat with your doctor about incorporating a sleep supplement into your routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="experts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5XRzZoZ2JPT0c3Tjk1RnZLQVVkc01Eemt6RGNDVDhvdklEaDBEajFucXhzbURHYVRWcUVOaTBaUk9VWjExZGRFOFVqUEtMREttS2ZkRUUtSFo1UWlGX1E4YzJ3</guid></item><item><title>RFK Jr.’s Health Department Heightens Scrutiny of Vaccines - The Wall Street Journal</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5qaGsyMV93emtZU1VJdlZ0WFp0aTF1VlF6VGxUYzd0cU5qVUYzMElUZjdaX3RMcGo3eWpmOFNCOFU4dWYwTkJybjUyaWdQSF94ZndURjdDc3EwWVhnVS0tN3l6M1FzakZOaHdpemQ4Uzd3WUl6R3AyOVZYcjg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="crawler css-j6808u e1ewmsuz12"&gt;&lt;section class="ef4qpkp0 css-1poxbkt-Container e1ewmsuz0"&gt;&lt;p data-type="paragraph" class="css-k3zb6l-Paragraph e1e4oisd0"&gt;Robert F.

Are there solutions for people like us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Sharing a bed with someone who snores can be a constant challenge. It’s also a common one — up to half of adults in the United States snore regularly, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/fullarticle/2800635" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;some data suggests&lt;/a&gt;, and their partners can suffer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’re struggling to sleep through the noise, experts say the first step to getting some rest is understanding what’s causing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-184e9c93"&gt;What leads to snoring?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When the muscles that keep your airway open become relaxed while you sleep, your airway can narrow, causing the soft tissues in your throat to vibrate with each breath, said Daniel Vena, an assistant professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Those muscles go to sleep when you go to sleep,” Dr. Vena said. This explains why people &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/well/mind/alcohol-drinking-sleep.html" title=""&gt;often snore after drinking alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, which relaxes the same muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;People who are overweight or obese tend to snore because extra tissues in the tongue and throat can hinder airflow, Dr. Vena said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Longevity experts even see reducing chronic inflammation as key to healthier aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a classic double-edged sword,” said Dr. David Hafler, a neurologist and professor of immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Inflammation is necessary for survival, and without it our bodies wouldn’t be able to fight off intruders like viruses and bacteria. A sore throat, for example, turns red and is painful because the immune system is fighting the infection to prevent it from spreading, which doctors call acute inflammation, said Dr. Moshe Arditi, a pediatrician and director of the infectious and immunological diseases research center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Localized immune response in the acute stage — to a limited extent — is all beneficial inflammation,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The discovery of inflammation dates back centuries to the Roman encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celcus, one of the first people to define it. Celcus described the core signs of inflammation in Latin as &lt;em&gt;rubor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;tumor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;calore&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;delore&lt;/em&gt;. The terms translate to redness, swelling, heat and pain, which still hold true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At a microscopic level, acute inflammation includes our bodies’ sending fluid, proteins and white blood cells to the sites of infections or injuries, which help fight foreign pathogens and promote healing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;While inflammation can be lifesaving in the short term, there is another type of inflammation, chronic inflammation, that can damage the body over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What causes chronic inflammation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Several risk factors make your body more likely to have chronic inflammation — including obesity, which promotes a low-level inflammatory state throughout the body, tobacco smoking and diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Thaddeus Stappenbeck, chair of inflammation and immunity at the Cleveland Clinic, suspects the modern American diet is a major source of chronic inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Processed foods, refined sugars, trans fats and excessive consumption of red meat are associated with increased inflammation. The Food and Drug Administration banned &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-limit-trans-fats-food-n376266" target="_blank"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-limit-trans-fats-food-n376266" target="_blank"&gt;rans fats&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, and they were finally removed from snacks, bread, cookies and other baked goods in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I suspect that there’s more people with underlying, chronic inflammation than there were in the past,” Stappenbeck said.  “I think about the way we’ve shifted our diet where we eat a lot of chemicals that we are not adapted to consume, and these have a number of effects on our intestines.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Shmerling said, “Lack of exercise, lack of sleep, too much stress, all of those are lifestyle factors associated that are pro-inflammatory.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What are symptoms of inflammation?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Signs may vary, but they include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt; Joint pain that doesn't improve. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Depression. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Weight loss, regular exercise and avoiding highly processed foods can reduce levels of inflammation in the body, Shmerling said. Studies have suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/diabetes/mediterranean-diet-may-protect-diabetes-realized-science-shows-rcna81800" target="_blank"&gt;following a Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, largely plant-based with an emphasis on whole fruits and vegetables, can &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/why-mediterranean-diet-best-health-benefits-rcna134812" target="_blank"&gt;reduce levels of inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s often not an on/off kind of switch,” he said. “We don’t have perfect ways to measure inflammation after making a lifestyle modification, but inflammatory markers can improve with lifestyle changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How chronic inflammation affects the heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2024/23_0267.htm" target="_blank"&gt;129 million people in the United States&lt;/a&gt; have at least one chronic disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The prevalence of chronic disease &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7077778/#:~:text=In%20the%20last%2020%20years,It%20has%20become%20an%20epidemic." target="_blank"&gt;has grown by about 7 million people every five years&lt;/a&gt;, according to estimates from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The causes of chronic disease are complicated, but experts are increasingly convinced that inflammation is playing a role. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a fair amount of consensus that a lot of the chronic diseases we see now in higher prevalence than in the past could well be related to chronic inflammation,” Shmerling said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;What comes first — the inflammation or the disease? When the body is in an inflammatory state, it can start to destroy the very things it needs to function, such as our vital organs and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Ongoing inflammation may lead to heart disease and building of plaque in the blood vessels, which can lead to heart attack and strokes," said Arditi, of Cedars-Sinai. “Long-term inflammation in your brain may lead to development of neurodegenerative diseases by damaging neurons and interfering with normal brain function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Autoimmune disorders like lupus or multiple sclerosis are also linked to chronic inflammation as the immune system starts to attack various parts of the body in friendly fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The body is not distinguishing properly between itself and an outside intruder or a pathogen,” Shmerling said. “There’s chronic inflammation that’s ongoing and quite damaging.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Diseases including Parkinson’s and even diabetes all have inflammatory components to them, Stappenbeck said. Because of inflammation’s close relationship to a host of diseases, he’s not surprised by patients coming in asking to be checked for it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think there’s a desire from patients to say, ‘Can you actually detect this in me earlier, before I get super sick?’” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a test for chronic inflammation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are blood tests for inflammation, but they aren’t perfect. They don't provide clear answers about where the inflammation may be lurking in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There can also be false positives. That's why experts say the tests must be interpreted along with symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;One of the most common tests is called the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a blood test that measures the level of certain proteins that correlate with the amount of inflammation in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Another test assesses c-reactive protein (CRP), a protein the liver produces in response to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Because of the limitations, Shmerling doesn't recommend that healthy people with no symptoms be routinely screened for inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There can be normal inflammation tests even when inflammation is present, and sometimes the tests are abnormal even when it doesn’t seem there is any inflammation present,” he said. “So they’re not perfect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Stappenbeck agreed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I don’t think there’s much of a role for it, actually,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There is some potential for a test called hs-CRP, a more sensitive test that can find smaller increases in c-reactive protein in the blood. High levels of that protein in the blood have been linked to heart attacks and strokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some argue that this test should be done routinely, just like checking cholesterol,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to determine who is more at risk of heart attacks and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The evidence, however, has been mixed, which is why the test isn’t widely performed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“There are people who are so low-risk or so high-risk that it’s very unlikely the CRP is going to help you,” Shmerling said. “There are subsets of people, maybe at moderate risk, where a CRP for cardiac risk could be helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPZWwyMVhCWEtTWENnclhYbzNabHJDZXdndUdTSmtOcnpCWklPM0FWVGlER2lsakRrdXVIdUpsam1YdjYtd2JGSGJZZGpwWE41akFrYjJNdzVGbzlsZG1pX1F2Yjc1c3RGVnF5RkZsMjRkZkRkeXdvTEFwUktHZ3VyaDRCN1VpeWZOQUhSN2twa2ZZdDA4ajZ3M2tEb0pIdzhZN1FqSUxiNkNnUkFh0gFWQVVfeXFMT3czaVdrUWxPRTJOWGRsYjk2UUkwb3pRYmdTVGNnc0wtd2MxeTV4bEZqN1FBejRtR2ExbThOM2g3Qzc3RHRBZFAzOEFhN1BnR1N3YWFMZmc</guid></item><item><title>ZEYNEP TUFEKCI: Texas measles outbreak is even scarier than it looks - WRAL News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxOZlUtVkVBWU5yQUpoVmRYbzN1TW1mLXMyWTRVcUhIc05FXzRic08yNEdHNlpvd3ZzZExfUk5ZZURfWkxhOExtb3hWWDc5c0FPLTRyTWR6anUwZlBPQVYxd2Jpd2pZakdNdTlSbkdITW5QNVA4MHVoOTJ0OVg1UnpkWUoyMjBBV1Yzc19ZMkVfX19uUnlJeFE3NG5pMzNfSFhhNHFXWGo5a9IBSkFVX3lxTE1uSkc4N2JWbXk1TkhqSjNWeWk5UjlIVzVzV2J6SXJNWUVJX0syRUhXdWpKS3B1cl8tWmp5Z0ZXeFBjZU9zaFB0UUN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="svelte-1inb62h body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDITOR'S NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Zeynep Tufekci, a New York Times columnist, was a professor at the UNC School of Information and Library Science and now is a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton University. She is the author of “Twitter and Tear Gas: The Power and Fragility of Networked Protest.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news that an outbreak in Texas has caused the nation’s first confirmed measles death in a decade — an unvaccinated child — is as unsurprising as it is tragic. Spreading largely in rural Mennonite communities that typically have low vaccination rates, the outbreak has already grown to at least 146 cases since late January. Almost all of them are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents whose children got infected but survived are no doubt grateful that their family was spared. But startling research about the virus unfortunately tells a new and very different story, recasting what was previously known about how measles works and making clear why the Trump administration’s approach to vaccines is nowhere even close to meeting the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That research, conducted over the past decade by immunologist Dr. Michael Mina and others, revealed that measles destroys immune cells. Even people who recover from the virus lose much of their immune memory, and therefore the protection they had acquired from prior infections or vaccines to all the other childhood illnesses. This leaves survivors more vulnerable to many other diseases for years afterward. Worse, these victims may now face those childhood diseases, to which they lost immune protections, as older children, which puts them more at risk for complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before vaccines were introduced, &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aaa3662"&gt;Mina told me&lt;/a&gt;, earlier measles infections may have been implicated in as many as &lt;em&gt;half of all childhood deaths from all infectious diseases&lt;/em&gt;. Which, given these findings, would mean the true harm of measles is far greater than its death toll, and the legacy of this outbreak may still be felt years after it’s officially contained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just those families that opt out of vaccinations who are at risk. Measles is one of the most transmissible diseases known to humanity. Children don’t get their first vaccine dose until after 12 months, and full protection doesn’t kick in until they get their booster, usually when they’re between 4 and 6. &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3901832/"&gt;Like other vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, it is less effective for elderly people whose immune systems aren’t as robust, and aren’t as helpful or even a possibility for people who are immunosuppressed because of other factors such as cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the vaccine is highly effective and the rare breakthrough cases — a few in a thousand exposures — tend to be mild. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns, however, that those cases can be vectors for the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only guaranteed way to protect people from this deadly disease is to keep it from circulating in the first place. But nationwide, vaccination rates have been &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm"&gt;trending downward&lt;/a&gt;, producing such large pockets of vulnerable people that outbreaks in one community can now bleed over to another, the way pockets of dry kindling in a forest can help start a conflagration that consumes it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, there are cases across the border from Texas in New Mexico that may turn out to be related. If the disease starts circulating more widely, a great many people will be at risk — regardless of their or their communities’ beliefs about vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newly circulating virus would mean some unvaccinated people would encounter measles for the first time in adulthood, when the danger it poses is much higher. This effect was evident in World War I, when healthy young conscripts from rural areas had their first exposure to the disease in Army training camps. The result was the worst outbreak the military had seen &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1473309915001097"&gt;in almost a century&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of soldiers died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation hearings for health secretary, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., practically begged him to acknowledge, however grudgingly, that vaccines don’t cause autism. It was the easiest layup ever, but Kennedy just wouldn’t go there. Maybe not so surprising, given that he had previously told a podcaster that he considers it his duty to tell random strangers that they shouldn’t vaccinate their babies. Cassidy, a medical doctor by training, voted to confirm him anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Kennedy has had a lot to say about the need to investigate the childhood vaccinations schedule (“nothing is going to be off limits”), claiming that despite decades of widespread use and study it had somehow been “insufficiently scrutinized.” He stopped a sensible public awareness campaign during one of the most severe flu seasons ever, and canceled a key vaccine committee meeting, which may endanger the availability of flu vaccines next year. And he talked about instituting an “informed consent” model for parents that emphasizes vaccines’ possible side effects and no doubt would discourage the vaccinations that have protected Americans from the ravages of infectious disease that in earlier centuries were just a standard part of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I might run out of not just column space but an entire newspaper if I tried to list all the false and misleading claims Kennedy made about vaccines in his many speeches and books. Even so, I was shocked this week as I watched him brush off the Texas outbreak as no big deal. The situation there is “not unusual,” he said, even as he doubled the known death toll without explanation. About 20 people have been hospitalized, he said, “mainly for quarantine,” a fact that the chief medical officer of the Lubbock hospital where the child died quickly &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/texas-measles-death/index.html"&gt;refuted&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re watching it,” Kennedy said, with a casual wave of the hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can probably guess which word he didn’t say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a deadly outbreak, we’d ordinarily hope for a clear, direct call for parents to vaccinate their children. But this is the man who, during a 2019 measles outbreak in Samoa that killed 83 people (79 of them children), actively worked to undermine public trust in the one thing that would have helped most. America, brace yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now, the United States has an official verification from the World Health Organization as a measles-free country, which makes it easier for its residents to travel abroad. If these outbreaks continue we may lose that designation, and other countries may begin to require proof of measles vaccination before letting Americans enter. That choice would be hard to argue with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="nativo-0001" class="svelte-1inb62h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="nativo-0002" class="svelte-1inb62h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="nativo-0003" class="svelte-1inb62h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation in Texas may be the wake-up call that gets some holdouts to bring their children to the doctor and request the protection they need and deserve. In 2015, when an unvaccinated 6-year-old died a horrible, prolonged death from the “strangulation disease” of diphtheria, the distraught parents vaccinated &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/05/inenglish/1433512717_575817.html#?rel=listaapoyo"&gt;their surviving child&lt;/a&gt;, while lamenting they’d been conned by anti-vaxxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should do what we can to spare other families from having to learn such a brutal lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All governors should be launching campaigns to increase measles vaccination coverage, but some states are led by people who promote falsehoods. And some Americans live deep in echo chambers where most of what they hear about vaccines are lies and disdain. It won’t be possible to reverse all this quickly. Perhaps the best we can do is inform parents skeptical of vaccines what they’re risking, before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/28/opinion/texas-measles-vaccine.html"&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Capitol Broadcasting Company's Opinion Section seeks a broad range of comments and letters to the editor.

              &lt;p&gt;If the thought of having a spoonful of plastic in your noggin sounds bad to you, you’re not the only one. Scientists are sounding the alarm over a recent study showing that microplastics can accumulate in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from the U.S. and Canada wrote the commentary, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.61373/bm025c.0020"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in the journal Brain Medicine. In addition to discussing the recent brain study, they detail the overall science suggesting that microplastics are harming the environment and our health. While more research is needed to figure out the best ways to clear these substances from our bodies, people can already take steps to minimize their exposure, the scientists claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Microplastics are any piece of plastic smaller than 5 millimeters. In recent years, scientists have found them &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-in-blood-air-water-everywhere-1851492637"&gt;just about anywhere&lt;/a&gt; they’ve looked—from &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-could-be-affecting-the-weather-too-1851021523"&gt;mountaintop clouds&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-testicles-humans-dogs-sperm-count-1851488727"&gt;our testicles&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/microplastics-are-showing-up-in-baby-poop-1847734053"&gt;baby’s poop&lt;/a&gt;. But a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last month in Nature Medicine from researchers at the University of New Mexico sent off a new wave of concern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The UNM researchers not only found microplastics in deceased people’s brains, they found higher concentrations of plastic in people’s livers, kidneys, or other organs. What’s more, this accumulation seemed to be much greater in recently deceased people, suggesting that plastic exposure has only worsened as of late. They also found a higher concentration of plastics in the brains of people with dementia—perhaps signaling a connection to the fatal neurological condition. The UNM researchers estimated that people’s brains today could be carrying an entire plastic spoon’s worth of these tiny fragments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Nicholas Fabiano, lead author of the new commentary, published today, cautions that there’s still a lot we don’t know about the health impacts of microplastics. But what we’ve learned so far isn’t exactly encouraging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hearing that there is a spoon’s worth of microplastics in the brain was shocking. As a psychiatry resident, this is particularly relevant, since we currently do not know the full extent this may impact one’s cognition or mental health,” Fabiano, a researcher at the University of Ottawa’s Department of Psychiatry, told Gizmodo. “In the Nature Medicine study, microplastic levels were 3-5 times higher in the brains of those with dementia, which raises alarms, however these findings are not causal in nature.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not just the plastics themselves that could be dangerous to our bodies, but the chemicals that seep out of them. Scientists have &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/chemicals-in-plastics-are-a-global-health-threat-says-1845886426"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; over a hundred chemicals in plastic that might harm us or other animals, particularly chemicals that can mimic and then possibly disrupt the regulation of important hormones. These endocrine-disrupting chemicals have &lt;a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/newsreleases/increase-in-cancers-and-fertility#:~:text=Chemicals%20which%20disrupt%20the%20hormone,European%20Environment%20Agency%20(EEA)."&gt;been linked&lt;/a&gt; to greater rates of infertility, certain cancers, and metabolic disorders like diabetes, to name a few. And there are likely other ways that plastics or their chemicals could be affecting our health for the worse.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“The current evidence base (largely based upon animal and cell culture studies) suggests that [microplastic] exposure can lead to adverse health impacts via oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysfunction, altered biochemical/energy metabolism, impaired cell proliferation, abnormal organ development, disrupted metabolic pathways, and carcinogenicity,” the authors of the Brain Medicine commentary wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many unanswered questions about microplastics remain, Fabiano notes. In addition to the unknown long-term health risks, we’re not even sure how these plastics are entering the brain, for instance. There’s also still little we know about how our bodies might flush microplastics away, though some research has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3255175/"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that we can literally sweat out certain plastic-associated chemicals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these unknowns, Fabiano (and &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/plastics-edcs-and-health"&gt;many other scientists&lt;/a&gt;) have called for governments and policymakers to take action and start reducing our collective exposure to microplastics. In the meantime, people can also do things in their personal lives to limit their intake of plastics. These include: switching from regularly drinking bottled water to filtered tap water; eating fewer foods commonly made with plastic, like certain tea bags (that said, some kinds of tea bags are &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/your-daily-tea-routine-is-protecting-you-from-heavy-metals-study-finds-2000568636#:~:text=Tea%20bags%20play,than%20synthetic%20materials."&gt;better than others&lt;/a&gt;), or foods that are known to contain high levels of microplastics, such as seafood, alcohol, and highly processed foods in general; and storing our leftovers in glass or stainless steel containers rather than plastic ones.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

This could reduce microplastic intake from 90,000 to 4,000 particles a year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Bottled water alone can expose people to nearly as many microplastic particles annually as all ingested and inhaled sources combined,” said Brandon Luu of the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Switching to tap water could reduce this exposure by almost 90 per cent, making it one of the simplest ways to cut down on microplastic intake.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/is-it-time-to-give-your-utensils-a-detox-nmlzsklk7" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it time to give your kitchen a detox?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other significant sources include plastic teabags, which can release millions of micro and nano-sized particles. He also highlighted the heating and storing of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Heating food in plastic containers — especially in the microwave — can release substantial amounts of microplastics and nanoplastics,” he said. “Avoiding plastic food storage and using glass or stainless steel alternatives is a small but meaningful step in limiting exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.8"&gt;&lt;div id="056ce1f7-d443-4e04-a07a-d19d88a852f6"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Using the microwave to heat food in plastic containers was also found to release “substantial amounts” of microplastics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;ALAMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The earlier study, published in Nature Medicine, involved tissue samples taken from 52 people who died in 2016 and 2024.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anthocyanins are an antioxidant found abundantly in blueberries. These plant compounds give blueberries and other produce, like blackberries and purple cauliflower, their deep blue and purple hue. However, they offer more benefits than color alone. “Anthocyanins have both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in the body, which may positively impact both vascular and cognitive function,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionbymandy.com/about-mandy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mandy Tyler, M. Ed., RD, CSSD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Research has found that anthocyanins may help reduce the risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More specifically, some studies have shown that eating blueberries might help reduce inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP). Reducing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt; is essential for chronic disease prevention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Optimal intake of dietary fiber has many known &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;, such as helping improve gut health, reduce LDL (known as “bad”) cholesterol and stabilize blood sugar. Additionally, eating fiber may aid in long-term &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/15696/is-fiber-good-for-weight-loss/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;weight management&lt;/a&gt; since it helps you feel satisfied.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Blueberries are a good source of fiber and can help you reach your daily fiber goals. “A 1-cup serving of fresh blueberries contains approximately 4 grams of dietary fiber,” says Tyler.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is approximately between  12 to 18% of the daily recommended intake of 22 to 34 grams.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Higher intakes of anthocyanins, the antioxidant found in abundance in blueberries, have been associated with reduced cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that people with greater anthocyanin intake may have a reduced risk of heart attack and high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Eating blueberries may also help improve your vascular function, supporting your overall heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s an uncontrollable decline in your cognitive health as you age, diet can keep your brain functioning at its prime. And eating blueberries has been shown to support cognitive health. One study found that a group of older adults (65-80 years old) improved their cognitive function after eating freeze-dried blueberry powder for six months.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A smaller study conducted in a younger group aged 40-65 found that those who ate one cup of wild blueberries with breakfast experienced improvements in cognitive function, particularly in episodic memory and executive function.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your immune system does more than ward off a common cold or the flu. It also protects you from more serious invaders that can cause severe damage to your body. Blueberries contain a significant amount of&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; vitamin C&lt;/a&gt;, one key nutrient that helps support your immune health. A 1-cup serving has 12mg of vitamin C—equivalent to 13% of the recommended daily intake of 90 mg for adults.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The anthocyanins in blueberries may also play a role in immune health through various mechanisms, including fighting inflammation and reducing oxidative stress.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries are being studied for their impact on the gut. “A 2024 article in &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt; pointed to a systematic review of 16 animal studies suggesting an improvement in gut microbiome and reduced inflammation with blueberry consumption,” says&lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more research on humans is needed to confirm these claims.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries are a nutrient-dense fruit with a notable amount of fiber, vitamin C, potassium and vitamin K. They’re also naturally low in saturated fat and contain polyphenols—plant compounds known to fight chronic disease.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blueberries are one of the most nutrient-dense fruits, but they can come with risks for certain people. Many plants contain salicylates, including blueberries. “Salicylates are a natural plant chemical that protects a fruit, vegetable or other plant from germs and disease development,” says Gaw. Some people may have an allergy to salicylates, so avoiding them is best since food allergies can lead to anaphylaxis—a severe and life-threatening allergic reaction. Salicylates may also have negative interactions with some drugs, so it’s best to review your current medications with a doctor to determine if salicylates are safe for you to eat.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, some people may have an allergy or sensitivity to blueberries per se. “If eating blueberries causes an allergic reaction such as swelling, stomach pain, difficulty breathing, numbness, or itching, you should avoid them,” says Gaw.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding more blueberries to your diet will help you reap their many health benefits. “Blueberries are incredibly versatile and can be enjoyed in many ways,” says&lt;a href="https://thetoddlerkitchen.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Ali Ellis, M.Sc., RD&lt;/a&gt;. “Some of my favorite recommendations for enjoying blueberries include sprinkling them on top of a bowl of oatmeal or granola, adding them into muffins, or pairing them with some walnuts and dark chocolate for a delicious afternoon snack.”

You can add frozen blueberries to oatmeal before cooking for a robust berry flavor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try dried or freeze-dried: &lt;/strong&gt;Eating dried or freeze-dried blueberries is another fun way to enjoy them. Dried blueberries can be added to trail mix, while freeze-dried blueberries are great as a standalone snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sprinkle over a salad: &lt;/strong&gt;Salads are a great and easy way to up your veggie and fruit servings. And blueberries add a sweet yet tangy flavor profile. The best part of including them in your salads is that you simply wash and toss them with the rest of the ingredients—no chopping required!&lt;/li&gt;
